Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Why?
She okay?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You set me up.
Patrick -- is that- a.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
You the new guy?
That girl -- I --
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Hey -- do you mind?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
He always look so
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Have you seen him?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Are you following me?
You're not a big talker, are you?
Excuse me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
I know, just let me sleep
You don't care if I die
Like you could find one
Dorsey.
Kat! Wake up!
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
What are you doing here?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I hate peas.
Why not?
That ' s completely adorable!
Kat a fan, too?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
What?!
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
In the microwave.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
I could be gone for years.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
How far from here?
I want to go with you!
I have to explore the mainland.
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
No?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Say not here!  Cuba!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
That's what it says.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
The ocean is uncrossable?
May I speak freely?
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Back in the Czech Republic?
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
So you were never a prostitute?
In the kitchen.
What are you doing?
Oh.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
End my career?
But Chief?  Over this??
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Any I.D.?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Two heads.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Is it drug related?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Hey, honey.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Answer it.
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Is there a problem?
This all you want?
In here, says he wants a million.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Get in the bathroom!
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Yes, the money is good.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
He's my collar!
I'll send a cop back for you.
He knew all along.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Get outta here!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Yes?
Yes.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Hal?
Well, don't worry about it.
CONTINUED
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
How about chargin' the battery?
What's the matter with my place?
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
No way to start a partnership.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Just tell me about the money.
Not likely, convict.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah?
Bullshit red tape.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
What am I wanted for?
I'm all wet.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Call me later.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
How do you know?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Tell me.
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Rosalie, you okay?
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
And then?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't need one.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I'm not going.
Apipoulai!
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Dinoine chagantakat!
Love...
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
I told you not to read all that crap!
Have you identified it?
Talk English Doc.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
Recommendations.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Am I disturbing you?
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Okay, I believe you.
... What's going on?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
You couldn't?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
What do you want?
I'm telling you...
What the fuck... !
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Why don't they come to me?
Celebrity Films.
I know what you did.
Who is this.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
You almost went over your limit.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Specialty product.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
No.
Okay, I follow you so far...
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Yes... ?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
No... no... no...
Okay, I'll take it all.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
We'll figure it out.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
Kristen, what happened?
You're his sister, right?
How long have you been awake?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Nice neighborhood.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What's wrong with me?
You don't get it, he's after me...
Is that who you're waiting for?
The tickets.
About him?
There you go.  Love you.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
You think that's the place she's buried?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I thought about that.
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Who?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
My father!  He's not - ?
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
Reef!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Huh?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
We're stuck tight!
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
That's what I said!
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
You might not kill it.
Mmm.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
What happened?
This way.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You stayed away?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Those are the Hoyts.
Do what?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
What then?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
No.
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I figured you already heard.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
Want to buy?
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
How's she doing?
You okay?
Yeah.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Take care, Wade.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
Where... how'd you hear that?
Sleeping.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Love! I'm made of love!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
No shit.
What about her?
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sure he's busy.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
How was...  ...the ballet?
Daddy...
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Now, or he dies, please.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
Finally, we can bargain.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
You know what?
The fax machines.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
One.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
This is the President.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
What is it, Mary?
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Elaine.
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Elaine.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine!
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Set!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to live anymore.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
And a little ice.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Yes, Captain?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Roger.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
And that fits?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
You know that guy?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Where'd you get this?!!
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
But there's no more drug.
What is it?
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, Sykes?
Departmental policy.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
I told them to fall back...
Sir?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Let's go!  Let's go!
What's this?
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Thanks.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
What did you say?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Gone.
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
The marriage!
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I want to go!
Now?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Why? People fart backwards.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Well, don't do that again!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
No one.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I'm not telling you.
No. Don't answer it!
Give me one reason I can understand.
Excellency!
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
What do you mean?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
He's adorable!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
I said play!
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
Really?
Yes?
Yes, where?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
How many?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Good morning, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Not that I've seen.
Is he working?
Are you Herr Mozart?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Why not?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
What for?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
With all my heart, Mozart.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What dead? Who is dead?
Where is your wife?
You mean she's not coming back?
No, please.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Of course.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Do you have it?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
Exactly. A dance.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
So?
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Do you hear me?
You cannot say that!
Yes.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
But not his body.
He's setting that play to music?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
The American? Yes, duck.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Yes, sir.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
What did he say?
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
It wasn't a lunatic.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Call me Alex.
My best friend. My very best friend.
Yes, go on.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Your dead friend Jack?
Bathroom.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
What?
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
Has he been refusing food?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
There were witnesses?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you see Jack?
I really don't know.
Yes.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
She's a jerk.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Okay.
Hello.
It's a five-pointed star.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Jack, we'd better go.
I have no idea.
Heathcliffe.
I don't know. Come on.
It's moving.
What's the plan?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
I'm not listening!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
What can I say, Jack?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Hello, there. What can I get you?
No.
Oh.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
Why not?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
What?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Let me see your cash book, will you?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Well . . .
Where is he now?
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
What time did this thing happen?
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
Absolutely.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Hello, Helen!
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Did you talk to him?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
It couldn't have been earlier?
He's not bad at it.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
You are a fine figure of a man.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
I think I recognize you.
You're not scared, are you?
She had a moustache.
Thanks for the help.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Yep.
Beautiful.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Cannon or Gatling?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Where is Jesse James?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Then why can't I go in there?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
So?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Such as?
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
She's still talking to Jesus.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
Bob's upset.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Riders --
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Let the law --
What?
Yes ma'am.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Why, yeah.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
You wouldn't have done that?
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
So you can't tell me anything?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
I haven't seen you around here.
Do...what.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Where are you going?
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Lucky, I guess.
Like what?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
Dorsia.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
When?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Patrick?
Who?
Jean? Sorbet?
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Sorry. 
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
No. I really don't.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Who?
No.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Bad habit.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He had a yacht?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Oh.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Well, I could he wrong.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
No hash browns?
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I'm so hungry.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
It's...it's...all right.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is it over?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Teddy was killed last night.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
Nothing.
I remember.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Milo?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
What?
What?!
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
How's it going?
Milo. What's up?
I heard what happened.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Okay, #2.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
...You wanna work -- here?
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
What about "60 Minutes."
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Does he know you know?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
It's three years old, it --
That kid's the great white hope.
I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Oh, and Austin...
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Be careful.
Good on ya, man.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
My wedding tackle.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Hi.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
What did you say?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
He's asleep.
We don't judge here.
... preserve...
... love ...
Promised? Who promised?
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
We want to help...!
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Choices?
I was about to throw in the towel.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
As per mother's instructions.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Did he say who?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Barely.
This must be the last straw.
I could save you the trouble.
And do you trust me?
Winning isn't everything.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
In your operation.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
The last one you'll ever see.
You said ... one shot.
What's happening?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Cole...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
The best.
Mr. Thomerson.
Nice shot.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
What's the matter?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Your mother's not dead.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Let go of me!
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Olivier's in that, right?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Debbie.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Been ripping off fire stations?
What, you've never seen one before?
Hey! You don't know me --
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Hey.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Brian, look --
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
You're selling dad's boat?
Saw what?
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You're back.
I work for city hall.
I could use a date.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Your brother was a good man.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Aren't you even curious?
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
I was ahead of my time.
Okay.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Anyway, down here, take a look...
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Inspector.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
You took the chalice.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Give me some?
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
What do I do?
What do you do?
I'm not smiling.
Damn skippy.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
My tap shoes.
To what?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
What are there character traits?
Who are the other characters?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Let's get him over to the bed.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
How did you know?
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
So they can be on TV.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Where is he?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
How did you get this gig?
Let Myrna finish.
You sing and dance?
What do you mean?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
No, before my time.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
You leave something out?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
I believe they will deport you.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
You want my heart?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Who?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
I don't want to go --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
What business?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
You know it's not like that --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
His chest was hamburger --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
No. I said Dunbar.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
You mean not enough to save you.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You're kidding.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
I didn't shoot West...
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
That bugs you too?
Yeah.
So what now?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
Nah.
I don't think I want to hear this --
The faggot speaks.
He said what?
No one else heard it?
It won't work --
Wrong answer --
Who, Levi --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Yeah.
We know.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Bloom!
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
What did she look like?
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
I know.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I can.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
You think I'm up for it?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
I thought you weren't dying.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
Like this.
It's unbelievable.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Is he awake?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
What for?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Yes.
Do you like it?
What?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
You're asking for my documents?
Do you believe in love?
How is bank?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
What was her name?
I'm sorry.
What does it mean?
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
Yes?
Is your niece older than 12?
What do you need?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Let go of my arm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Don't need none.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
LET ME GO!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
I'm here with you.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Don't think that'd be wise.
Looks like you know a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
This Rae... you get with her?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
Why's his britches round his knees?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Or what?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
The hell is this shit?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Yeah?
Are you wasted?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Get rid of it.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
This should be it...
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
A resort city, Beppu.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Thank you.  You have one?
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.
Ich said you left.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
He drinks.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
How big a package we talking about?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
He knows what he's doing.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Why are you staring at us?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
And what in your estimation works?
I like you.
Money?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
You're going to be over the limit.
What night?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Are you apprehensive?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
Why not?
Is there anything else?
Yeah.
Who is this?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Do you dream?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Yes.
No.
How many questions did it take?
What desert?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
A tortoise.  What's that?
But I understand what you mean.
How come you were in my truck?
Pris.
Hi!
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
You're lost?
You don't?
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
And that's it?
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
How's that?
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Sure.
When do you need her by?
I told you I've never driven before!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
No.
A card?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
I've got to go, now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Like one of Mom's?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I love Lucy!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I don't see anything!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
This is your bedroom?
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
If I...you know...
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
What did you wish for, Adam?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
I want him to at least see the sky!
What are you doing here?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Eve?!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
To bed?
Yes, you do.
Or have perfect table manners.
What?!!
Gay.
Give it back to him.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Where?!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Anything you can tell me?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
Is Sandy part of this?
Jeffrey.
I wanted to see you.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
No. Come on.
Do you know?
You don't?
Then don't talk about killing.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I liked being with you last night.
Come in.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
I sure don't hate you.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Do you love me?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Hello, daddy.
What?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
God, you scared me.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Terrible boring.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
You really want to do this, don't you?
What's the plan.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay, yeah, call.
Yeah.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
What's with Mike?
You saw a lot in one night.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
You were late.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yeah.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You look beautiful.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Fuck you.
Yes sir.
I can't find the second one, sir.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Anybody see ya?
Shit.
They got nothing.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We... met them last night.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
For what?
Where the fuck are you going?
Aye.
Yeah?
And number three, Dolly.
You... oh god, why?
Pee...Per...Man.
How many bodies, Greenly?
Witness?
Oh my god!
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Hey, Murph.
So?
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Have you no fear of God?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Is it back in?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Holy shit.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
What about them?
I'll just say it.
What the fuck is going on here?
Maybe he just went to the store.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
What?
We've got sixteen dollars.
I know.
Who's in the car?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Dignan. Take it easy.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Yes. I do.
We all set?
Take your second position.
Good. It's supposed to be.
Who tripped the alarm?
Come on.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
What do you mean?
Where?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
That was a test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
No, that door over there.
This is good.
See you.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
Anthony, I --
Why do you say that?
Give him a second.
Were you born in Mexico?
What?  What?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Is that him?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Is he chasing us?
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Everything OK?
He's having a heart attack or something.
How long do you have to go?
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Is he in?
The grammar?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Where did he go?
He left his sweater.
You like Chicanos?
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
Will it track back to us?
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Do you know what his budget was?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Sir...
Lots of people...
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
Front. Use your teeth.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know who that is.
-- my coat -- but we should --
But you're sure?
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
No. You never worked Berlin.
What's that?
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
Do we know what this says?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Someone dead from this household?
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
We don't split up!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I do not confess.
Thank you for accepting.
I'm not just saying it!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
It's battle I want, not talk.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
You know the answer to that.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Sure...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Where... where are my clothes?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Why's that?
There's one major hole in your story.
I was?
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Listen to me good, Evan...
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Will he keep his word?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Here you are.
Yes, something.
Do you know where they are?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
No.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
And then?
No, not yet.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Hello, Sam.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Rick? Who's he?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
No, Captain, please.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Good evening, gentlemen.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
What, again?
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
This is the end of the chase.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
What friend?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Our expenses?
Hello?
Boss!
No.
Good. Then have a drink.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Save some for tomorrow.
Thirsty.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too much, I'll die.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
You can't make it.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
As much as anybody.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Merry Christmas eve.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He's your cute thing.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
No.
There isn't any us.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Yeah?
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
What happened to your pants?
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Can you find her?
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I braided them.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Thanks.  For everything.
Only if you can afford it.
He'll need clothes... some money...
Dr. Homer Wells.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Where's Mandalay?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
What's an immigrant?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Migrants?
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
What's that? What's it called?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
Where's the name sheet?
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Uh... sure.
Do you like to read?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Just the last three weeks.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
After you cut her loose.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
So we go to the bar.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Well, this is just fucking great...
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
How much?
Listen, Scooter --
Come here. Feel this.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Something stupid.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
Mr. King, I think --
And some new clothes.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Sounds respectable.
No, I want my cut!
What do you want? An apology?
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
It's not history.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Did he buy it?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
No. Thanks.
I got scared.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What's the Blue Book price?
How about five hundred.
She went back to South Africa.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I found her in bed with someone.
Good night?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I couldn't resist them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You want me drunk?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I want to hear it.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Are you drunk?
Marion, stop this.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
You will?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
How did you hurt your hand?
I know that. But you can now.
It won't.
But if it does.
Let it go.
Do you?
Ross.
You've been avoiding me.
I'm Lucy.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
We check every four days.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Where's the magnet?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
What makes you so sure?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
Girlfriend?
That hair will have to go.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
What was that, I didn't hear...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Thanks.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Of course.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Fred.
I need a diameter approximation.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
You know what I think about, Talby?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Oh, yeah?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Same old story.  Not interested.
A grand.
You're light a deuce.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
You didn't...
Hello...
I don't want to move away.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Wasn't that hard.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
A girl.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I don't know what to say.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
Nothing on Hannah?
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
A fog bank.
Gotta go.
Please...
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
You get it when I get her.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Easy Sketchy.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
What about this?
Thanks, miss.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Hawk.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What's it worth to you?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
One more time in English.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Go ahead, Jam.
They're not idiots.
Mom, what're we...?
Yeah.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
But we took the keys?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Look, you can have my wallet...
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Beg pardon?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Why did you make me flood the school?
So... you just moved here?
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
You mean soap?
That was a compliment.
Where are you going?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Will you please talk to me?
Where is she?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Cellar door.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Follow him where?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Yes. I went to jail.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
I think now that he might...
Frank is going to kill.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Her name is Gretchen.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
That's enough.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Is Mom okay?
Really?
Airport Ho-Jo!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Bye mom.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Loretta, shut it.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay?
That bitch from...
And the year before that?
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
That's enough!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
We need more bars!
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Take a letter.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Father...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
What's the matter with you?
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
He only weighs ten ounces --
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Give me that again!
Bah!! 
No... it was a seven letter word.
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Good! How is the patient?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Are you comfortable here?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Want to come out?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
What's this?
My... name is...
John... Merrick
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
No, John, not one that I can see.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Very smart indeed.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Are you the proprietor?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Who, Father?
What's the matter?
What?
Yes.
We never went to bed together.
You're as bad as my father.
Just give me a hand.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
He wants to kill US!
Yes.
What -- rape?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Scream.
Louder.
What a stupid idea.
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
What?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I... I... KILLED her...
What are YOU doing here?
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
I've got you!
Who gets killed?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Yeah... well...
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Who's that?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Help!
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
He drove me mad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Why?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay, really.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
You're sure? It's cold.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
I don't know.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Well, I should probably get going.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah?
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
You're not ready.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Come up and see me... now.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Probably.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Me too. There's this poem --
I knew.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
She's so sexy.
Naomi.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm sorry.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Stan... c'mon...
See you later, alligator.
'kay.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Yeah.
Oh.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Thanks.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
This one's history. Moving on...
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
You don't?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
You're political, then?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
That's Jellybean!
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Whose fault was that?
A born freak can only go uphill.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Holy shit...
We have a man down...
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What happened?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Does he know that?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Patch me through to him.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Skipper...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
It's complicated...
It's 2041...
Explanation?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
I told you... She won't let you leave...
We don't have time to fart.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Where is it, where is it...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
What is it, Starck?
...repeat, we're armed...
We have to do something, oh God...
Hey...
What?
What is it?
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I had it at four.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
What the --!
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
What is that thing?
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What? What do you mean you --
Are you kidding?
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Raising the shields.
Victor, your scar --
Of course.
It's the first door on your left!
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I don't know. I was just curious.
Does Mom know you have company?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Well...
You're a really good kisser.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Take that back.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Did you get her name?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
No Damone. I don't understand.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Are you Linda Barrett?
All right.
Don't you like him?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
It was okay.
It was nice.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
But what are you going to do?
You just ripped my card in two!
Thanks. So do you.
Are you really nineteen?
This is a nice car.
Do you know what you want?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
I made a fool of myself.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
A major!
Oh, my God!...
Jesus! Did I say that?
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Jesus creeping shit!
Not much. Why?
GO?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
When does this thing stop?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Jesus.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
The cops?
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
No, she's looking for you.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We'll meet in three hours?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Wha?
We'll be food, dickheads!
We just smeared a skunk.
What?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Sure.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Covered.
Nine?
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
They were all over the place.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Fine, Chief.
SHIT.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Yeah, I'll go.
What's wrong?
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Oh...
Are you lying to me?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Frances?  Oh no.
'Forgive'...? For What?
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
I'm not!
Hello, Harold.
What does Clifford say?
GET OUT!
...Yes.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
...Don't you?
But I'll never win that.
Were you a drug addict?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Thank you.
See you next weekend?
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Not me. But other people seem to.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Enh.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Kaminski.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Yeah.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
What a man!
Huh?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Yeah. I don't know.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
I'm not sure.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
...Is that not true?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Your big speech?
You got it.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
I think I need a little air.
At one. Promise?
Don't... talk crazy.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Where are you going?
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
This whole thing is a joke!
What?
No!
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
Yes.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Why... her?
She's not for you.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
It's been months. It's not like him.
I should go. I should leave today.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
What kind of God is He to will this?
I wish to be your husband.
Victor. I love you,
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Brother and sister no more.
A warming wind.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
No. But someday.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
You can't. Death is God's will!
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
You know of it?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Trouble?
Good point.
I'll go check on Brenda.
I'll be along.
Sure.
You said we were special.
You just had some lucky shots.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
I love you.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Best over...
It's beautiful...
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
I got to.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Just my son and I.
You said it was just you and your son.
Yeah, follow us.
I'm exhausted.
What are you gonna do?
You don't believe in suicide.
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
On the dresser.
Come again?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
You won't let him touch her?
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
In the Winnebago.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I promise.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
No!
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Seth, if you were me --
Richard!
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
I did?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
Where are you?
Yeah.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
That's what I hear.
Got it.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
Same rules for everyone, sir.
I'm not sure what --
Shit.  Think we're had.
Smoke her.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Yes, dear.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
I think you look beautiful.
Do you, uh, know...
Maybe half.  Not even.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Got it.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
I don't know.  Seems...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
He's not going to do it.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
What the hell are you doing?
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
I think we should leave now.
I won't and nothing you say-
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
He's a twit!
What the hell is going on?!!?
What's happened?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
But you don't?
How did you come to that conclusion?
Shit! Go!
Go. They're off again.
... What does that mean?
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
No, I'll kill you. .
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
We're alive!
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Closer?  I can try.
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Yes.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
But... Inside, I have seen-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
How old are you, Captain?
I'm so inclined.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
They are... friends of Congress.
Makes you gag.
Oh, come now...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
The man is a traitor!
Like flowers after the snow melts.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
We're leaving them?
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
What the hell are we doing?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Well, this must be about something!
You know very well who it is that I love.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
Let's get you darker!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
So where's the money?
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
That's all there is to it, huh?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Keep going.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Part of it, yeah.
Once.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
One of his best parts.
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Whatta you think, Chill?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You broke in?
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
I want to know.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
You seem to feel fine about it.
What's wrong?
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
How about now?
You think that's funny
A what?
Try Wednesday.
What is it?
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
What do you propose?
I think you know.
The radio!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
Conveniently enough for you.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
What's slow?
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Coffee.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
He needs a doctor.
Couldn't sleep.
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Victims of what?
That much I think we've already established.
Nope.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
What?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
How's that?
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
Better late than never.
Will you get off my back for once?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
So what do you think?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Hi Josh.
What do you mean "why"?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
That's just the way I am!
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Did you sign up yet?
There's my dad with Joanie.
You're better at it.
What's he doing now?
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Like what?
Which one?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Great...
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
May I ask what you're doing?
How much is this?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Punk rock is over!
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Jesus!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Well are --
Shh!
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What, like a girdle?
Oh yeah?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
How can you be so sure?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What? You're kidding me...
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
...What do you mean?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
I don't know... where is she, then?
That slut!
Thank you, doctor.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
Then why do you stay?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You mean nobody died?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
We need to talk.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
How many do you think they've killed?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
For you.
Do you love her?
Soon. 
Where is it?
Four should do it.
Why so many?
Where do you go next?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
What are you working on, Egon?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Sorry!
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Then why have you come?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You were the one who got me in.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Ready?  What is it?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
What?
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Do you want this body?
But why?  The students love us!
Did you see it?  What was it?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Don't cross the beams.
What is it?
They will.
Third floor.  Get down here,
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
What?  What popped in there?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
What are you talking about?
Yes?  Go on!
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
You cannot die.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Servis made it through again?
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Serious stuff...
My troops don't make policy.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
I killed too many barbarians.
Who the hell are you?
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
But could you try?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Yes.
Did they ever find out?
Yes.
I do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
You mean the one who --
Is that him over there?
Come in.
I said I think it is.
I don't understand --
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Why?
What are you looking for?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
You a student?
Oh -- no sir.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Could I make one phone call first?
I'd rather not.
Hello.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
Yes sir?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Why not?
Yes.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
So?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Her portrait?
I think I'll go to bed.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
I know that. But I'm --
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Yes.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want me to get it?
Do you want to get it now?
Why don't you get it.
To tell you?
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Why don't you watch?
Either one will be fine.
This is all terribly wrong.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
What?
Always?
Calm down, Benjamin.
Thank you.
Well how long has this been going on.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Why did you do that?
Don't tell Elaine.
What was your major?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
I'm curious.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Good.
No.
Now don't start this.
Did I say that?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Go home now.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
I'm just --
-- worried?
Well --
No. She doesn't know about it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am not threatening you.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
No, I don't.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Benjamin Braddock.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
The pearls are in her room.
I don't like your tone.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Have you seen it?
You?
No -- why? -- should I?
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
I feel sorry for him.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Going?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
I want to be alone.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
There.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Grusinskaya --
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Ready, Kringelein?
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
How's the beautiful lady?
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
Any letters?
This gentleman can have my room.
Send his bags up to my room.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
You like music?
Really?
Please -- please!
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
What?
You're a little too fast.
Cotton Company --
Definitely off.
Tomorrow morning.
Well -- you want me?
I understand perfectly.
Insolent young cub!
Baron!
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Then, it's all over?
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
I can't dance tonight --
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Good morning, Suzette.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
-- We must do something...
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Next week.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Your what?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
I know.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
So what's your story today?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Why?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
I don't see why not.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Scram. Go home.
All? It ain't bad.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Her job.
Get well soon.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
You were gone for a while.
) What?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Why am I here?
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Where?
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
My god...
Do you know who did this?
No shit?!
You sure?
My office?
Forget it.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
Can I come in?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
What?
Michael Meyers.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Wait.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
God, what's wrong with him?
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
What now?!
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Why did you take Jamie?
Yes?
I dunno, boy.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Go home!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
How are you, honeybunch?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Mhravitch.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
Sir?
Will you go to bed?
No.
No.
What do you do for a living?
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
No.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
What are you going to do?
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Unless she has nerve.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
Sounds quite beautiful.
Honor, I suppose.
No.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Ooops.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
What for?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
New lives begin!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Alice got married again.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
How did she lose her feet?
Is Norbert still here?
Then who flushed the toilet?
I don't get it.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Doing what?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
He'd assume we had.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Did you see him?
Is he all right?
Is he coming home?
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
What was it?
Marry me instead.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
You were wonderful.
It's true.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
The what?
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
That's been said before.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Not true.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Yeah.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
I'm getting angry.
How many weeks?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
You making a feature?
You know her?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
No.
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
More or less.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
It's not quite the same thing.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
They are the same.
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Hello?
Mast?
I've got a meeting...
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
No.
No.
But the police...
I'm only human, you know.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Like what?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where!
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
But I...
Hold it, mister.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Huh?
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
How long have you been driving?
But there is a family resemblance.
No.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Not very.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Eh, no.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Yes.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What do you think?
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
But I don't play anything.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
The ice is melting.
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Well, why don't you?
Just like this.
You sure have a way with people.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Oh, Harold. 
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Farewell?
I feel giddy.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
To whom?
Is Sunshine your real name?
Do you play?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
What about the draft?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
You think so, sir?
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Well, I don't...
Souvenirs?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
The box. I need the box.
What?
What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Story of my life.
Don't get psychic with me.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
That's all for you, Sammy.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You are a Catholic??
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
What are you trying to say?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
No. Don't --
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Myers?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What was that??
Are you sure about this?
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
Pardon?
Hi.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
The box... you opened it. We came.
This isn't for real.
You did this before, right?
Just in time.
I have to speak to my father.
No.
I'm brother Frank.
Well?
What happened to you?
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Later.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Let me see.
I said no.
You're still blaming me.
Where are you?
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
I'll be down in a minute
I don't know where to begin...
I suppose that's right.
I... suppose so, yes.
Why don't you do the same?
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
You'd like the house.
What are you drinking, love?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
...maybe we should never have come back.
Maybe you should give it some time.
Not that late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I've been better.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Ehh.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
So?  You even said they're good.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
Where's Rob?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Let's not.
Well we rang $900 today.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I suppose so.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
I haven't felt like it.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Hello.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Don't forget your CDs.
Are you alright?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
No, but...
I'm alright.
Hi.
Wanna go to dinner?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Are you persuadable?
Fair enough.
About what?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
It's a great song.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Yeah.
Which way are you going?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Well we don't.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
-Okay okay.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Good reflexes.
Someone beat you.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Who is he?
No.
You had to do _nothing_!
You've been listening to rumors.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Yes.
Maybe it would do us both good.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
I hope I never get that old.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That would be difficult to explain.
I didn't kill the watchman.
What about that family in '31?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Forget it.
A murder.
You're an asshole, Moran.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
I was nearly killed.
Pheasant.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
Why?
Me arm hurts.
Go to hell.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
But why be so concerned about me?
That is not me.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Far away.
David.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
I don't know.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
_Answer_ me.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
You're wrong.
I want you to come to me.
No.
It doesn't.
I presume it's a sword.
Where were you Tuesday night?
You're one of William's kids, huh?
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
No. Roy. Roy V.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
But --
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
Where'd she go?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Yes!
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
No -- she didn't.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Ts! Ts! Ts!
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Call Duffy!
No, you don't!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Done what?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
You can break it, can't you?
You've had a better offer, eh?
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Say, could I meet him?
What now?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
I get it!
Huh!
Where's Bruce?
What tickets?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
What!
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Anything you want, Boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
Well, that about covers everything.
Open up there, will you!
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Gus, this --
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
That's murder!
Where is he?
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I won't.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Now, Hildy --
What did you do with her?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
There goes another scrub lady.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Huh?
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Mother!
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Earl, you must never do that again.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
How much do you make a week?
Here's the picture of my wife.
The door was locked.
I don't mind.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Would.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Why not?
Here's to music. And absent friends.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
What did he say?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Tiny's home.
Drink up, it's party time.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
You know... a couple of queers.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
What's he so excited about?
Check this out.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Drive through it!
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
How long is that gonna take?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Don't even say it.
You got to be fucking joking.
I still don't.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Well hello, officer.
Get in... now!
Turn up this road.
Tell it to my daughter.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Gabrielle.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Fine.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Please. I look a mess.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
It's okay, Puff.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
Yeah?
Three foot one.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
You are a therapist, right?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
What?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You are an animal.
Good. Making progress.
Of course not.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
How come?
So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Oook. Oook.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Puff, put the gun down.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Wait!
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Huh?
I'm ready.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
And a fact is a fact.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Oh, about five hundred.
I'm buyin'.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Whaddya been so far?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
You know everybody, don't you?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Where?
Sure.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
They're fine.
Tell her what?
Well, here it's half.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Maybe. You want to play?
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Well... well, now.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Quit. He's too good.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
With what?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Yeah. You must come again.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Half and a dollar.
Call it.
You quittin', friend?
What time does the bus leave?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
Hey!
Why did you do that?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Give it to me.
You wanna drink?
No. You?
Would he know?
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what's so funny?
Why should I?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Why?
Go on back to the hotel.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Where do you come from?
I hear you've been looking for me.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
How much do you remember?
What?
I only protect myself -- !
We don't know that --
Yes.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Need some gas?
Only got one kind.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
I was so scared.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
Mr. Gardner, I --
George, where have you been?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What's his family background?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
David? How'd you get this number?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
What the hell is this?
You try Martin?
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
But Mr. President...
And our troops here?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Where's it headed?
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
Yeah, but what an entrance!
I'm a dancer.
No. Exotic.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stop it.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Above American soil?
Mr. President?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Marcus!  I did it!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
What about you?
The Word of God...
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
What's that?
Mine, too.
What are you going to do?
It's important!
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
I came here to save you.
How did you she was a Nazi?
What???
What?
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
My Diary's in Berlin.
All right Dad -- tell me.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
I was the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Well... I can't think of anything.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
What did you find, Junior?
Ready?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I'll take the camels.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
What?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
I ride with you, Indy?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
India...
What'd he say?
And then they took their children.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Don't let it pull you deeper!
What?!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
What does the writing say?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
What?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
And they don't even know what it really is.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
Where are you,...Al?
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
Yes?
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Why don't we go home?
...I need to make a phone call.
Who am I?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Oh...Gooood!
I did. I brought you back here.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Sue them.
Corridor A.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
...and a license to kill...
Oh yeah, to what?
I don't want to eat it.
It's sand.
She doesn't seem to understand.
Wait.
What happened?
Where are you going?
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Much too blue.
Mind your own business.
They both look good to me.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What am I supposed to do?
Osaka?
What do I do?
Follow her.
Come on, she's getting away.
You have to! Quickly!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
He was with Gruner!
You sure this will work?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
You just got a Mickey.
It'll remind me of you.
Can you fly this?
Who's our little man?
PEM115!
That crazy guy?
It is to me too.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
I will?
Joe.
Take the card.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Yes...What is it?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
And you?
As if your mind's not all there.
You talk to yourself.
Why did they leave?
You work for Ryuji?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
This business is over.
What'd he steal?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why'd you ask him.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
I can't fly it.
Now what?
You can say that again. What do we do?
What?
Kiss her you fool.
Riuji?
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Why'd you invite me here?
Why not?
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I heard them.
Mom.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What was that about?
And what are you implying?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
That computer has everything...
Okay. 
You ready...?
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
Thomas Sandefur...
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What are you and Mike going to do?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Alright.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah.
Lowell.
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
What?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
Seven dwarfs?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
What's changed?
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
No.
No? No, what?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
Where are you, anyway?
What's happening?!
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
What are you talking about?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Seven...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
They hate each other --
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
That's his lawyer.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
You want Botox?
It was a gift from a client.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
It's your move, Miles.
What?
Is Tong older than Ming?
These are yours.
He wants a reconciliation.
What is it you're after, Miles?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
From a -- girlfriend.
Hmmm...
She never particularly cared for me.
She held that against you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No.
Huh?
Did you just propose to me?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Fabric and fringe.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
You can't prove anything.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Hello?
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
What?!
That's delusional.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Did Marylin end up with money?
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Nothing?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
What's Kirshner?
She always looked out for me.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
You're a peculiar chap.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
Do you love her?
Why don't you put me in chains?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Where are you taking me?
Nothing. 
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Why? Do you know him? 
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Huh?
I beg your pardon!
What happened?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Are you talking to me!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Where is the shower?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Detectives!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Next week "East Lynne."
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not as long as I'm alive.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Oh, Peter— 
I don't want it now.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Clever.
You might give me a little credit.
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Where's the bus to New York?
In about fifteen minutes.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
What's up?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Don't "Joe" me.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
You send telegrams here?
That's right.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Why—no—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Right.
There were no phone records.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Did he pay you for this?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Can you get some sworn statements?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
...Oswald?
No, I did not.
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
What was so appealing about Houston?
I see.  And where did you drive?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Who was paying you, Dave?
That's our case!
Are we going away, Daddy?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
A Willie O'Keefe?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
What?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Can we find her?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Yes.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...and your General?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Yes?
Yes.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
A bit.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
And you didn't tell the Police?
What's she want?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
It's kind of a sports bar
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
What have they told you?
Shit.
He's got that kinda money?
This is pretty.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
How'd you feel about it?
What'd ya see?
You talk them into it?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
What about you Max?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
We're partners.
Where're you going?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
I thought you were tired of your business?
How can you help us?
I'm recording this.
Uh-huh.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Ever been tempted?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
What did you do after that?
So what happens now?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Sure.
You think I'm kidding?
For what?
Yeah?
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Did you ever go I one?
About five years ago.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
Lemme have the bag.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
Are you serious?
What do I do?
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
An employee I had to let go.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Where you shot her.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Yeah.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Beaumont worked for you.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
And where's Jackie?
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
You expect me to just walk in there?
It's the next street.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Well, how do I look?
How do you know?
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Maybe the demons are real.
I'm hanging up.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
He say what they looked like?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
What can I tell you?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
She hates me, Louis.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I moved the couch. That's all.
Your kid dropped it off.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Lemme see.
Ready?
Jake!
What's wrong?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Why? What for?
Help me! Help me!
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
While you were in the shower.
I want to know. You tell me!
Are you out of your mind?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Then don't bug me.
Don't be funny.
This isn't happening.
Goddamn you!
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
One drop?
I think I'm falling asleep.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
He's burning up.
He'll never make it.
I'm awake?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Count 'em on one hand.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
That black car?
Why not?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
He's not part of the program.
Okay, enough of this shit.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Goodbye old friend.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Jesus, God!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
What if you miss?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
Rizzo, you okay?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
That's really funny.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I...I don't know what I did...
You lost the charge?
I'm gonna spew.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
You killed him?
I didn't say I was good at it.
Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
I missed you too.
We're missing two of the kids!
What?!!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
You're not going anywhere.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Can we get through these?
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
What about us?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Older, sillier.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
What's that?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
What happened?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
And nobody else saw her in the water?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Twenty years.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
I'm supposed to be running.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
So that's cool with you, then?
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Oh, God...
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
I'm a junior.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Hello?
Cool.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
You're pregnant?
What?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Dad, no!
I sort of already have.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
You're not listening to me.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Touche.
Keith's hot.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
A hotel?
Adele for god sake please lis...
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I'm cool.
Hold still.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Happy birthday Adele.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What the hell is this stuff?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Can't hurt.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Why?
A book on the warehouse murders?
Carrie.
What are you going to do?
Where's Adele?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Early, just think...
You were plenty hot.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Well, how was it?
What?
Right.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Darcy?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
How much you gonna take?
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Nah.
Casper.
Casper, where's Telly.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Yeah. Come on.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Come on.
How do you know?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
What?
Come dance.
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
The pain. The fucking pain!
I know.
You didn't?
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Mine?
Who, Benny's little sister?
And you don't get shit out of it.
Four-thirty in the morning?
You want a wip-it?
Right.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
What do you want?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
We'll find the evidence.
To get your attention.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Hello?
You know her?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
What word did you leave last night?
Please... wait.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He was watching you.
What are you doing up?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
It isn't Kathy.
Anything?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Where were you last night?
Just thought you might want to talk.
How come you don't stay with them?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
That's a very personal question.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Let's change the subject.
Doesn't that scare you?
I just don't want to fight with you.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I'm hungry.
Nothing.
For emphasis?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Peter...
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You don't understand.
Why not?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
Colwyn ...
I don't know how.
They have Lyssa!
You will go alone.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
What do you see?
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
Slayers!
They can be saddled.
Yes.
Let me comfort you.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
You will follow me.
We must try to get horses.
Go, join them.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Where are you going?
A small house.
Quell?
I'd wish for a puppy.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
A fine match.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Of what?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
No, no.
Take...
130... 140...
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Wow! It's brilliant!
OK.
The yellow and pink.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Not taken.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
I don't know... Five minutes.
Huh?
Messina.
...Who sent you?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Yes... Twice.
No...
This smells good.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
What?
I have to finish first.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
Can it kill me?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Yes?
It's a special day isn't it?
The new store?
There's no reason.
I've changed my mind.
Where?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
That's a reasonable assumption.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Not our problem.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Making the grand total?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Hello.
Hello!
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
What do you mean?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
What do you mean?
I don't understand any of that.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
I like it here with you.
Will you lighten up, please?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Don't hit me.
But it's a top three school --
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Are we done for today?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
That's not what's important.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Was she carrying a weapon?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
I don't know.
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
Our group is full.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Too demure?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Why?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Whoa -- Why?
Oh, my God!
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
You should. Do you have a resume?
It's pink.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
You're beautiful.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
I completely agree.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
No.
East coast people are different.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Why so few?
We come watch... we come watch...
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Why have you brought me here?
Or looked so beautiful...
No, wait... please... listen...
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Gump, is it?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
What!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Are we here?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
By the grace of God.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Worse than the battlefield.
Certainly understandable.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
There aren't enough arrows.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Mean you to seek him out below?
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Can't we move any faster?
You see!  You see!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
What shall we do?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
How much longer?
Jack!
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
What?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Dead, dead, dead.
That was in jest.
I'm promised to another!
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Up ahead!
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Marco!
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
When does George get to come see his house?
What color?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
Why?  What do you mean?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
He seems lonely.
Why?
I'm living here while I build another house.
What's today?
Did you feel anything?
My mother would die.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
You should stay.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I can use your mom's.
Really?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
I don't want you to!
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
A sink?
Pardon me?
How's your wife?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Maybe that's too long.
Maybe...?
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
For everything.
Well, it's the least I can do.
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
No.
I don't know.
Did you got through my pants?
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
That's not true.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Left you this place.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
God, you look like crap, George.
You should lock your doors.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
I was parked in day parking.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
I want him with me.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I used to live here.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Oh...with his ear infection!
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
He said he heard hammering.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
To shave your chest?
I'm helping George build his house.
What are you doing home?
You never really trusted me.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Can you stay for dinner?
Yeah.
Why?
Dad's home, already?
A night in the hole?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Then what's the problem?
Take care of me?
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
No, tell me what's so funny.
A loan officer?
That's right, a loan officer.
Like this?
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Alright. You want some pie?
Guess we better get going, huh?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
What?!
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
What'd you say?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
All in, boss!
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
I can't take that, mama.
Who?
What are you in for, Willie?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Understood.
Let her go.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
It's Stanley, sir.
What was it called, sir.
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
By she, do you mean he?
There's our man.
What's with that guy?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
You sure you're down with this?
Which way did he go?
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
If you want to.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
School?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What are you doing?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Don't do it.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
I don't know.
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Why?
You missed something special.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
I'm fine...  See you...
Where do you live, Mary?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
You felt sad. What's your name?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Curious.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
A Runner gave it to me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I wish I could help you.
Some people say children need human mothering.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I -- I can't.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Don't ever let go.
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Is it inside the city?
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
I'll make the arrangements.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
You okay, man?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Very strange.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
As best we can.
You know what I think?
Hello.
So what do we do?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Sit down a minute.
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
We saw you that night, Pete.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
No, sir, it's not.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Who is this man?
There's no other bedroom?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Something wrong?
What's bothering you, Madison?
Where's Alice?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
What's that?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
Where would you feel safe?
They're gonna cook him.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
You like pornos?
What?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
You still care about me?
I don't know.
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila... Stop...
Two years!?
Fossils.
I'm a paleontologist.
A paleontologist.
Uh-huh.
I beg your pardon.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
That's ridiculous.
Where are they? Do you see them?
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Certainly not.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Very often.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Yes.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
As far away as I ever want to be.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Yes.
You're lying, aren't you?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Nothing about the porters yet?
George, what do you think you're doing?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
was saying—
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
You do?
I wasn't scared...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
What's going on, Kay?
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus...
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
You were saying?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
You figured what?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Nowhere.
Yeah, Kay?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
Which way?
How's Dee?
Kay?  What's your 20?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Yeah?  What's up?
How'd you know?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
Where are we going?
I have to go back.
Who wanted her little girl back?
She died?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Because I found out about her...
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
That's not much.
It's all I could safely move.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Sir?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
To them.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
You're alive?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you...
Do you know who I am?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
What's so funny?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
-- and then walk out.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
What?
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Can't they shut that off?
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
He looks familiar.
Howard --
Cream and sugar.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
But John was with him at the pool?
I haven't seen him in two years.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
We have snifters
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
Yes, sir.
What, sir?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Oh no. What is it this time.
No.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Who's watching the baby?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Ho's a good guy --
Max offered to stake me.
Whu --
Get your hands off of her.
Get away from her.
What's that?
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
No.
Heard of them.
This is it.
This one?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
So, that's it. I'm out?
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
You told him you liked him.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Yes.
What is it?
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Where's the drop?
It's important.
So?
Don't be shitty.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
What's the movie?
C'mon, man...
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
What are you doing?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
How'd they know who you were?
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Like I said, I don't know.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Calm down.
It's gonna be fine.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
I want to leave right now.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Cardiff Giant?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Yes?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Yes?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
How do you know it's not drugs?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Yeah.
Nah, man...
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
So you're our own private guy?
No. What is it?
Sure. You boys want anything?
Yes. You're going to New York.
Tell me.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Yes, sir.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
I'll get it.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Keeps me out of the army.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
How's it feel?
I'm working on it.
Daddy, where's my money?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Who the hell are you?
Man, what do you want?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Elijah who?
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
What?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Why do you ask?
I know.
Yes. Did you eat?
What do you think?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
We need you too!
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Brother Earl.
You put it very well.
You know that gal?
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
500.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
What does Sidney say?
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
So what do I get in return?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
I show, you give me the information?
[What is his name?]
[No!]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Who are you?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[I want you.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Lucky how?]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
I'm here.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
So how's business?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
You did something on impulse?
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Why not?
No.
Well, I let him go.
It hurts.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Where's my mother?
You don't drink like you used to.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Creasy... Wait.
For a year?
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Two tourists who never went home.
You helped him get this job.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Hey, Herbie...
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
It's her baby too, you know.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yes, I know.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Yes, I know.
Nothing.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
You say something?
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
You gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hiya, Ralph...
Hello, Ralph.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Never this close.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Us. Lead us not into...
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
I was just asking...
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
I don't feel anything.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
What's going on? Who started this?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Can you make out what they're talking about?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Are you all right?
Action?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Did you write this?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Oh!
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
That's good.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
The letter.
The letter from John Doe.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Who, for instance?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Okay, fellows.
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
I used to pitch.
Baseball?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
A what?
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
What's your name?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Yes! I was paid! But the—
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
That's too bad.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
What?
They're not usually graduate students.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
What happened, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Am I gettin' the car?
Who are you again?
You signed out twice.
...a car.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Is that all?
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
Only at the very end.
I've rarely shot anyone.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Recruited you from where?
You'd never been out of New York?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why did he do it?
That's okay. That's his style.
He's cutting down the visibility.
What the fuck is going on.
So what do you want to do?
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You think I didn't need you?
It's already started.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
How's Paco doing?
Hmm?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
...the hell are you talking about?
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
The car is part of the deal.
I want to be put on this case.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it!
Why?
Because I took it out of your memory.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
No.
Where the hell are you going?
It's his nature.
The woman you're stuck on.
He had access to the keys --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Who did he digitize?
Then where is she?
Cleaning up a mess.
And it meant something.
Because you'll never believe me.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
I can hardly walk...
What's a Triac?
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Let's go after him!!
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
What!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Poor, yeah.
So what happened?
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Four-twenty-eight.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Inside, they were talking of you.
I'm already late.
So you all make the same mistakes?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like a party for all our friends.
Who?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
But that's an hour's drive.
The kid just called me stupid.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And how many soldiers do you have?
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Anything!
You're fuckin' crazy.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Stu...LOOK!
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What pictures?
He seemed quite taken with you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Who is it?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Where to?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You've never *seen* this contract.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
You play--left field.
Yeah. What about the second act?
Yeah.
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
How about getting married?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Is the wind tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Huh?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Why me?
Diz!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Dinner, Hubert.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Otis!
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Look! There it is!
Mr. President!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
For one week!
I yield.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Y-yes.
Yield *how*, sir?
For a *question*.
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Please, sir!--come with me!
Yes, Ma?
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Can't you?
What is it?
Did you say--bus?
There *what* was?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Punch?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Right.
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Try sitting down.
I know. It's--Violet.
In Terry Canyon?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Oh--Saunders--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Yay!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Sure.
Oh--you are!
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
That's--that's splendid.
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Yes--
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
That's going to be fun.
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
No.
What did they say?
That depends on what they see.
Yeah, I know.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
A girl?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
The guy's balmy.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Can I have a month's vacation?
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Last night he proposed to me.
What're you going to do?
That's the rub.
You try it.
Is that the best you've got?
He's not home, I tell you!
Your Honor, I object.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Yes?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Are your parents living?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
What for?
No?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
No, thanks.
Huh?
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Why not?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
No?
What's that?
It's a thought I had.
I've had my moments.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
Yeah.
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
You like me. How come?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Sure I can, Lionel.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Sure.
What's wrong with her?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
I think you do.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
Please... forgive me.
Be specific.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yes.
Disgusting.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Is it something you've heard about me?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Um-huh.
Transference!
Transference.
Hello?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Uh-huh.
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It's not?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
At least you pulled yourself out...
That'd be Lily.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
What about it?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Sorry...
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And what ritual would that be?
Altar boys?
C'mon, friend.
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And what is he in prison for?
Fifty percent.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
No?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
We're almost there.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
Something like that.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
It's everybody's problem!
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
I found it, Evy! I found it
That thing gives me the creeps.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I know you did.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
Where are you going?
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Who are you?
Me, too.
It's me... Elizabeth.
I got it.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Why?
Me, too.
Bye. 
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
We had an off night, that's all.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
But there's still only six of us.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Sounds good.
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
So what can I get you?
It's on the television.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
That was too close.
Oh no.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Fair enough.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Yes, sir, I am.
When did it start?
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
What is that?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
No... nothing at all.
Are you trying to insult me?
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
And now?
Yes.
Promise me.
Promises mean nothing.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
What are you doing in there?
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
There's probably some explanation.
Certainly.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
I couldn't face telling you.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Oh, then you are...
No.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
And where do you place Alexander?
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Yes, sir.
Come in.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Why you say that?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Stretch it out.
Great moves, Day-Day.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
You straight?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
That's the sister.
So.
What you mean, so?
You know what this is?
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
What we gonna do?
I hope to God that dog is happy.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
What's the matter?
What it smell like?
You see that?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Thanks for the help.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Debo!  Debo!
Ezal!  Ezal!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
What you doing to my nephew?
Elroy, what happen?
Business or pleasure?
San Diego.
I need your help.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
Ah.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Can we go now?
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
What about the gun?
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
How am I supposed to get away?
Let me talk to her again.
I want'to talk to her.
No way.
Ready?
No...kisses to you.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Please...
That's right.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
You're going to go see her.
What am I supposed to say to her?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Laughs.
I'm not a baby.
Get moving.
Foreigners! Fuck!
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
He never told about the money.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Don't!
Yes! Yes!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
What can we do, Mother?
Pearl dotes on him.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You go set down by the River.
Amen.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Pearl! You ain't --
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Don't you hurt her!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Huh?
It -- she --
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
What's your name?
O no! Your turn!
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Are you through praying?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids!
Pearl and John!
I been bad!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
He never asked me for nothin'.
What?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Worked like a charm.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
Yeah.
Much better.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
You used me, daddy!
Nan, I --
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Right home after.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
You okay?
Go even crazier?
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Aren't you late?
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
Well, a hat...
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
You want this?
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Monsieur.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
The former Duchess!
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Yes, monsieur?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
But you had!
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
What?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Please don't misunderstand me...
And what do you do for mankind?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Glorious, analytical...
The telephone is ringing.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
On which boat?
Do you like Scotch stories?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
I wish they had never met.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Go on.
Shhh! Shhh!
No! No!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Radio! What is radio?
But I can throw it out of the window.
They belong to the people.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Make it ice cold.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
She's gone, Leon.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I don't understand.
Your Highness.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Where the hell is he?
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yes ... I got the money.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
No, sir.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
There's no secrets here, Al.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
The army?
I don't know anything about that.
Sir?
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Well, why not?
All right.
Just do what I say, Bob.
Sir?
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Jesus!
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Sir?
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What'd he say?
What'd you say?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
I always get my man.
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Mein Kampf?
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Did you cry when he died?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
The lie?
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
Where you from?
Syracuse.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
POWs.  And their families.
Proud?
Yes, yes.
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
Amen to that.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Can I just ask for one thing?
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
When did he die?
Nineteen zero and nine.
You're discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Would you tell me if you had?
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
We goin' in?
No sir.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I never do.
I don't know. Had dreams.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Llewelyn?
Hey.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Yes I did.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
Mm-hm.
...You getting anything on this?
Airport.
...You need to talk to me.
All right.
How much?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Will there be anything else?
Sir?
Yes.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Tent poles.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Well enough.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
What else then?
...What do you do?
I'm a welder.
Yes.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
Are you in the service?
Nam?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
We think we know where Betty is.
That's a nice name for what you need...
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
You must be joking.
Do you know why I'm here?
I'd rather not...
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
The LeSabre!
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
George...
Thanks...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
I came for love...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
You're in serious danger!
I'd slap his face.
Did you love it?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
No. Loma Vista.
Dr. David Ravell.
I'll go to the Hospital.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
What? Where was he?!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Huh?
What do you mean?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
I didn't. You gave me a look!
What 'look'?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I hope you're right...
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
It just didn't fit her profile...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
...and how long did she work here?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
I said I'll think about it.
Better.
Did Chloe crack?
Yeah?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Devil his due.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Where's your ring, honey?
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
It was a moment a weakness!
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Come back here, kid!
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Why?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
What's your name, boy?
I want your D.O.R.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
I want to fly jets, sir!
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
You're sure it's okay?
I'm a little late, that's all.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
You got a girl?
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I'm looking for Sid.
That's brilliant.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
No problem, but who's Susan?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
You should see the look on your face.
What?  What do you want me to do?
Th --
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
NOT THAT ONE?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Yeah, whatever.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Nobody leaves.
The crowd goes wild.
That room!
What if they get in here?
Feel okay?
Shaky?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Small space?
YOU HAVE TO!
No.
Call Dad!
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
What if I spazz out?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Can you make a deal with them?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
C'mon let's...
So talk...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Yeah.
Just a kid.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
We'll all get out of here together.
This cool the heat off you any?
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
When?
I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
You look well, Charlotte.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Do you?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Thank you.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Perhaps.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
What news?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
These four wagons must be his.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Don't go in there.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Worse.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Well...I guess not.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Please hurry.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Yeah, sure.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
I don't know.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
But--
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
This was their burying ground, Louis.
What are those for?
But--
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
That's forgotten.
Louis, are you sure?
What's in your head, boy?
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Did he speak?
You're speaking up for him again?
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
Raise the sails.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
How?  The key's run off.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
He's still breathing.
Commodore --
A moment.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
What are you going to do?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Daniel...
You're insane.
Look at this!
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Did you go?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
I remember I was trying to help...
You!  I remember you!
And you have him?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
I think I better go, Stew.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
For what?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
Oh, Mother!
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
I poisoned him.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
What is this person doing here?
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yeah!
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Yeah?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Yeah - go on.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah, little Gloria.
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
Araby?
I'm not quitting!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Yes.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
—and that—
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Not since you broke into society.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Sorry, boss—
I think you'd better go.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Surely, come right in.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Sure.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
You try it.
Found no skeletons?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
I just putter.
That's puttering, sir.
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.
Thank you.
I won't.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
Like a drum.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
But where would we go?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
She won't go out with me?
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
"Changes."
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Hello Bud.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
JENNIFER!
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Nothing.
... Yeah.
Can I ask you a question?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
So what's it like?
What?
What do we do?
Where are they?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Just gimme the damn remote!
Do you have the lettuce?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yeah ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Just listen to me ...
Hi.
It's an art book.
Yeah. TV busted?
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
This is Barry.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Hi, is this Jack?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
It doesn't matter.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Yeah.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....yeah....
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Did you pick it up from the street?
...yes I did...?
Hi.
That was good.
I don't freak out very often.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Yes.
I just wanted to make sure.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
I think maybe over a hundred.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
It's a plastic, yeah.
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
I cut myself.
I know.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
337.....I'm sorry....
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
....now: this pudding?
Where you been?
Hey.
Wait a minute --
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late though.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Are you sure?
So...did my brother call you?
I'm sorry. You're right.
Should I call you later?
Has he hurt you?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
Mustn't do that, sir.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
They can't be serious.
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
I saw the longing in your eye --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Go to hell!
Abbe de Coulmier!
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
I have.
Of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
He'll do no such thing.
As you say, Doctor.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
Quite.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
There's something else I want from you.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Sure
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
So I've been told.
There's a different between want and
You are repellant when you drink.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Yes?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Sir, I-
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
No -- no -- I mean--
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Can I talk to Hearst?
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
The great Spanish bullfighter
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Oh Christ...
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
I expected more from you.
Sorry to disappoint.
Don't do this
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Don't do this
He'll destroy us.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
The title?
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Yes
Pardon?
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
For Christ's sake, shut up--
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
I think you better sit down
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
I know what you want but it can't be done!
He's Christ?
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
We're from...
They wanna talk to you.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
This looks done.
What's wrong?
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Go 'head.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
With her? How?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
I did keep an eye...
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
What do you mean, "you"?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Who asked you?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
You asleep?
That he's got a pretty face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
What'd you see?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What're you talking about?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
What?
Why don't you just call him up?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I said, let's go.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is the baby sitter.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
A detective's nightmare.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Your Lisa?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Like what?
Like an old hambone?
For getting rid of that cast.
This is Wednesday.
You did.
With that cast on -- you don't.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Hello.
Something wrong?
Who are you?
I predicted it.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
What about this morning? Any developments?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What are you two talking about?
Ten here.
Anything else bothering you?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Nothing, thank heaven.
There's nothing to see.
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Yeah.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Is he cleaning house?
Well?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Chelsea 2-5598.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What's happening?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
No--
You make any sandwiches?
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
What would you do, Dad?
We don't have time.
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
What?
It's me!
Plato!
What's that got to do with it?
No.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
If he could--
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Plato!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
It doesn't matter to them.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
It is for me too.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, you promised!
Toys for... adults?
I don't think it's negative five.
No, c'mon --
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
Well, I don't know about that --
We could live it up and --
...the truck driver...
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Nick, I love you --
Gabriel!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
No!
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
That guy knows you?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Yes!
So you could get with my sister.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Samantha.
What college.
Be more specific.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
At least gimme video poker.
Do I get a country-western name?
No.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
Take 'em.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Fuckin' freezing.
Five years. Since it opened.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Haven't thought about it.
She's using a new perfume.
What, working security?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Pam Grier.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Who's your parole officer?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Like hell I am.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Don't ask me that.
You do?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You didn't ask.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
It's not good...
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Dead.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
I'm cool.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Who shot who?
Look of things, she doesn't.
What's the matter with her?
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Maybe it's better that way.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
What was he in jail for?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Finished, son?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
You know what she asked me?
I don't care what she asked you.
You'll live.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
What's the matter -- restless?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
I tried my best, but these things take time.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Everybody knows --
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
That's the end of the line.
Hey, Brenda.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Ray, run faster.
No. I never date outside my race.
Yeah.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
What about you, Buddy?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
Oh.
Hey, look out, a bee!
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Stop touching his brain!
It was you...
This can't be happening?
Father!
My child, you're alive!
You could use the grade, huh?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I finished all the interviews.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
You do.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mrs. Sutphin?
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Sorry, ma'am.
In here, Mom...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Goodnight, honey.
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
So you do drink?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
It's sugarless.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
You know who I am, August?
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Can we go there now?
I don't like this.
Yes.
Yes.
Why, Mary --
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I did her hair.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
I don't think that's so revealing.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
What was she to you?
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me what?
Perhaps.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I'm very, very serious.
I'm afraid not.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Graham is an unusual name.
No, not really.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Nine years.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Do you want me to?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
So you don't believe in therapy?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Maybe you want to go.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Do you talk to him?
Sometimes. Afterward.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
And now you can?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I don't know.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I can't tell you like this.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
John?
Well, are you?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
What do you mean?
God, no.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Is he still at your house?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Do you have to say that?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I can't believe you did that!!
So what's my share of the dress?
Thank you.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
She didn't give you my address?
Do I sit or stand?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I would.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I'm intrigued.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Did he put you up to this?
I know. Will you please leave now?
You were prying before?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Jesus!
Yes.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Another kiss?
OK. But late.
Where is he now? Do you know?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
So who changes?
Huh?
I got it!  I got it!!!
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
I know, I know, it's just...
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
We're the experts.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
I'll leave you young things to it.
That's us.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Poor Brad.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
Farley!
F for...
CRIMINAL
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I love you.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Are you there? Miles?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
I can't help the traffic.
You said you had it all lined up.
Oh, that's tasty.
Just tell me.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
How old's she going to be?
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
How would you rate this one?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Then it's a good thing.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
What do you think?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Aye-aye, captain.
Shut up. Shut your face.
I will.  See ya!
Hey, there you are.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's that supposed to mean?
Thanks.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Well?
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
So what's the plan?
Me?
No, I'm okay.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
Is she sleeping or...?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Yeah. Thanks.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Only for pee or poop.
No.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
My ballet recital.
I see.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Five. The five longest.
I'm not going to curse.
Just make noises then.
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
This is going to do nothing.
What are you doing?
Me too.
How many died?
These are D's; I need double A's.
Dad.
What about Isabelle?
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
What's that?
Okay.  So he was tall?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Forget it.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Kate?
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
South of here, past Chimayo.
What's Turley like?
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What are you talking about?
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I heard that too.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
What is it you want from me?
What's this?
What do you mean?
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
-- I can explain.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Not quite.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
Well, I --
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
... so much like her?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Who are you really?
No, I'm okay.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
You never were together, Hal.
Why not?
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You saw that?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Really?  Too bad.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I love you, Lainey.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
Nice boat, Taransky.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
What if it catches on fire?
The only real truth is in the work.
I forgot your name.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
Dr. Crowe.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
A lady. She died.
Cole, you're scaring me.
...I don't know.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
S-ssstop that!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
...He doesn't get invited places.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Hi.
Suzie???
Dammit, Carl!!!!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Should we be doing this, dude?
Harvest moonshining!
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Throw me one.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
No Mac, please... I --
Like what?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
What?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
My present?
I'll get if for you.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Where'd he go?
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
How much style?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
See ya, Kate.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
And?
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
No what?
Order up!
Cledus.
See.
He's history.
Bandit?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
I hate to say it...
We're outta motion lotion.
You okay?
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
I think you're just yellow.
This is Bandit I. Over.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
He's giving them up?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
...I forgive you Darwin.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
You woulda?
Yeah, we've been through that.
No, what did you say on the machine?
Do you want me to say I did it?
...When did you know all this?
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
Yeah... Sid?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
What'd you say?
What's wrong?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
I can trust Rheya.
Listen --
That's fantastic.
You fucking bastard...
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
What will you say?
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Just get him to stop.
Her oxygen would have run out.
What are they?
We're taking a flight?
Rheya.  Not here.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What does Snow think you should do?
Who have you been talking to?
Can you sleep?
It's all right.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
I want to stop taking those pills.
When?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
No dog.
You could do better.
You put me life in danger.
Let go!
Not exactly.
You don't want to know.
Oh that thing in Queens.
When can I see you?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Claire...
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
How long you going away for?
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Keep what handy?
Your what...?
What are you talking about?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
So how'd it go?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Mike, take it easy...
What did you do tonight?
What did you watch?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
What about when she identifies him?!
At my house...!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Why should she come in?
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Watch your step!
What're we having?
How about dinner tonight?
Shooting.
Here you go, Pete.
No, no.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
I know.
Flash, drop it--
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Now tell me you love me.
Can't focus...
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Mr. Jameson--
Thanks, I already ate.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
Do you mind if I come too?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
A match made in heaven.
Aunt May, what happened?
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Where'd you get the clown suit?
You're sure you're all right.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become… whatever it is you are?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
What's wrong with him?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
You make my mouth water.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
What exactly is he charged with?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Shut up, Animal!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
What's the award?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
You did?
What do those broads say?
What do they always say?
Let me alone.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
We've all done a poor job of it.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
We did it.
You starting that again?
You told them, Hoffy.
You taking Dunbar?
You could use a new one yourself.
Yeah?
Give this to Joey, will you?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
I'll make it five hundred!
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
This is me in Cincinnati.
All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
Is it all right if we smell it?
It's working.
Target their Bridge.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Data, this isn't the time.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Yes, where would you go?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Antonia?
Yes.  Thank you.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
The Nexus.
Aye, sir.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Short range scan.
My readings indicate great instability.
What is it?
Logic indicates that is the case.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Did your collaborator know?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
How many more?
Just him, sir!
I know you... Do I not?
The word, sir?
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Would you look at that?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Yours...?!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
But -- why?
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Share this with no one.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
You amaze me, Commander.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Maybe...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
Why didn't you tell me?
How soon --
Steady on course. All systems normal.
Departing dark side, Regula.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
She's not responding...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
On screen.
Admiral --
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
I would not presume to debate you.
Gentlemen, this isn't --
Spock!
... the good of the few...
Kirk here.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
That was a little joke.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
How?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Time from my mark...
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Stop engines.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Fire all phasers...!
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
It doesn't look all that different.
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Can you isolate the wave?
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
Find it?
Like what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
I suppose they told you that...?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Wanna try it from the top?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
... What does that mean?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Yes?
I cannot tell a lie.
Exaggerate.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I meant --
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Spock: Condition report!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Two?
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
... Yes?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Just use the keyboard...
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Don't panic...
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Don't you ever get tired?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
I don't believe it happened that way.
... had regenerated.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Who is it?
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Why was Data assigned?
You haven't done that in a long time...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Augh?
All hands. Battle stations!
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
How long has he been unconscious?
Do you know what this is, Data?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Dispersive armor is holding.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Did you need something?
You're lying.
No. It's a lot further than that.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Yes, sir.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Good luck, Captain.
I believe the operation is over.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Are we playing multiple choice?
That cunning little Vulcan...
Are you carrying a surgeon?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
There... were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?
That isn't true...!
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Possibly.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Sir?
Who is "US?"
WE volunteered?
Never been this close.
We HAVEN'T fired -
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
What's she waiting for?
Direct hit -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Because you are dangerous.
For how long?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Beverly, come in.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
An individual more like you, you mean.
What purpose does this serve?
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Counselor.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
How could I not?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
Do you have life support?
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Sir?
Not with the Romulans.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
That will never happen.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Sir?
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Looking up at the stars.
Yes.
All of this so you could capture me?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Why are you here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And what of the Enterprise?
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
What about Picard?
He's a very unusual android.
Are we prepared?
Praetor...
They will obey, Praetor.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
But surely...
How much are your rooms?
No!!! No!!!
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
It's in a green Mustang?
Clarify that.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
George... Do you hear me, George?
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Pancakes.
Minneapolis.
No gas.
Are you from up there? Space?
No.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I will see it next time.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
What happened?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Put that back.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Where are you going?
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
But...
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
I will say that we can be friends.
There.
The yellow one.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
What's going on?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
I won't say anything.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I always do.
It's alright.  He means it.
Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Forget her.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
So that gives you something.
No more, Lenny.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Those two guys were cops.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Alright.  We're going up.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
This isn't in our database?
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
Another what?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
I'll take it into consideration.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I was looking for a pattern.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Don't you touch him.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
You got a point there.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Yes.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
You? You went by the book?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"MyDick?"
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Tell me about it...
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Charles! What's up, man?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Always...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
Why didn't you call?
So I don't call either way.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
It sucks.
I mean, I need the money.
What do you want? You're tall.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Oh no?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
What'd you get?
An eight.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
What's dumb about it?
What's he do?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Are you ready to order?
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
I don't know...
You're crazy.
Wake up, baby.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
What?!?
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Thanks for clarifying that.
What an asshole.
What an asshole.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
What was the part?
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
She didn't like me, anyway.
I don't think so.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
Tomorrow?
Is she looking now?
...we're not...
You're money.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
You dick.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
You take care of Paulie?
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
No.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
Barzini.
No.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Who are those girls?
We're all tired...
We should hear what they have to say.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Did he give you his politicians?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
Michael, what are those men doing?
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
What time do they expect us?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
What?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Buy me out?...
Uncanny!
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
It's just an undercoat. 
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
You like jazz!
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
And Rome.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
I know. I write like a child.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
Relax.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
That's good.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Oh God, I don't think so.
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Sure.
What are you doing?
Mr Greenleaf.
Far cry from New York.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
That ring's so great. The green one.
How long's he staying for?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie?
Where does Dickie live?
Look at me what?
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
So you found Peter...
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I know.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That's good, isn't it?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
I've been backpacking.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
It's okay.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Well that would be even better gossip.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Peter, I... I...
Yes?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You got a .44 Magnum?
Huh?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
I don't know...
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
What kind of people?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
What hours do you work?
I bought a couple of tickets.
But this is a porno movie.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
What about the record?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Try holding the match like this.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Huh?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your real name?
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Well, I tried.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Huh?
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
What's so important?
Do I look like a narc?
You don't have to.
Have you tried the telephone?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
There must be something...
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
I'm no cop.
I'm here to see Iris.
What's the action around?
Yeah?
Well, I just, you know...
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Had a close one.
Not really.
Could we change the subject?
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Maybe.  Not really.
I don't understand....
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Well, there's got to be a way...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Now, did you remember that, or...
What... do you remember?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
No wallet, huh?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
A few.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Can we get him to the hospital?
Huh?
I know.  A Purple Heart.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
It's wrong, Leo.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
That was beautiful.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Oh.
It's about me.
Yes.  Very.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Miss Hayworth?
It's a lovely garden.
Yes.
How do you like our little hamlet?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
She already has a daughter.
And the second?
Do you think I should go?
They haven't harmed anyone.
I don't think your mother would like that.
What?
Try my best.
It's a surprise, you see.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Young woman cut herself.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
Maybe we ought to leave.
They won't be.
If they are?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
What?
Aren't these lovebirds?
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
What are you? A policeman?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Yes.
Right next to the one you already had.
Why did he shoot her?
Without any clothes on?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
So you didn't go to school together.
I wrote the letter.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
Helping travelers.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
What?
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
No, I have my things in the car.
It's an uprising.
Melanie...
The bay doesn't.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Help how? What do you want to do?
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Birds?
I haven't finished my drink.
I'm Donald Fettes.
I fear he may have to.
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I'm cold as ice.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
He's not home.
Yes, I suppose so.
Well --
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
This is not a woman!
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
You think I'm crazy.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
You're him. Corvis.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
No! Why are you haunting me?
This tree. Here's where it happened.
My father.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's not. I can't take it.
Yeah, we do.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
They botched the execution.
Could say that.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Anything wrong?
You want me to walk a straight line?
Why are there so many?
What? What is it?
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Sweetheart...
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
I thought that was only for bombs.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
It was a wonderful day.
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I want to know what he told you last night.
What is it you want?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Where are you going now?
I -- I thought you were--
No. That's all finished.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
I don't like horror comics.
Can't stand light?
We don't ride with vampires.
Shut up!
Two down and two to go.
What?...
I will, David!
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
I like Michael.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Smells like something died.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Not impressed, are you?
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Something the matter?
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Why not?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Piss off.
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
How you doin', old boy?
What?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Torch it over there!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What do we do about those three?
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Thank you.
A couple of hours.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
No.
We're on fire!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
How long's it been?
He's dead.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Maybe it ain't coming.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
What?!
Now how did you get hurt?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
What kind of stories?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Morlocks --
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
The air... the power.
Why did they built it?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
I don't understand.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
As slaves.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And what of the Eloi?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
You know I can't.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Sorry... I was distracted.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
We took a walk three days ago.
Heavens, look at that now!
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I live with it every minute of every day.
Thank you...
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
This is magnificent...
Thank you.
Or mud carriers.
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
Mara --
I see.
No, sir --
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
I did...
What do you mean?!
We'll see about that.
What about Starks?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
That's too bad.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I gave you my dog tags.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Yeah.
[Beat] You bled to death.
Why?
I don't know.
Then, where are you going?
I've been ok.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
[Beat] I don't know.
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
How...how do you know?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
I wasn't talking about anything.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
Yup. That's me.
[Beat] I do it.
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Honey?
What?
Who do you think did it?
Good God.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Stop.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
What did ya do?
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Can't it go to any office?
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Who is it?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Why now, Jimmy?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
You're not touchin' that car.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Why not?!
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Louise?  Where are we?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
I can see that.
What?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
How far are we from Mexico?
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Hi there!  You alright?
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Well why don't you look her up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
What's so funny?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Hm?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
We're in love with your roommate.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
That...? Vestibule.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
A fucking moron.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Mary ah, forget it.
Urrggghh...
No, not at all.
Three different guys?
Oh my.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Harvard?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
You know, I really should take your card.
How many is that?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Hm?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
I can live with those reflections.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Meaning?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Oh, are you on the team?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Trying to be.
Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Shhhhhh!
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
No! I was pissing!
How are you doing, Warren?
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
Starshells.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
I'll do it.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
And?
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Max.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
When are you going to be home?
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Rug samples.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Jesus...
You crashed my file?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Couldn't sleep.
Her oil pan is shot.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Jesus, you alright?
Bullshit.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He said he doesn't know.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Cuz you're a cop.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Jesus. Oil?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
He's gone.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
Thank you.
X21, give me a 20.
X21. Come back.
What ya want?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
I can't.
Lieutenant...
The what?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What plane.
Let's make it at eight.
Why'd you do that?
No!
It's not suffering anymore.
You're totally insane.
Where?
Where are we?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You don't have to do this.
That's what I want.
Hardly ever.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
What?  What is it?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
That's not what I heard.
You think you can stay up with us.
Great move. Great
It's a victory roll.
Come on, relax...
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
What'd you do?
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
I guess I owe you one.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
I've seen this before.
You won?!!!
Yes sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Then why are you here?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
What happened to them?
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
How'd you find me?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Do you expect me to believe you?
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
I am Quaid.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
But I thought...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
So, been married long?
Your sexual orientation?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Suppose I do...then what?
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Yeah.
What, aliens?
Oh, Rekall.
I want that fucker dead.
Nobody.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
...You mean it?
Let's do it.
And you believe him?
What are you doing?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Go on.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
She wasn't really my wife.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Now what?
I used to model for 'em, why?
What reactor?!
Or a big mother slug maybe?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You're really leaving, huh?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Fuck you!
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Like hell you are.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Twenty.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Think it's still following us?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
True.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
You can't remember that -- !
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Of course.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Ten years is a long time.
Chinatown street gang.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
...What do you mean?
But what?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I embellished.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
No. You tell me, Shu.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Shu Kai Kim.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I don't think I know that name.
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Soldado.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
The phone company was broken up.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Blonde.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
I'm nearly out.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Did she have someone with her?
Was there an argument?
Yes...
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
That would indicate that it's the future.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
No.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
What happened to her?
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
I see. He does talk loud.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Agent Desmond, it's...
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
Faulty wiring.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Laura, I am your friend.
WE got it back, that's all.
I am The Muffin.
Right on time, baby.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Why? It does.
It does matter. We're in love.
I can't tonight.
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Josie, I think we should go public.
Fish eyes?
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Can I take the car?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Fine.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Dad?
Leland...
Did you get this from your lover?
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
How good's your intelligence?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Anything special about the case?
It's all right, Mickey.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I read the hospital report on your client.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Do you know who her doctors were?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Yes...
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Are you done?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Is this a bad time.
I've got to work...
Yes.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
Is it over?
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Yes. Yes, I have.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Uh...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...I'm going to need your help...
I'm going to help her.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Admittance form is wrong.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Are you with me... are you awake...?
The broad has disappeared...
Dr. Towler...
Yes, that's correct.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Should I?
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
There's nobody left around here now.
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Is that... machine...?
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
It was...  ...one of them!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
No.  I thought you had them.
Right.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
They don't do much of anything...!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
What?
I don't follow.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Like Freddy.
I'll be there in three hours.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Time for sleep.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
You okay?
When do you think it'll be done?
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Heather, what is it?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
What?
You may not like what you hear.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
I didn't know sir.
Come in.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Why didn't you drop any sail?
What do you mean?
Where's Mom?
What do you mean?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Ninety-six.
Figured what out?
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Sorry to here it.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Jesus.
Do what?
Ya know... "It".
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
What's your problem?
Why'd you jump?
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
Trust me donut.  I know.
I don't.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
Suicidal...
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
I'm not gonna kill it.
What?
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
... Absolutely not.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Yessir.
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
What's the name of it?
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
What is it, Johnnie?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
You up for that?
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
They sure do stink.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
What's that, peanut?
What's that?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
He's the kind liked it.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Yes... Get rid of him.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Where?
Yes.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
No.
So?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I know... I remember.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Your wife.
I just mean...
He has a book.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
You stay there.
Kidnapped? By who?
Which is?
So sensitive.
Shut up, James.
So what's the problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Find the jacket.
In a sense.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
You driving this car?
It's mine.
Sure.
Hello?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
They're glass. The buttons.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Can I ask you something about her?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Who?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
What kind of dancer?
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
How can you tell?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
You're lying.
The hell I am.
I didn't mean it that way.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I think so... What about you?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Hm.
Well...
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
I heard.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Who's this ?
It's Grady, Walter.
I... I...
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
No, the dog.
George Sanders?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
Annette? She's good... tense.
Is it because of Anna?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
It wasn't like that.
Then what? What?!
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
You should hear the bird.
See anything interesting?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
What's up?
Little Red Riding Hood.
What?
And your new apartment?
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
Why's that?
Robin?
But will he... ?
I don't mind.
Can't I stay a little longer?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
A diary?
You don't like coming here, do you?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I mean, when will I be normal.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Sorry.
That's not a helpful answer.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
What else?
Time.
What picture?
You must hate it.
What about bears?
Something happened to you.
Why do you want to know?
Maybe later.
The worst?
Sorry.
How young?
What?
I'm sorry, Walter.
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
Just think about it.
I've got problems.
What's your fucking problem?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Lord Almighty.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Wasn't up to me.
You wanna know what I think?
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Fine.  Be that way.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
Jesus, Lindsey--
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
I think it likes you.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
We'll go in through that large breach.
God, I hate that bitch.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Got it. Over.
Is that it?  Is this right?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Uh, oh...
Then how come you're not with him?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
That must be Basiluzzo.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, you should go.
Any news?
What is it, Claudia?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
What are you saying?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
I love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
But where did you finally end up?
What happened?
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
You men are all so dreadful!
Giulia...
Don't you ever paint men?
Yes, sir. Three times.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Whose boat is that?
And how come you're up so early?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
You know, I don't love anybody.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
I would like to ask you something.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Is that far from here?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
He talked to you Himself?
Why?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
No I don't... the host is enough.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
No I don't.
Let's talk about something else.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Yes.
Oh, I know he does.
Yes.
Did it hurt?
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Are you married?
Would you like some?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
How did she know that?
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
I could never be a mother.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
What did you do?
No...
You can tell me.
She's dead isn't she?
Because I'm in trouble.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Yes.
Hm hmm.
Who?
What else?
Which one?
She'd seen him too.
So she sent you?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
I don't know.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
I'll have it.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
None as far as I know.
Could there have been anyone else?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
So, someone else could have done it.
Who?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
You hate us don't you?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
What is it?
When was that?
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit yourself!
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
Do you want to become one?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For Agnes.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Too late for what?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Eh?
Yeah.
You don't think...
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I beg your pardon?
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
That's not your Grandfather.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Ringo!
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Sorry.
I see.  Do you like the play?
I'm not ...
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Yes.
Ah.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Out where?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Like what?
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
We were going to do it.
You wouldn't!
What?
My eyes are lighter.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Is it? Is it really?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
He belongs to Paul.
Look after him.
Who?
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
How's that?
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
I'll set John on you!
Is that you, Roby?
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Hell, we're equipped --
Locked.
Can you get it a little closer?
Gravity?
What's the terrain down there?
Close enough to walk to!
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Computer, what language was that?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Yeah!
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Oh -- God -- oh --
It's clear.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
What do you mean?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
No.
What do you mean, no?
Oh no.
Blow the ship up?
We can use the flamethrower.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
There, it caught!
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
I thought I'd find you here.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Yeah, okay. 
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Martin, uh, we've found it.
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Oh well... you know me.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
I'll get you out of there.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Thanks.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
And?
Shit.  When?
You win some, you loose some.
What?
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Okay.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
They've changed their heading again.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Think I spoke too soon...
You should hit the sack, too.
Hello, there. Who are you?
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
Eddie...
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Just like it.
Paved with what, then?
Almost four.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Why'd call me a killer?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
I didn't mean just the Theater.
... and Karen.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
What do you mean by that?
No-no-no...
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
I don't think I'm going.
Because I don't want to.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
We have that in common.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Bill!
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
What?
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
The kid. Junior.
Don't mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
I'm trying terribly hard.
I've been aware of that for some time.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
With the paper to prove it.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Is that what you want me to be?
You hear all kinds of things.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Birdie-
You don't like Eve, do you?
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I'll never get over it.
I wish I could believe that.
I think I know...
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Not at all...
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
If you'd like.
Roughly ten minutes.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Do you want it on?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
That's on time for Margo.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
How do you mean?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I'm sure.
That depends.
What's your being married got to do with it?
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Call, what call?
"Liebestraum."
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
That was fun.  What now?
Sure.
Who'd you vote for?
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Hmm?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
You've really got to go.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
No games, Irwin; give.
--I saw him. He verifies.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
How grand?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
It is.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
You can't believe that.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
That was awhile ago.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Go on.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Sorry, coach.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Me too.  For the most part.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
So you're going to Michigan?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
What about the game?!
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Of course.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
You're so big!
You can send me the address too.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Who cares?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
What's up, fellas?
Uh...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
But you don't love me.
I don't know.  How do you?
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Bullshit.  From where?
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Really?
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Salots! Shitfucker!
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Don't you want to change?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
The ADM. Let's go.
Nothing's happening!
Psychic awareness. Right.
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Uncle Terrence?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Claude.
Why would he pick this one?
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
I shant!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
Come on up!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
What a beautiful ship!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Don't let me go!
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
What?
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
I cursed then all!
What was that?
What do you mean?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
You're like New York. You're an island.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
How can you possibly oversleep?
Oh!
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
You-you play... very well.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Uh, you're driving a-
All right.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Oh, sorry.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Really?
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Uh-uh-why?
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
Who cares? Who cares?
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Yeah.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
What's- It's me, open up.
Yeah.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Check it out.
Remember, we had that thing.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
God, it's so clean out here.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Oh, good. Okay.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Oh, I'm sorry!
What-
Bad?
Where are you going?
You have a raccoon?
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
You like this house, Max?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Yeah. Right.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
But she's colored.
They're persecuted enough!
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
...of possibly working together.
Would it make a difference?
Absolutely.
What's that?
What?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I don't know how to make her funny.
Honey?
Didn't I say?
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Really?
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Would you leave us alone right now?
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Anymore.
That for us?
And?
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
There's a test, you know.
I call that a perfect day.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
He's directing now.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Did he promise?
Through the sweats or not?
We're great.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Otis!
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It's not like this all the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Yes.
That's under lock and key.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Oh, you know, I am.
Coffee?
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
I meant Sally.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
And Ryan works at home.
I will treasure this.
Ryan's really angry with me.
A lot of cakes.
That's very nice.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
Oh?
That was my clue.
The Shostakovich.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Are you lovesick?
Will champagne help?
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
You're a shit.
Well, something's wrong.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
She's such a great photographer.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
So how much do you hate her?
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Someone who follows his heart!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
I'm Princess Bala.
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Well I guess that makes us even.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Worker!  Come back here now!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Of course --
Of course not --
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
...I should?
What do you see out there?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
You're a real buddy.
Not there.  Under the mat.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Shall we say -- a dollar?
That makes me feel just terrible.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I think so.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
No -- I don't want anything.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
A bad insurance risk?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
You sure you want to throw that card?
Sure.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
There's a call for you --
For me?
I don't want to talk to him.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
That's terrible.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
I don't?
Oh.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I'm fine all over.
Last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Yes, sir.
I don't know.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
You can't come in.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Me?
Any of that coffee left?
Aren't you?
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Sure, Doc.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
No.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
No kidding.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Well -- thank you.
Let me take that.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
That's right.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Remember what we talked about?
That's enough, Fran.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Atlantic City?
I told you -- with my mother.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
My men --
You're out of your skull --
Fat. That's real fat.
We do.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
How much is left?
And the grass?
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Who knows what's up there?
They nail him for it bad ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Who is he?
No, sir.
Yeah.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
What's your name, sailor ?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Wh -- what?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Don't you agree?
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
No -- no, sir.
What do you mean, Colonel?
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Do you?
How's the pain?
I think think a lie stinks.
Fuck no.
What are you doing?
Yes...
Both of us...
Which one's the Colonel's?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Are you warm, Captain?
What?
117  CONTINUED:  
27   CONTINUED:
What are you doing?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
It's exactly what you meant.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Surviving is what I know --
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
How many do you see?
You don't feel cold?
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Huh?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
His name?
Spencer.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
How old are you?
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Note. Put it in the note.
Thank you.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Nonsense!
Hey -- you let him...
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
And?
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
I don't.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Yes. I really would.
Well...
Can you not be violent?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What are you trying to do to me?
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
What?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
What?
Ask him.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Go away.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Not it at all, really.
You consider your life easy.
I told you to go on in.
I think you gotta camp it here...
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Picking on me won't help.
But you know where you're lucky?
No shit.
Yeah.
What?
You can't --
Tachlinkov.
So what happens now?
Five million dollars?
Oh, yeah.
Sick.  The flu.
Who?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Ten million --
So this is something between you and him?
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
How old were you?
Because you are a women.
My first take?
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
I don't know.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Okay.  Then what?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
I don't believe that.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
I think I got one today.
They're worth less points.
How do you know they're not?
No?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
It can be.
Who was she?
Uh-huh.
Electra --
I wasn't watching television.
I thought it was interesting --
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
All the time.
It's possible.
Right.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
What's that? Free!
Like Custer huh?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Need any disks?
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
No beer?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
What happened?
So?
I can't go with him.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
You're sure?
That's my mum's.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Turned Czech huh?
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Will it help to get you out?
But we could go to London and live in England.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Okay?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What for?
No, it should be over soon.
Is it dry?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Sure!
Later.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
So go dance.
And I have no idea why.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Don't call him a dipshit.
Landon!
Were?
-- This play means a lot to me.
That's deep --
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah.
My relationship with God is my own.
No.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
People can see.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
Why not?
It's only 7:30.
You're acting like a crazy person.
What do you actually know with religion?
I might do it wrong.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Ergo?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
No.
I'm sick.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
I've talked to your father.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Dad --
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Yes.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Please.
For pay?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Where did you get -- ?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
What's N.R.C.?
How old are you?
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
I know.
Where did you get this?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's all taken care of.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
That's just what I needed to hear.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
You didn't?
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Catch!
Yeah, I guess.
What'd they look like?
I used to throw trash for the City.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Oh yeah?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Sure is pretty.
Is that right?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Hi.
Yeah? Why not?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Nah, I got me a job.
Doing what?
He'll say that?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Nothing.
You're a redhead.
My stomach's growling.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
How bad off is he?
How you doing?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Look at all this junk.
I don't blame him.
That's Montana over there.
What's that?
Just thinking.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
He offered you money?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
What's his problem?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
If you could, I'd –
What are they like? What are they about?
Well... THIS.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hah!
...Who?
How long you been up there, Fink?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
Hi, Charlie.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
...Your room does that too?
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Why don't we go to your room-
You gotta believe me –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Congratulations.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Must be.
Transient or resident?
What did... What did he –
Anyway.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
All night?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
How are you, Nick?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
How is your -- personal life?
How about the booze?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
I don't need any help.
How long were you having sex with him?
I don't smoke.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
Why not?
There's a name from the past.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
What did he say?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
Did you miss me?
No.
Why not?
Why?
How did it end?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
He was murdered.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
Thanks.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
Maybe the maid did it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
What do you think?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
Let's get out of here.
The whole thing – painting.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Saddle River, New York!
New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
MOTHAFUCKAH!
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
I need a dealer.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Out?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Who am I?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
About what?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
She's good.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... What's the matter?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
I really... admire you.
Some of them.
See you later.
You're a fast mover.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Hey, Rene.
I didn't know.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Uh-oh!
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Well that's a ... long story ...
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Pouring myself into my work.
"We"?  You and...
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
... eight, seven...
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
You certainly will not.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
You have?
Oxbridge Academy?
Keep it.
What exactly are you doing?
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
We gotta get those locks changed.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
I find that unlikely.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Then you never loved me?
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
It'll never work.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why do I keep doing this?
What?
Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Wacko? That a technical term?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
That kid is amazing.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Touchy, touchy.
I don't-.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Holy shit.
About what?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you want a drink?
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Keep her on the line!
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
There aren't hotels?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Hi,
Here, let me do that.
Annie, it's me.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
Ahm....
A car sounds sensible.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
... in the distant future.
Nope.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
This sucks.
We're gonna get paid to score.
And Boot-Head.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Damn, huh huh.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
That was boring. Huh huh.
That's not that much.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Uh...
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Well where is she?!
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Uh... dill, um, face...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Ah, the witness?
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Cavity search...?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
Chief, look!
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
She's ready.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What...?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
We're...
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
No.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's it!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
You've got to help them.
Your qu...?  But you're...
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Why not?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Any particular kind?
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
Okay?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
No, Robert.
... Oh? You've heard?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Yes, sir.
I hope you're comfortable.
I agree.
I would like to watch television.
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Chauncey!
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Yes. That could be true.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Hello, Sid.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Yes. It's a very good show.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Hello, Ronald.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I agree.
... That is a very small room.
... I see.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
But you won't sign, correct?
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Try again.
... How are the kids getting along?
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I never played a jewel thief.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Now?
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Why aren't you at work?
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
What?
No they're not.
Yes.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
The iguana?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I know.
I said "yes."
Security.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
No. I understand perfectly.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yessir.
Dr. Lester...
Emily Dickinson.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Who told you?
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
But I think I have another plan.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fork ah did?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
Anybody else?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Why not? I need to get in there!
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Yes?
Never heard of it.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Well what?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You still know.
No. Sorry.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YES.
Baby, don't be like that.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Your mother all right?
Well, good luck with the job.
What you want?
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Yes ma'am.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Out where?
True.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
For what?
No, You looking good.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah?
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Fuckin' A.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
He peed on the Dude's rug--
No--
What do you need that for, Dude?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I was talking about my rug.
A hundred.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
She most certainly was not!
The main guy, Dieter--
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Well...no, of course not--
So...that doctor.
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Am I wrong!
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Walter!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
The nail polish, Walter.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Thanks Walter.
Huh?
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Who the fuck is that?
Dude?
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
You monsters!
I said out.  Now.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Impressive.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
You're hurt.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Where the hell have you been?
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
You want me to hunt them for you.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
From his father, of course.
We're locked in.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
What about you?  You're not coming?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Who dies first?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You used me as bait?!
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Is it bad?
Get out of here --
How's it going, Kam?
I was afraid that might happen.
But you -- died --
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
But you use blood banks --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Whistler!
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
What, are you alright?
Trying to find the energy.
Inside the grave?
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
What's she look like?
--how old?
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
So says her website.
What?
I want to see the tapes.
Nothing. I dunno--
--like you hurt the baby--
--hours before--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
You want a hand?
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
What I never could figure about the movie?
--yeah, a hand or something--
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Nobody's going anywhere--
--turn the camera off--
I'm not finished.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
--whatever you want, no problem--
She got <u>paid</u>.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
What?
Dad...?
What?
--bullshit--
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
--I know!
Shoot.
Domini.
Why?
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...Where is everything?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
I own the place.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Back where?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
What.
Howdy stranger.
Where was I?
What day is it today, Angie?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
What?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Those are my breasts.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Yes.
No. What is happening?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
. I. uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
It used to make me laugh .but.
Do you like my body?
I want you to hurt me.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
Shh. I'll tell you.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
Nothing.
Okay Frank.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Yes. I do.
What's the plan.
Are you sure?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
You worry about me really?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Excuse me?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
I don't know...
Yeah.  She told me.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Because I got caught.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Diego?  It's George.
George.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Coke.
Cocaine?  How much?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Mexico.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Yes, it is.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Sure.
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
I meant every word of it.
What do you guys want?
I said, I've seen it before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
What do you want from me?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
For instance, something like this?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
Holy shit, Dulli!
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Which "district" do you belong to?
What ... What must I decide?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Who is speaking?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
I think I'm going to make your day.
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
What did they argue about?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Objection!
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
I had some papers to pick up.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes.
Is it Marsh?
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
How long were you together?
I had bypass surgery.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.
Why not?
Can you give the court an example?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Yes.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
Yes.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
No.
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
Who told you that?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
P.M.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Why not?
Yes -- she did.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
You lied to me!
What?
You were brilliant today.
What are they saying?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
I can back it up.
Really.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
No.
It was a place to start.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Not even if they're a dork?
I nearly died when we split the bill.
We were here two Christmases ago.
SO!
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Lawyer here?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Oh.
So, how long you've been living here?
Oh. How old?
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Why?
Then what happened?
And did you?
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
No. I'll do them later.
Yes.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No, I'm just saying --
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
But you don't mind.
Trouble. Why?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
Then he can move! People move!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
You feeling better Franny?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
'Bout 4:30.
What's her name?
Betty.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
It clearly states in the will --
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
'S up?
Just some flies.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Looking to score?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Just try it.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Since we was just grasshoppers...
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
All the more reason I should be here.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
You got the shit?
Where is it?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
I didn't sell it.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
But --
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
How the fuck can I open it?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
I didn't expect --
What are you talking about?
Why?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar, what are you going to do?
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Shut up, Violet!
What did she do to you?
I had to.  You made me.
What?
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Another time.
No.
Are you okay, Violet?
We was worried about you, Cease.
Yeah.
Is that the money?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
So this is temporary for you?
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
You're doing everything yourself?
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
I wanted to apologize.
How did you meet him?
Almost five years.
What?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Mickey?
Yes.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Any bodyguards?
Why?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Oh, thank God.
I'm still here.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I want a second opinion.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
What do they want me to do?
I don't know.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
You're a U.S. Citizen?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Really.
I've got a situation here and --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
No.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Where are we?
So this is it, right?
Thanks for the ride.
-- we'll explain it --
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
This your store?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
My husband's out looking for him.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
What?
Abbott wants to talk.
-- what're you talking about? --
... And then some.
I think we'd better have a look.
...ven't you?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Go away.
You are late.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
You got the wrong man.
So how ...?
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Take her off the list.
Say it was a mistake.
Do you know what you're doing.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
You stupid bastard!
Yes.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
If you say so.
Are you alright?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
It's heavy.
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, no system is.
Every day?
"And your children all gone."
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Are you still following me?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
What do you think? ... is it me?
But if they did promote you
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
What?
That's it.
You are good to me Sam.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
This is your dream girl, is it?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You haven't switched it on.
My mother said it would be all right.
This isn't rare!
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Sam!!! 
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Have you got one or haven't you?
For God's sake, what's happened?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Are you expecting anyone?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
No, no, that's impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Is this what you gave Mary?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
No way, man.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
He's working a double shift.
He's better, isn't he?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
You look so different.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Five years.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
I think the worst is over.
He got better.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
It's early for him.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
That's ridiculous.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
Turn it off.
Don't push it, Larry.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
And the rule was...
It's not loaded.
I don't think so.
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Why do you say that?
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
I didn't know you were going with him.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Aaron, will you tell me?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Ready.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
We came from Washington.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Goodbye, Paul.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
Yes.
And Bobbie says...
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Is everything all right?
Anchor?
...good-bye then.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Hey?
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Billion.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
Well, what is it?
So you like me, huh?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
How can you say that to me?
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I'm sorry.
What, right now?
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Are you nervous, Walter?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
What the hell's going on?
Look at the size of it!
Yes Walter.
I know what it is to be ignored.
Are you ready?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
I like you very much, Walter.
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Just about anything, Walter.
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Man this is heavy!
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
People seem to like my cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
H-have a seat?
Yeah, why?
Police officer.
Telling you what?
Smack?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
After that we go no more!
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
It's like...you've turned on.
Gee.  Thanks.
Oh, OK.
I don't think this is gold.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Booo!
You're the guys from the movie!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Dying.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
You okay?
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Hey there.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I thought we were meeting here.
How are you doing?
Where are you gonna go?
Yeah?
Buffy?  What's wrong?
Who?
Come again?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Bugs.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
What are we doing?
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
China.
How do you know all this?
Ow.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Oh, him.
What?
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Not a pressing issue.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
What!?!
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
Come one, that was so weird.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Nicole...
My parents have money...
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
I never thought of that.
They'll kill us!
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
What?
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
You should be at the game.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
You got me all confused.
Crash...I want you.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Will that work for me?
You missed him!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
You're a cocksucker!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
What do I got?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Forget it.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
I don't believe in fighting.
Pussy.
I'd kill ya.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
Was I at that dinner?
He even played golf with the President.
What do you propose?
Fine, fine. How's your family?
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
All right, Ace?
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I lost control?
Hey, she came to talk...
That's right, yeah.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Yeah.
What - what, Caesar's?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
She was afraid to call you.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
How'd you know I was here?
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
No problem.  Sorry.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
No, Ace.
Ace, listen to me.
We need this guy.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Why not make them happy?
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
I - I - I...
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Yeah.
You sure?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Yeah.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
What are you talkin' a- ?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I didn't take your pills.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
And...
Mm-hm.
I bought him a watch too.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Get off of me! Stop it!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Oh, sh-
Fuck you.
I wouldn't do that...
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Well...
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
I really think you're -
Can you do it with your left hand?
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah?
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back out there.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Is that what you did?
I did - I didn't -
Carmine left?
Calm down! Calm down!
What?
How are you?
I know.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
He gives a fuck what I do?
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Let me think about that.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Hm.
You did. You're right.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Lester - he called you here.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
There's more!
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Two.
You know why, right?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Get up.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
Hey. This is Shelly.
Stacy. 
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Hey.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
My fuckin' head.
Since when do you talk like that?
There's a lot of people here.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Yeah.
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
Guilty. I am.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
How heroic of you...
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
Selina, are you okay?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Winning.
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Even the skylight?
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What's the catch?
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
I still have one left...
You think so?...Selina?
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
For when the time comes..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
You turned around!
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Okay, deal.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
Have you got to tell her your life story?
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
You gotta just look the other way.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Or relieve me of it later.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Lady, try making some sense.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
Who?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
And that was the end of it?
Pictures.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
You can't give up.
No.
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
God, if he doesn't come back --
Your husband?
Yes.
Why can't it be her?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
The guy with the transplant.
Damned if I know.
You timed that beautifully.
Who's in back?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
I'm still okay.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Satisfied?
You should've done all this before.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I thought you'd know me by now.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
I'm in awe.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Can I make a quick call?
Saw that one.
Jimmy.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
You American?
The accent, I suppose.
Everybody wants something.
You on the game?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
How different?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Want to look after you.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
You could?
How?
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
What?
I'm not sure.
You'd do anything for me?
You want to make me look like him...
I'm going home!
I had to go to work!
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Yes.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Meet Col --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Did you give him it?
Have a look at him.
You don't know that.
I know.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
And what if you don't?
Jude?
Thanks.
I told him.
Why?
I thought it was Dave.
Hope not.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
What do you mean you can't?
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She'd be anyone's type.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
She's a friend of mine
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Like what?
Do you?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
I didn't.
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Nothing.
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
Come and get me, soldier --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
You're going to look for him -- now?
What is it?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
Yes, you told me.
Of course there is!
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Oh, I see.
Thanks very much.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
Yes.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Reggie -- listen to me --
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Hm?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
No -- not yet.
What do you mean?
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
Please keep it.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Swiss.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Oh, la.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Shakespeare never said that.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
What are you doing here?
Doing what?
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Go on.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Yes -- that's right.
Words can hurt very much.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
What is it about?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Yeah? What's that?
Yeah?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
I never fucked Rod.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
That's impossible.
It won't happen again.
You said that two weeks ago.
I want you to head right home after school.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Are you sure?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
This will relax her.
She works at a church?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
No.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
We just found another body.
Of course I'm scared.
Yes.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
I was desperate. It was gross.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
What?
You can't tell your parents.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Stag?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I heard you got attacked.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I do not.
Are you coming to the party?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Wait.
Yeah.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
You can have both if you want.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
A little early for a delivery.
No argument there.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since when does...

Except for the fact that I need cash.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...truck.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
I got, uh....
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
Would you hurry up, please?
That dog was mean before I met him.
Come on, get in the truck.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Doesn't work.
Okay.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...I'm not the psycho.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...let live.
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
 Okay.
Get over!  Get over!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on...
Shut up!
 

Come on.
...to him!  You don't know who...

I don't want you to come anyway. 
Keep still.
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.

Okay.

...piece of shit was worth.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
...truck.
Listen, Arlo...
...shit.


We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Reach into my pocket.
Yeah.

...to him. 

Okay...


Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Okay.  Come on, big guy!

Stop limpin' around like that.
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Who put the big hurt on...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Thank you.
...-tiatin'.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.

Hey, be cool.

Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
...without compunction.

...help you?
So you called the damned thing Elvis
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Is it--?
Yes, sir.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
You'll kill us all!
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...and the government.
Grateful?
"Went away."  I like that.
...happen if I drop this?
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
I'll do it.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
...comes up that road.
There.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
Quite a getup for jacking...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Doc...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.


I would've in another life.
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
I can handle it.
Yeah?
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Hit it...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Uh-huh.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...without caution...
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
 ...miles. 
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
Lying? 
...hands!
 Listen, Pappas...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Oh.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
It's too late, Mason. I've...
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
None.
Yeah.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Avocado groves?
I've got her.
What is it?
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Oh, my, yes.
Of course I do. Where are you?
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What's that, Curly?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
I'll just tell my wife.
I don't know...
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Well you own a lot of land.
You've done well by yourself.
Looking for someone.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Would you like something to drink?
That's not his apartment.
What?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
And I want to know where.
Where are you going?
Do? To who?
Give me an example.
Including the death of your husband?
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
I am not!
Upstairs. Why?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
I said I want the truth.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Yeah, Sophie.
Oh my goodness.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I'm sorry. We don't.
I'm sorry, I --
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
I cut myself shaving.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
The water.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
But...
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Gittes.
He was expecting you?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
They were partners.
What about?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Neither do I.
Not exactly.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You don't say?
Fifty lire... 
Why? What do you mean?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
You understand now? You see it clearly?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
I didn't see that.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Enthusiastic?
Yes -
Wasted?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
There is no news big enough.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Emily, you -
I know it is, Brad -
Oh!!
Where's the towel?
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I didn't say.
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Yes -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
You're my wife, Susan, and -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
No, you're not.
Don't go, Susan.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir. 
Do you know what that is?
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
Yes?
Charlie -
I'm drunk.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Are you finished?
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Yes.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Maybe you could remember something that -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
She's plastered, isn't she?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Yeah, but not in here.
I take it she likes the guy.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Dick.
No, this is great.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Nobody! I swear!
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I left like an hour ago.
I'm serious.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Nobody. It was closed.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
You only brought one ball?!
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
No, thanks.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
All four?
Blasphemy.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
The milkmaids.
Can you believe this?!
Why'd you apologize?
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Helluva game!
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me? 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Number six.
You hate people.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
No!
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Let me borrow your car.
I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
Hey, what about Veronica?
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Around three or something.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
You should shit or get off the pot.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Are you open?
No, she's getting married.
One seventy-nine.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
It's not my store.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
So I'm told.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Why did you agree to come in then?
Bunch of savages in this town.
What were you doing?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
She called you, didn't she?
How much money did you leave up there?
You're trusting.
How many girls have you slept with?
Three.
Where?
What do you mean?
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
Lower your voice!
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
A few?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
Thank you for the lasagne.
Sure.
I don't want Caitlin...
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
You're not?
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
I will. Take it easy.
What?
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Surprise me.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Glad you could drop in.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
What are we going to do?
How're ya feeling?
That's it, you look like a professional.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Excuse me?
Which could maybe what?
From one professional to another, of course.
Where?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
He doesn't want my help.
You got to go back now!
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
Call me sentimental.
You attacked me.
Gabe...your arm?
I won't do it.  No way.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You said there was a way across.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Tucker and Walker.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Don't use my name!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
No names, this is an open line!
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Won't you join me, sir?
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Who are they, sir?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Thank you very much, sir.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
I beg your pardon?
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Surprise?
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Yes sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Yes.
You're keen on music?
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth is faster.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
The ride is free.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
You need a vacation.
...he's two floors below you.
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
What kind of question?
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
What?
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
You guys been holding hands?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Not our call, Phil.
You're kidding me.
Let's not get excited, sir.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
You mean like benefits?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
I think he's dead.
You're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
I don't think I can do this.
Got it?
Two...
I tried it.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You had to kill Heller?!
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
What'd they do?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
They said send you downstairs.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
I was only going one way.
Mississippi?
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
Do you still ride?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Switch the charts.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Yeah.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
What is it with you and the space program?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Please put it down.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
A water main broke.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
Now's not really the time to get into this --
You look great.
Love at first sight?
Back where?
Geronimo is down.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Excuse me?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
I'm still listening.
You do recognize it then?
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Which way did he go?
What?
So?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
What is it?  What's happened?
Actually I'm running late --
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
It's beautiful.
Can't we get rid of them?
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Is that your official response?
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Can you show me?
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
So.  What happens now?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
What's that?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Greenbank?
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
Ellie -- are you okay?
What day?
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
What'd you think?
The final countdown.
I do.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
Gotta go, Arletta.
I don't know, Boss.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here, Captain.
What happened? How far did you get?
That's my baby.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Well, how far didya get?
One, two, three... 
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Fear of what...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
You bastard!
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
I never hurt nobody...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
No.  Not yet.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
You're calling me a crank?
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Is that it?
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
What happened to you?!
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
I don't want this.  What are they?
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
Are you always so bold?
The lock...
You know how to use this?
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Look at her legs.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
We could use a little help.
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
No. But when he's in that car...
One of your suitors?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
What's up with you?
Please, Letty.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
What about this one?
Ecru.
What's his name, Letty?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Don't be fresh.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
Chair, cup and ball.
A while, I guess.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Do you?
Michael, I...
Furnished?
I love your apartment.
I think I should go home.
Silly?   Silly am I?
And all the plans we have.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
That's a big question.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Not today.   Where are your friends?
They left about a half hour ago.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
What?
Good.   I'm good.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
They're gonna be what?
Uh, no --
Yes.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
He said to go fuck yourself.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
What'd you get?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
It's me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
I just thought that--
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
What'd you guys find?
The map said to go left.
Yes.
What is it you do, Sami?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
You lived there. You know the city.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
God, I want to go home.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
No.   It's mine.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I think we went the wrong way.
J&amp;B?
You ask a lot of questions.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Who are you waiting for?
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then leave her to me.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Do you think you are a real master?
Why do you want to teach me?
Tell me, who is your master?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Please sit.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
What do you think?
Here you must be in proper attire.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Never!
Give it back!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I left the training early.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
Don't you want to see her again.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
But don't be too lenient.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
What in the hell... do you call that?
My name.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
You look like a rock star without a job.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Well, how's your friend?
Mom tried to cook.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Go away.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Who got himself what?
"Our" Crow...?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
That's right.
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What'cha reading?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Need a lift?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
That's also none of your business.
Yes.
No, not at all.
What?
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Am I bothering you?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Are you shitting me?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
That's great.
It was nothing.
Okay.
Something awful happened last night.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I was just kidding.
You think?
Want a blow job?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes!
Is she with you?
Ronald?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
What's wrong with you?
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
You amaze me.
Yippy.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Morning.
She shot you down.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Bad time?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
I accept. Now get out.
I think you have your answer.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Excuse me.
What do you want?
Do you know where she is?
Annette! Annette!
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You're shouting at me.
Ollie.
What?
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Certain wishes do.
They ran away.
Just you wait!
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
But there's no one here, darling.
No.
But where do you come from?
But where is that?
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But what happened to the little deer?
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
What?
And does he kill people?
Hide me? Why?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Anything's better than Mark.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
Do you really need these?
Or if there's a full moon.
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
At least your PMS is over.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Give him the tampon test.
You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Okay. I guess so.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
I haven't gotten it yet.
What happened to his tooth?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Script coverage?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
When's the last time you saw him?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I'm sorry.
I really gotta get going.
Yeah. Maybe.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Is it that funny?
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
Peter I love you too but...
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I ate a guy last night.
No, it was our first date.
It's for you. Frida.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
He was found a few blocks away.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Sell maps?
They don't speak English...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
You typed this report?
Why, yes.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Who?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Then we must call the police.
What happened to you?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
Dave...
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
Are you threatening me?
I'm not sure.
A teleprompter.
Presence.
President vetoes works bill?
Yes, Mr. President?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Oh... Hi.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
How'd you get started?
Really?
Yeah.
What are you staring at?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
What?
Are you hungry?
You have a lot of secrets.
I can't.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Miss Henried, I think you better...
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Curse?
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
It's been fired.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Sounds boring to me.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Charlie Dalton.
It will?  How do you figure?
Women swoon!
At Chet Danburry's house.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
You know what really excites me about you?
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Sure.
Charlie...
It does?  What?
You fucked up little prick!
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Yeah.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
I don't want to read.
I've found it.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
But if he said no before then...
What is that supposed to mean?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Do you have to quit the play?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
You're going to have to get a new one.
Not an option.
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Or maybe not.
Check it out!
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Yeah.
Damn right!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
You're full of shit!
What the --!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
I know! I fuckin' know!
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
No.
I have to go.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Everybody love Linda.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Yeah?
Hey, guys...
Vince. Hey, you guys --
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
You seem... disturbed.
Who the hell is he?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
You should have put that on last night.
You do?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
The shot?
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Hell no!
No.
That's it. No. No way.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
What's that noise?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
What did you say?
My man Dubbs.
Funny guy.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Not the 'T' word.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Wanna come?
Yes.
Hey, buddy...
How then?
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Sanchez...?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
They always are.
Hi.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
What do you want?
What Grange?
You're not -- Dorothy.
Mornin', Jabez ...
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Opportunities?
Leave your tongue off of that!
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
What -- what's on your mind?
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
There's no joy in it for me.
Why of course --
Why not -- ?
Down, Shep! Down!
We can still use my butter money.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
I'll get the doctor.
Tired?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Come in, Sheriff.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
What's that?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
John.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Put it down now.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
...I've missed you.						*
John!
Yeah.  How'd you know?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
'Roy'.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Yeah?  What's the odds?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Is that him?
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Gene -- you smilin'?
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jenny?
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
What are you talking about?
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
What trip?
Where you gonna go?
What am I supposed to do?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
They're okay.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Okay, what do you give me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
You're full of shit ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
You got Bank Americard?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Because I don't want cancer.
... The bodies out the door.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
I want him to think that.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Yeah ...
Okay, Sonny.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Okay, when do I get them?
I am.
Hey, you okay?
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Oh.  Run.
And if you can't deliver them?
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Hello?
What?
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
Where is the money?
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
That's the rumor on the street.
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
No. Please enlighten me.
Is that you, Domino?
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Cool it, Choco.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Fast and or furious.
So, in other words, you are not down.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
My name is Eddie.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'll see you out.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
It's dug.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Depends.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Quit bullshitting.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
You a blue-moon fool.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Be a man.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Smack him back.
You deaf or what?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
That's what you think?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Some are OK.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Take it easy, Pop.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Depends how you define 'new'...
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
You did?
Come over around seven.
Would you like something to drink?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
I know I am, Mom.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Home school. Til today.
No no no no no.
Why not?
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Just a guy I hang out with.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
Peg leg?
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
Collins is a great man!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
I don't know. Owwww.
...cause you said...
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Me, me, me!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
No. What happened?
It's okay. I want the rush.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Try one in a million!
You had some questions.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
TURK, leave him alone.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
I'm so close I can feel it.
That's it. I'm done.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Can you believe it?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
That's the downside. There is none.
Okay.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Obviously.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I am strong!
It's the big potato.
Knock knock.
What?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
Love it!
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
We have just folded space from Ix...
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Is he....?
Run!
Yes...
Stop him yourself.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Why do they come?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
THE PAIN!
What is it?
Where?
Did they try and fail?
You mustn't speak of...
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Really?
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Mmph?  Where am I?
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Really?
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Um, okay... roll camera
These shoes are itchy.
This is kind of a stream--
H-how'd you know?!
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Boris Karloff!?
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Would that work?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Is there a script?
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
There's still a sex-change --
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I am.  How's your father?
What do you mean?
Oh.  Okay.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Dynamite --
The sun.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
You don't wanna be noticed?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Yeah...?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Yeah, so... ?
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
Yes, Ed.
Sure.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
I don't think so.
He's who we want to go with.
Take him off the air.
Where are you going?
Thank you. Can I see her?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Right, right...
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Mm.
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
St. Joseph's.
The doctor said you were having sex.
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Yeah...
Are you sure about this?
Right.
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari...
No. Who?
Twenty-nine.
There's a list.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Where?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
It's not their fault.
What do we have to do?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
I was in jail.
Check forging.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Oh!!
Ohhh...
Sign here, please.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
What?
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
So what brings you here?
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Uh-huh.
Why are you doing this?
What a surprise.
Hmm?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
Hey Yeah?
Yeah.  I'm here.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
I'm not like you.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
How'd she meet Patchett?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Did they deserve it today?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Yeah, I hate them.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Will you work for me?
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What's through here?
What happened?
How's it going to look on your report?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Lynn.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
I got her address.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
More or less.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
What about you?
Damnit...
Glasses.
It's a simple question.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
What's on the call sheet?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
What are you talking about?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
Lynn Bracken.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You sound like you mean it.
I'll take your word for it.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Right now, before I back down.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Officer White?
Is she?
Not a word.
And Reynolds?
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
It'll be our secret.
Working whores with squad two.
What'd he give to you?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
I don't know who he is.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
What do they have to do with this?
You're crazy.
We said a hundred.
Jesus!
I called my wife!
I didn't use my name.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Where?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Drive.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
No.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Pretty fast.
Well then who can?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
What are you saying?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Oh my God.
With what?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
That's my point.
The robbery.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
To buy lingerie.
You should take this seriously.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
It's not true.
I know.
It's not real...  That's not me.
I know.
Yes.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
It's a brand new card.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
That ain't me.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
It is fish.
Brill.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than me.
How can I be sure.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
You're a moron, you know that?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
My shoe?
Listen--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Bobby--
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
I don't under--
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Mr. Dean--
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
It's okay to use the phone.
Alright!
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
I don't know. I mean--
Listen to me.
No, I--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Yeah?
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
How can I reach you?
He got hit by a bus.
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Am I to understand--
We'd have to--
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
So they know everything.
Which stall?
Excuse me?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
He said - be careful.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
This is - what is this?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Would you let me pass?
We've got to get you out of here.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I believe I'm rather late.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Shut-up!
Don't cut me.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So was my Patient.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Oh, all over.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
Me?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
How?  How can you see anything?
Could I have a cigarette?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Excuse me -
Yes?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
Arguing about books.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Is something funny?
I've met you before.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
You get Hardy.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I try not to expect you.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
This is hot!
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
This is wonderful!
Kip?
What about your rank or serial number?
This was your garden?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
I have a question...
I don't want to waste your time.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
We going somewhere?
You want me to pick up a painting?
We're going to die, aren't we...
We're doing this together. We're partners.
That's because I wanted them to!
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
So how long to pop the floor?
You bought this for me?
To us. To the Mask.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Put this on!
Always in a rush.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You two make quite a couple.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
Yeah?
You're a girl.
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
What medical records?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You wanna talk about --
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
I want my fucking money --
What's a demur?
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
Here what comes?
What is that?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
You come to the right place.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
I don't know.
PG& -- Are you sure?
We'll see.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Cause I don't even know you.
How?
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
Thinking.
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
Who's Baxter?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
I'm looking for someone.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
That's right.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sir, I was wondering ...
You, too, golden rod.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Han, we need you here.
Not you?
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
I don't know what he's talking about.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Probably an asteroid field ....
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
What's going on?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
We have no use for your kind.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
I thought I was in good shape.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
My mind fills with so many images.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
They're...pretending to dress.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
With food?
What are they doing here?
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Humans?
I thought he was, but he came back.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up, Plissken.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Got a smoke?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Where is it?
Where are they going?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Where?
Are you crazy?
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
You're running out of time.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
But not from your destiny.
How? Where?
In the great book.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
At your service, sir.
But, I'm here.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
You, my lord.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Why?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
There is one.
Who?!
You are truly magnificent!
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Now you must pay me.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
I see, your excellency.
Oh great, anything else?
Burke.
It's serious?
No. Not at all,
Yes, I go now.
There is nothing.
What!
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Why the math?
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words?
On what?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
In Europe.
Yes. He's already here.
When can I have one?
Well you know it's okay.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
What are you doing here?
Oh my God!
Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
Oh, Christ.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
You might loosen the straps then.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
In here. With us.
Intensely.
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
No.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
What's this about?
I've seen him.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
I'm afraid.
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Give me the keys.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Little slow tonight.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
They gotta go.
My brother and I. One each.
Oh.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Out.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Lotta water.
So we on tomorrow night?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
Why the interest?
What?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
A gust of wind killed him.
That's what we agreed.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
No.
How about these?
Oh, brother.
You recognized me.
I thought we had separate rooms.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Yeah.  You mind?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
What're you doing down here?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Just until we find another girl.
Stay off it.
Fuck you.
What're you doing?
Yeah, fine.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
She asked for it.
The audience was a little off tonight.
Blanche.
Yes, it is.
How should I take it?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
What-?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Uh... good.
Right.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Virgins?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Huh?
Huh?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
How come?
No.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
His kid's sick.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Like a baby. You?
Guess I got a little scattered.
I can keep the beat.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Hi.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Another five years, huh?
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
How do you know?
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
What do you mean?
Thanks, Pollux.
Were you there to catch me?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Now what?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
What happened?
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
Just following your example.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
I'm not going anywhere.
You always say that -- then you leave.
You're wearing your suit --
What's on your mind?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Excuse me?
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
We’re almost done here...
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
This is day care.  It’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
Big Ed’s.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Why not?
Something like that.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Where were you?
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Hello!
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
If you want to look at it that way...
Not it...?
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
You’re moving...
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
Do I know you?
Of course I did.
I'd like that, too.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Don't you have anywhere to go?
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
Relax, it's casual.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
What about his first born?
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Five times.
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
We had a tough year.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
Ben, come in.
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Stop it.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
And if he's not...?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Front page?
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Which was?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And reverse the mutations --
I can...make it work.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
What are you doing?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Then how come it worked loose?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
You said there was a quick way out!
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
You have no right to blame Duval --
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
Come on -- it's no use!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What is it, Skipper?
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Yeah, you already said that.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Personal matters.
Three people. In Brainerd.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
End a April.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Can you be any more specific?
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
Yah, right -
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Know who this is?
Yah!
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Good day, sir.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
We might be innarested.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
...There's a million dollars here!
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Uh-huh.
Oh, pretty good.
No, no, that's fine.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Nope.
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
...Well, yah. Who's this?
So... they didn't...
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Oh. Geez.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
They're real good.
Not on your feet too much?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
They announced it?
The first rule of Project --
There's no one else here.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Oh.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
This is... really a shock...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Practicing what?
I'll take the parasites.
Should we?
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
Look, this is a bad time...
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
What did you say... ?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Hello?
Tyler?
Who's this?
Oh, yeah.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
The things you own, they end up owning you.
I don't follow...
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
How do you feel?
Call what off?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
What is this place?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
You quit?
I asked you what you studied.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
I want to hear the truth.
Is this really news to you?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
I can't let you...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
Yes...
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Not exactly according to plan.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
I swear on my life, I won't...
Maintenance.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
I... I don't know...
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Carter.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
You mean Alex Browning.
I'm not following you --
Whoa, nine months?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Can I ask you a question?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
4:25.
Right. April 25th.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Can't you open the door?!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
That's what I'm doin'!
Huh?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
You okay?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
I've seen worse places.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
You never been in one of those things.
You better take off.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Where did you find this clown?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
I know.  I go with you.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Not yet.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
Christ almighty.
About 22 hours on site.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
What's up?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
I know...
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Am I out of here?
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
What did you want?
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
Most men are.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
He's not a moron.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
What if I was a relative?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
Where?  Maybe we can.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Which ones?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
I need a drink.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Who?
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Divorced.
You have a disease.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
You're not going to play it again.
Now, now.
You can sing the song.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
How far are you going to?
Who?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
I didn't get it, did I?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Now don't...
Oh.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
Uhm hmm.
Like what?
Do you want some gingerbread?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
I'm talking to you, Tita!
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Catherine...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
Robert, I think you better just...
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
It is true.
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
Just chill.
Wussup?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You here to see somebody?
So what do you want with her anyway?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
What?
I have no idea.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch!
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Fletch.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
You can't keep me here.
Not a prayer.
Greetings, everyone.
Two bs?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
So what do you figure?
Fletch...
Jesus.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
You're in the Records Room.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
You may be right.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Harry S. Truman?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Then he has.
He sighs.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
I know.
They bust you every week.
Fletch?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
We can't talk about it here.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Why don't you try suicide?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I'm still here.
Sure, all drifters do.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
I bet you do.
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I ordered lunch.
You ordered it here?
I mean put clothes on.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
What is this?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm terrified.
You shouldn't be here.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
I would, actually.
Lock's busted.
Moved out.
I never read the paper.
Gummy and two cops...
Utah?
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
What...
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Jim Swarthout?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Excuse me?
Have what?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I don't know, what was the case?
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How much?
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
My axe!
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
I can't kill this kid's father...
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Did he just say what I think he said?
You need it.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
What are you running from?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Jazz, we're talking here.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
You don't use shit?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
What?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Man, I'm clean.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Le sommes nous?
Il est en retard.
What happens to the schedule?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
I got no music!
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
You want some eggs.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Toy wit' this will ya.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Timezit?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
What is that old building?
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
I been damn careful up to now.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Hey, bud.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Did he?
I'm off.
Okay...
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
It's really you, isn't it?
What do I tell them?
How?
You really wanna know?
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
What?
How the hell am I gonna do that?
What's wrong?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
You used to be on the job?
I hear that.
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Breakfast?
Why don't we go take a swim?
How about a roll in the hay?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I'm a slow eater.
Did you stay here last night?
This is too painful to look at.
Why don't you help us?
Bullseye!
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Why?
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
No.  No, it's not...
There...Ya happy?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
What's goin' on?
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Look --
Jesus!
Maybe you should be moving on.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
For a good reason.
Tell me!
Okay.
I know what it sounds like.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Really?
A major prick.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Dear Christ...
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
Everything okay?
I can't swim.
It's not that simple.
When did this start?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Hi, Sean.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Crosstown.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Say it again.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Asbestos lining.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Where are you going?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
How do you Eknow.
Great game.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does what feel comfortable?
What?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Mystery. Deception.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
How prominent?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
What did it say?
Pop, will you let me in?
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I can't find it.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
A grandmother. God bless you.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Why do you care?
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Sidney.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Burnt sienna.
What's good?
There was a review.
I think I remember.
Oh. You know him.
Alla puttanesca.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
So do I. Over and over.
He's a very sweet man.
Home.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Just an admirer...
I'm sorry.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
It's beautiful.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Have you read his magazine?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Grudges?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
Don't underestimate these imposters.
Jerome--?
Suit yourself.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
It needs work.
It's not too late to back out.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Where?
Come on--we're taking off.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
You're angry--
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What is it?
Flight got you nervous?
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
We'll try again.
Where did you get those?
How's Estelle?
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
I mean it.
Why?
Do you trust him?
Why didn't you tell me?
And switched keys.
What do you want to do?
You've got it all figured.
When are you going to learn?
Are you hungry?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Sounds good.
Oh, Jesus... how?
I'll be ready.
I don't know, airport I guess.
No, I'm not.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Yeah. I got out.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
How was that?
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You can trust him...
Yes.
What name?
Jack?
Good evening.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
I call that regular.
Oh, do you?
We went about together.
Yes, while he was here.
Was he?
So where are we going, Princess?
How'd you know where I'd be?
I don't know.
Yeah.
I left last year.
At me friend's house.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
That's what I was wondering.
Why would it?
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Are you a traveller?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
You're a bastard.
No.
Are you tired?
No. Are you tired?
Not much.
Meaning what?
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Nasty way to go.
What's that?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
Well, I think I had one once.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
...this shit...
I, I...I...
That's right?
...that's right...
Yes.
He is?
Yes.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
You don't ax your sales force.
Yes.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
What did you say?
You're actually talking about this?
You...
I'm sorry?
Dave.
What does that mean?
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
And why is that?
Fine.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
To the cops?
A waste of time?  Why?
Where were you?
I was at home, where were you?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Thieves.
Why?
Did they...?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
I don't know, George, why?
Go to lunch, will you...
Go to lunch, George.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
Shelly, you blew the last...
Shelly...
What two?
...I only...
Roma.
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Yes.
I will close.
Not lately you can't...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
And fifty bucks a lead.
What are we going to say?
I'm not sure I have two.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
How do you know I made it up?
What are you talking about?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
I've got the check...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
John: John:...my daughter...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
...yes...
No, his wife is.
What?
Mm.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Gimlet.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
I told you.
No.  She told me "right now."
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
I...
She told me not to talk to you.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Guess what the Machine did?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
...Mr. Williamson...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
What position did you occupy?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
The child cannot harm you.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I understand...
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
That's what I'm here for.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
It's the way Pop wanted it.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Senator Kane.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
However I can help you...
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
So?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
No.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
I'm not a kid.
I'm not married.
Why?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Of course.  I am married still.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Mornin'.
Nice place.
What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
This David's a friend?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
But we have to match the other sketch.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
No harm done.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
Do you mind?
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Need some help?
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
Hey, Boone.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Then who did?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Who was that at the door?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
How are you?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Sit?
What about?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
I knew you'd say that.
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
How is he?
What for?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
I know you.
And this has what to do with me?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Yeah.
What color?
How you doing, man?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
You look good...
No.
oh.
You getting my checks ... ?
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
You guys are through...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
You goin' home?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
Hey, now -
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
Too early to tell. Nervous?
You boost her -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
You know of one -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
What kind of trouble -- ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Very good...
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
I take out my slim-jim...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Wrong preposition...
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
What about me?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You know what you got here?
What? What happened?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Henry.  Wake up.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I got seared.
What about the schools?
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
You know what to do?
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
I got dry cleaning.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You're kiddin' me.
Come on, Will...
Some other guy?
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Seven.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Yes. Under two conditions.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Half-red, half-black--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
What are you smiling at?
Yes.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
I need someone with your kind of background.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Tom.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Who?
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
How about one now?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
No.
Well, are you going out again?
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
They could see that I meant it.
You're kiddin' me.
Do you have a soul-mate?
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
--No, have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I just want you to know, Sean...
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I kind of got that impression.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Oh, you will?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
I want to meet them.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
Want me to take a look?
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yeah.
Will ya look at her!
But ain't no reason--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
I guess that's what he looked like.
Want to work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Got a warrant?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
But we can still do it, honey.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Goin' far?
You ain't got to get sore.
What you mean?
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
How 'bout Granma?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Yes'm, that was it.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
What's these?
What's this?
Morning.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
You're so funny...
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Really...? So what?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Insane.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
What's that?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
--She's not dead---
No time.
No.
You never could have kept this from me.
What if I come back?
You kill people. 
How was your day, today, sir?
No.
Up on the right.
No deal.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
And they want me to make up for it.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
They were very upset.
There's nothing to be done about it.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
That's too bad.
How are you? How's business?
This is Annie MacLean.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Enjoy the day.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
I am comfortable.
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
What about him?
What?
Did he tell you that?
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Let's bring your bags inside.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
David?
It's me.
Hi.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I'm sorry.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
I love you.
Doing what?
What did he say?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Huh-huh. You?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
About what?
You're allergic to hay.
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
I'll help you with the coffee.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
- See, what you can do for him --...
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Tom?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I wouldn't let happen.
Isn't it like, obvious?
That's not a question, is it?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
You're looking fit.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Now that's cool.
Yeah, cool.
Welcome to our show!
Snoop onto them...
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Dead.
I'm taking over a TV network.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
What the hell is going on?
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Your slave?
And you have to smile.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
We caught 'em.
Never fear. I is here.
Joey, Joey...
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Hello?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
555-4202.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
Who's that?
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Yes.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Who you calling?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Got it Earl.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
It was the nightmare man
Where are you going?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
You look sharp. You understand?
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
When he makes that call.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Where's that Deputy?
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Of course.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Thanks.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You locked yourself in.
I'm scared.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You all right?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
There WAS.
I promise.
What is it, Laurie?
Are you sure?
Laurie, you come with us...
Let's make more popcorn.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Yeah.
Uh...
But I'm seeing him.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
I can't resist.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's really sad.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh.  Well, I live--
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
I thought you weren't coming.
This is not an easy situation.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
You bet.
Are you angry with me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Are you?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
I am... I did slave all day.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Why should I be afraid?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Me?
What's the problem?
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
No.
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, yeah?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
He's fine.
That's a beauty!
This is the second opinion.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Perfect!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Yeah.
He's married...
I know, no--  I know.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Hey, what's the matter?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
God!
I remember you.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it was.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Nobody ever said it.
You have.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You're kidding me.
Really?
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, God!
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, yeah?  What?
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Okay.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Tch.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Aren't you glad to see me?
...you don't have to think.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
You want me to be?
Who would that be.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
What, What, I can't hear you...
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
What else did I miss...?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
I like Popcorn...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Waited too long, hon...?  
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
And?  Then?
Who does not?
...long overdue.
Make them eat the figurine.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
What shape is the scar?
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Then what brings you back?
What does <u>that</u> mean?
My encounter.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
God, you're beautiful.
It's not my style, okay?
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
What are you doing here?!
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
Don't talk to me like that.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
And your worst enemy.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Did you miss him completely?
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Look who I've found!
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
sighs.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
is very angry.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
You're such an incredible woman.
Let's go overseas . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
I'm stumped.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No.
I understand... I won't-
Must be nice.
Really? Do tell.
GWEN?
What's the occasion?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Have we met?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
What's wrong, Trev?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
What?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Poor Trevor.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Bill, I...
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
The homeless!
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
You were... very... inspiring.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
What's the matter?
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
Helluva story!
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Where are these toys of yours?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Right.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
-- institution.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
About what?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
I've asked him what's wrong.
And?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
And it's a shorter commute.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
He made, you know, a remark.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
The cab's waiting!
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
I'd like that.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Central Park.
Around.
No.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
What?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Well?
No -- I will.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
How comes it your are not afraid?
The past?
I don't have any answers for you.
That makes you uncomfortable?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
--for three hundred years.
Must you fight him?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
We're holding the workers down below.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
What's that next to him?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
Why did you wait?
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
No.  The money, please.
I think he's dead!
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Jen?  Are you all right?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
We been through that.  Forget it.
What the fuck is that?
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
Please get away from me.
You gotta pee?
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
He didn't say.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Sounds like you know the job.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Are all of you named Jones?
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Not until the man calls.
How about you and your sister?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
He has lots of disks.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Who is it?
Where's your gun?
Marlon and Al....
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Please, I don't use guns.
Paul, you know who this is?
Anything. Strong.
I don't understand.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Whiskey?
Get in.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
You are a marked man.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Satellite feed.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Who did you call?
He will be here.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Thomas wants advice?
What?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Paul, don't let them die.
What!
This won't do.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
Go out! Where?
No, no.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Why?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
He has taken the presidential suite.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
There are soldiers.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
And what's Steven's status?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- bullshit --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
What?
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
-- I did: down here.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
What's down there?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Prove it.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
-- wit...nesses --
No...
I was in the middle of --
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
-- Eddie!!
Are we leaving mommy?
Can I have this room daddy?
What's he doing daddy?
What?
What the hell is that?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
The heater's here.
So what are you saying?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Who?
What are you talking about?
A friend?
How are we doing?
Oh my God where is she!
You don't think I know?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
It was a shame.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Where did you find this?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Well what is it!
What do you mean?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Uh-huh?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Why are you so interested?
What?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
And he still sits there?
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Terri?
What am I looking for?
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
How do we start?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
I miss you too.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
Alex!
"You could be swinging on a star."
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
Count of three?
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Don't you just hate kids...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
And I'll bring my entourage...
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Prison?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I wanna know...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Sharp.
The Hudswinger!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
About seven minutes.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Now, Aim --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
My pleasure, sir.
...It is?
Norville.
...education, were you?
Not even behind your back?
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Damnit, where's my car!
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
How's that, Sid?
I got gas, Bennie.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
She's got other problems, of course...
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Mrs. Rand...
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
But it's so far away...
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
That doesn't sound like him.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
No, Wes.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I often do.
Why did you come in here?
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
Got a meeting uptown.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
That shirt?
Well?
I'm fine dad.
So how's school treating you?
Classes?
Huh?
Birth control.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Dad stop it!
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
But...
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
I saw you on your bike today.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Educated guess.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Yes.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Huh?
No candy for me?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
I don't know.
Wow!
Huh?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Her name's Libbets.
All my model planes.
Just thought I'd stop by.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
So far.
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Who's playing?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
That's right.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
Did she?
They're all over everybody.
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Looks like the natives are restless.
One of your cases?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
I don't know.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
My arm!
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Down at the station?
No.
No back-up.
Yes, and very beautiful.
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
She is.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
That's what the one who made me said.
I can't save her.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Don't Louis --
Louis, put me in my coffin...
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
What danger?
Never.
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
What have I done?
It can't be...
But how do you know?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You can't look at them...
Shall we go on?
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
It's over, I'm telling you...
Yes...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Your what?
Storm season?
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
I'm the King of the World.
You get any sleep at all?
Nice move.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Julie?
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Never do that again.
Checking the locks again?
I'm fine.
You sure?
The shower again?
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Is there a problem here?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
What's going on?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
We'll only be a second, okay?
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Goodbye.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
But one must love a father.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Theodosia.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Oh, now —— now look here ——
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Theodosia --
Daughter -- my daughter --
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
I can't.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
What's that book you've got there?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Thanks.
Hey, Ernie!
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Goodbye, everybody!
Nice girl, Mary.
Oh, George!
George! George!
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Say, where's Mother?
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Made up your mind yet?
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Didn't you tell her?
Where'd you get that dress?
Is it snowing?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
You forgot something.
Don't!
That's awful.
Why'd they decide to move?
Loser sails home alone.
I don't know.
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Oh, c'mon.
Pop....
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
You don't make enough.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Can't you tell?
Door's locked.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
What's wrong?
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Martin, it could be anything.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
What's wrong?
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What's the lighthouse?
I don't care.
I want to go with you!
Yeah.
Be reasonable, please....
I'll need more men to look.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
They just wanted to say hello.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
It's too soon to move him.
I have to get out of here.
It's a shark's tooth!
I thought they were clever.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Like hell!
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
I think they'll come out now.
Hi, Mike.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
It's okay, Sean.
What're you doing later?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Now what?
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Calvin said it was all right.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Oh...
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
How far away is filter number four?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Gee, it's good to see you!
Come on, let's go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
She still talking to you?
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
You'll spoil her.
Come on, sweetheart....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
No way....
Like mother, like son....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Michael!  This thing working?
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're coming, aren't you...?
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Okay.
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
Promise me you'll be all right....
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
How do you like flying?
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
That's hard to imagine....
I hope she's a good sailor....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Grab your socks....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
What happened?
We'll be done pretty soon....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
How many...?
The readings suck....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Money is money....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Where is everybody?
We don't write up anything until we're done....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
And it's always worked?
What?
Who?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
You told me what?
Here it comes....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Cow tipping?
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
Only me and Mom ..
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Maybe?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Why's she blind, Bro?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
Sure.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Ease off, John ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
Listen, you don't havta come?
I guess by the bed.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What if we need a back up?
How do you know her hair's black?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Once.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Can I see your hands?
Are you wearing a uniform?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Pray?
How d'you know what I'm like?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
I can't identify him ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Yes, Sir.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Could you just stop moving?
Look, I don't want a --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Don't let him stay up too late.
He's asleep, right?
Oh come on --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
What --
If I said that, would you stay?
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
I heard.
Thank you.
Forgot your keys --
Not right now, Jerry.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Yes.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
If you get injured, you get nothing.
How do I know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Not everyone has what you have.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Gorgeous.
You gonna get that --
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
What's going on, Jerry?
Can you be quiet?
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
We can't just...
Nothing.
When did you have it last?
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
They couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
We need to head for the coast.
But then you never get to go in space.
You should.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
How did you know?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
I don't believe you.
Are you looking for a problem?
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Dad!
What?
Their what?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
It has a broken leg!
No.
No.
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Ian.  It's guano.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Are you sure?
There you are.  Out you come.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
Oh, shit.
Constantly sick.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
Do you see anything?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
And scary.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Faster, faster!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Tim, are you okay?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You're married?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Can't you stop these things?!
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
Oh, I hate the other kind.
What works?
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
I hate trees!
They don't bother me.
I'm a hacker!
What?
Hello?
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
What about that other guy?
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
What's going on?
What?
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Where do you live?
What is it really?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
It's what I'm paid to do.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I did not realize it was obligatory.
I do.
I've never seen you here before.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
And you ...?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
I'll bear that in mind.
What did she say?
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
It's gone out so quickly?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
This is filed incorrectly!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
What have you got there?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Compassion.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
-- Yes.
Oh no, I don't think --
What about?
Who?
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
What? This?
-- OK?
What're you gonna do next?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
What's the matter?
The same as Jane McKenna.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
No.
Mm.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Right back at the start, right?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
OK.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
How is it back there?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Just send me a money order.
John, how are you?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
What's in it?
It's in the report.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Nobody's seen that.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Show.
Will she pick me up after school?
Mom, I mean dad?
C'mon, there's not much difference--
I hate it.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
I don't understand, daddy.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Eight, almost nine years.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
A heavy drinker?
Somewhere in between.
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
You have?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
'Night, Jim.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Yes.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
What?!  She wants what?!
You're sure?
How many onions does it say to use?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
I worry about them.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Your father had been very sick.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
This many?
You could buy them.
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
Ask whatever you will.
And, America?
I am scared.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
Good day.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
True.
Yes.
Ahh.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
It is possible, Holiness.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
You're a beautiful woman.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
You take care.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Eh.  Fuck it.
I'm okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
Oh my God.
It's too dangerous for--
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Like little children.  You okay?
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Calm down.
If I'm ever in New York...
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Not yet.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
I had a great time last night. Again.
That's not what you came to say.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
This is what we do?
Part of our research--
It has nothing to do with--
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No. He won't come after me.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Sometimes.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Who's the subject?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
You seem pretty sure of that.
What would it take?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Sewing...
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
Your bleeding has stopped.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Who killed your patient?
They all were.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Horses - and sheep...
How long did you live there?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
But you could. You did.
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Let us go, miss.
Your "father"?
I'm sorry.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
What is it?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
What?
There was no letter.
Some say that's the way of it.
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Ottawa!
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
Where do we go from here?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Sir!
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
What is enough?
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Why Sixpack?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
You did good...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
We made it!
...I'd really have to show it to you.
And it killed Bo?
Thank you, Martin.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
You read Russian?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Typhoon?!
How'd you do that?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Are you sure you saw something?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Can I help?
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Have you counted the money?
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Right, his leg's going now.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
Who's this fat man, then?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
My van is half full.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
What's left over?'
We need fertilizer, Winston.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
I don't know what the big deal is.
I can't take any more school.
They're not going to jail.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
I do, sir.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
You got a cause of death?
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Yeah, well--
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
What?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I have a B average.
Tanks, huh?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
You lived in the States for a while?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
This place is a gold mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Mikey--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
We should just do it.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
This girl has a child?
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He still living?
And Buddy was one of them.
We have a murder?
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals--
Right. When he was killed.
I never said that.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Not if I can help it.
And my father?
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
She finally got in--
Can I get this?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Morning, Sheriff.
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Field trip?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
So what are we gonna do about this?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Yeah--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You don't need to cuff me.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Otis what?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
My life was too weird for her.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Yes...
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
Harry.
I can be very persuasive.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
What did you find?
Oh Christ.
I wasn't.
Nothing?
Are you sure?
And they all came...
What was that?
No!  No!  No!
Oh God.
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
What makes you so sure?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Go away.
Any movie stars buried here?
I can't let you in.
I want to see Swann face to face.
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
My God.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Where'd you learn that?
For an introduction.
... no...
Nobody's better off this wav!
I got to go.  I'm late.
Have we met before?
Why's that?
What is?
Is he the Puritan?
And?
Two years.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Oh.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Did I scowl at you?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Four.
What happened to your toe?
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
Charlotte?
Why are you crying?
Yes?
Ok, well... I love you.
It's just carpet.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Alright?
Not all that pasta.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello?
It's ok.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Hello?
Hello? Yes?
Sure.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Are you sure you want to stay?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I spaced out.
I can't believe Will killed him.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You'll do it?
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Two negatives always make a positive.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Trick him.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
When's your birthday?
Maybe that's my problem.
What about after?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
It's useless...look at him.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Yeah.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
What's the matter with you?
How're you doin' today?
Taste this.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Hi.
So what do I do?
I don't remember that.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Are you okay?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Nah.
And he's fine, girl.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
What?
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Just wanted to say good game.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
What?
So she's honest.
I don't.
Would you watch the damn road?
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Figures.
None of your business.
Why?
You finish the reading for E-con?
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
What's up?
We're going to get some food.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Least you got your priorities straight.
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Like what?
What?
From basketball.
you woke me up to tell me that?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
We should head over.
Business folks.
We still have to go?
This is just about money, you know that.
I just told you.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Brain and Lung.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
baby, please, please --
For what?
got some coffee brewing, huh?
Yeah.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Please, yes.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
I'm sorry.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
-- you the resident here?
Yes.
Claudia.
What happend, what's going on?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
That's confidential information, little man.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I'm almost done.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
Is it real love?
Well --
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Stay that way.
You mind your own bussines.
Yeah.
Do you wanna sit down?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
She loves you.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Jack.
Hello?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
Around here.
people die.
...this close...
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
What does it look like?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Ok. What's your name?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
You on any medication?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Did your wife find out?
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
All your other fluzzies?
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
You want her right now?
As fast as I can.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
No one else that I know?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Do you have any children with anyone?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I really don't know.
Yes.  What's your name?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
You don't want any water?
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Yeah.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Yeah.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
C'mon, man.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Yes.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
It's not right.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Who does?
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I heard your playing.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is its antidote?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
Continue.
What number, on the first page?
... Two-thirty-seven.
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Shall I leave?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
You mind if I ride with you?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
You set to go -
What the hell happened?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
And who are you?
Are you alright?
What?  Wait a minute -
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Where is he?!!
Captain?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
No...
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
1490...Breckinridge...
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
A bank?
I'm stranded out here.
You don't seem afraid of much.
Where is he?
That's when it happened?
What's the bottom line?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Last two like this we had, you caught.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
What's one way?
Is it weird?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Who is it?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
What'd it say?
What's that?
It's getting late and...
It does, doesn't it?
What?
I'll cover the back.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Not yet.
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
Who is it?
It's me.
No.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you feel privileged?
I don't know...
Do you have it?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
No.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Hi, Linda. ..
Yeah...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
And you said?
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Blue, then.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
No.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Come home with me.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
Huh?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Did you get my card?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
What disadvantage?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Yes.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
I hope you have a second chance...
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
George, I hate sitcoms.
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
We were just trying to push the envelope --
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Five.
Ten.
Cue the commercial!
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Go away.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
What?!?
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
So your name's not Gorsky.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Weird.
What?!
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
Operator.
Give me your phone.
What is he doing?
Right now?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
You -- you're too fast.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Did you believe in them too?
Morpheus, I don't know --
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Got it.
Hello?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What's funny?
What?
Yes.
That I would have to make a choice...
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
I'm coming with you.
It's a city?
Where is it?
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
What do they want?
Why?
Which way?  Which way?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
You're not far from Cypher.
Look fella...this is private...
No, all we got is $40.
Well the guy over there said...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Nah.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Nope...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Wha?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Please take it.
Anything specific?
What is it now?
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Count it.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Friends of yours Michael.
Look who's talking.
Did you speak to the Governor?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
From the Korean War.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
It's for the party, Dad --
Honey --!
...This shit's not bad.
And that?
What do you do that for?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Drew, you're out of line.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
We have an arrangement now.
Why yes, thank you.
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.
Yes.
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
'Just kidding'?
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Certainly, Bill.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe'?
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
She knows you real self?
She knows how she feel.
Don' need you okayin'.
How long you here, Joe?
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you love Drew?
Susan?
Then why are you here, Joe?
She's in a great deal of pain.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I am, too.
No, I'm not.
I don't know who you are.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
'Love will find out the way'.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
When you go, I go.
No --
I guess so.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
That's okay.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
Those were my words, Bill.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Yes.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
I am not a dream.
Speak up, please.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Where are you?  Are you there?
It's enough now.
I think you know --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
About what?
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
Hi, Bill --
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Do you love Drew?
You mean like you loved Mom?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Bravo.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
What?!
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Where's Joe?
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Where's he going?
What a night.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
What was that?
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I could be her.
Not at all.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
79.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
Well, what then?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
I like your car.
Tell me about her again.
Deals?
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Where is he?
Yeah?
Why would you do that?
Calls himself Dodd.
How?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You tell me.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Thank you.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Why?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Happy now?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Somehow, I'll know!
You probably.							 *
Why would I do that?						    *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Oh, yeah...
I don't know.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
You do.
Okay.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Were you born in Havana?
I insist.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
What do you mean?
When?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
I know.  And now?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Alonzo...
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
To the limit.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Hey, fuck him.
I am asking.  You to me.
What's your take?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Then you should.
Detective Crockett.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
So what do you want?
Yeah.
They had me from the gate.
Where are you?
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Meaning...?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
He's got taxi fare.
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
They wrong?
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Sold. Let's go.
The kids? Why are they...
Yeah.
Two kilos.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Tunnel?
What?
To what?
Dad...I'm...
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
DAD!
Yes...?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Beats working.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
His name?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Peter...
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
Oh, man, there you go again.
A mistake.
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
My God, what the hell are you...?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
Please.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
It worked before...
Ah...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
It bit you.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
But what?
Nothing.
No, what is it?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Misery's Return?
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Could be the weight of the snow.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
They're hauling Misery into court.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
You think he might be missing?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Newspapers?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How do you that.
You won.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
What are you talking about?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
What was the top bid?
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Are you okay?
No.
No.
Why did you phrase it like that?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
She sacrificed herself..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Roger that.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
She must still be on the property.
Do I?
So what do you suggest?
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Krieger.
Talking's good, walking's better.
What happened to Jim?
Where were you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is "they?"
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
You don't think we're going to make it.
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Okay...
Is this the only way?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Youíre in Prague?
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
Now I want you to hold onto it.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
We'll see.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Jack...that's spying.
That's what we do isn't it?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
What?
Thank you, Rose.
Yes.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
I have my eyes open.
I don't know what you mean.
Where's Ma?
Again?
In a month.
He did?
It's temporary.
What'd you do to your hair?
What are you doing here?
You're my father.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Why didn't he call himself?
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
That's it.
I'm making you a steak.
He knew my husband who died.
Stupid yourself.
She was right to leave me.
I'm telling you your life!
To the bed.
I can't believe what is happening.
I was dead.
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
You ruined my life.
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
So. Where are we sitting?
I'm here!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Maybe you're right.
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
This is a good suit.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
So we'll sell the house.
Where's pop?
Do you love him, Loretta?
What about the moon?
Oh.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
I know.
You should think about this.
Don't fight.
It's late.
Maybe I should go?
I don't know.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
I'm a housewife.
You knew that man?
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
That's my house.
My God, it's a mansion!
He's a plumber.
Oh.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Get away!
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Please!
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Britons.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
Come on then.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
What?
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
Too late.
What?
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
I'm getting better!
What is your name?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is your quest?
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
They cost fifty pounds each!
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Sir Galahad!
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
You've come to rescue me?
I didn't.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
What?
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
What are you doing?!
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
What's this?
You should have someone look after you.
It's what the maids are for.
What's your name?
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Gesture?
It is quite late enough.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
We --
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
I need a man who knows where I am.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Awaiting my orders.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I'm fine.
It's nothing.
Oh.
Then I envy yo.
Aye.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
Ma'am.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
To keep out the cold.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
So?
Who?
Dear oh dear.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
What is he doing there?
Well?
How long has he been this sick?
I have a letter, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Nick...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person.  Now.
No way.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
No I'm not...
You got the schematics?
Dante's Inferno.
Put in a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
You don't get it, do you?
What?
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
Shit...
I know.
It's the wrong way!
Is that your question?
That's impossible.
Cool.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
One.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
... What??
Well, I ...
A car ... a car accident.
Very pleased to meet you.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I think I've been hurt.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Unh, unh.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
No. Just the coffee.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
But I want to.
Betty Elms.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Yeah, they showed me
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
How long till the room fills ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
What was that ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
What's next Walt ?
What ?
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
What's wrong ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
I am thirty two.
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Maybe you should get over fears.
Look ! Look !
Was that the Old Man ?
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Thank you.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Do you want to go out with me ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
How's your foot ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
What happened to Shelly?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Sure am, who are you?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
You are?
More than anything in the world.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Hi.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Vada?
Thanks....
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Boyfriend?
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Give it to me!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
Never heard of her.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Something wrong?
You couldn't?
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Hey! Oh look.
Let me hold him.
No.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Stiffs??
You don't like it?
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, how do you mean?
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Here?
What are you wearing?
Dad?
Of course not.
I love this guy! 
What?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
I like the freak show.
What are you doing.
Why not?
What was my mama like?
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
How much does it cost?
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No....
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Who's winning?
Hi.
No, I'm divorced.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I won, I won!!!
I'm allergic to it.
Uh huh.
Oh great!
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Uh huh.
No.
Where's your bike?
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Hey, where does it say that?
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Pacifist!
Go???
Got it!
Come on, let's go.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
I have a suggestion...
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I was devastated.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I never want to go through this again.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Ex-cuse me?
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
W...
What's the sec...
I never eat when I'm serene.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
You miss her, huh?
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Where did we first hear th...
No accents today.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
What is that sup...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
... I'm partial to the tight end.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Is there food?
Barnett?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
That's what he wants.
What's he running for?
Where are you going?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Mr. Green?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
You know anything about the stations here?
No.
Parts.
What year?
Oh... Well.
I don't know his first name.
I don't think so.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
I'm not sure. Where?
Well...How have you been?
Doesn't it have a name?
I can't.
I'm not sure.
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
Linnea?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
You're not.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Come on.
Hi.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
You go to school together?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Where are you from?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You serious?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
More or less.
Yes you are.
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Divine intervention.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
No.
And they made the first move?
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
That's the way of the world.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
That's my opinion.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Wayne Gayle.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Used to be. On the railroad.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
She done moved to Detroit.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Yeah, I been there.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
You work around town?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
They must work on the section gang.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
What d'you mean?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Hi.
Well, what d'you think?
You know how to box?
I don't want to hurt you.
Don't, Duff.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
You will.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
I don't think that'll happen.
Where' you goin'?
Good-bye, Frankie.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Come back some other time, will you?
Okay.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Don't look like there's a right way.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
You hate Raoul?
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You ran without us.
You've got your orders.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
How's the ice break?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
You're late.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
I thought you already left.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
What is it?
Couple of months.
What about before that?
I'm going in.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
My God... these people are insane.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah, I know.
Right. 7:30.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Bridgework?
Cuuuute!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
Hidden camera.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
How many times have I fired her?
A flack jacket.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
That's your story!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Do you remember high school?
Is that true?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
You're twenty-three years old!
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
wasn't even thinking about-
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
I know.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Our penguin, right?
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
That is so sad --
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
By name.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I know.
Taste it.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
What are you doing here?
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
It's gone now.
Jess?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Mom?
Can't it wait till morning?
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
You did it the other night.
What are these, beauty marks?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
It's over.  It's over.
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
With Hypnocyl?
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I can't believe I just did that.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Your dreams?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
A sad choice.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Are you busy tonight?
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
This is the place.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I have thought about you.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Well, get a message through to him too.
With a goat playing a violin.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
I thought I'd give it to you.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Excuse me.
Yup.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
What?
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Any bit in particular?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
No, it doesn't.
So I get the brownie?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Well?
Hello.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Two?  That's it?
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
I wouldn't go outside.
Was it you?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Yes.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
No, Miss Ratched...
Yes, that is correct.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
Will you come with me, please.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
What for?
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
That's it! We made it!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
You men remain seated!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
That's okay, kid...
O-o-o-oh...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
A bus?
Wait a minute...
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let me get on your shoulders.
They must be up there!
It's the questions she asks.
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Martini!
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Don't you have any clubs?
Big king, too bad...
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Poker!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
That's correct, Doc ...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
Oh, yeah?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Oh, yeah...
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
What?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
He's dead.
Your mother.
Why?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
You're sure...
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Hi there...
My name's 
Damon Bradley...
If it's any of your business, yes.
Why are you asking me this?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
I'd really rather not say.
And she's a knock-out, too.
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
Yeah.
Hi.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
There's no such thing.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Tonight?
Sure.
Oh, hello.
How about the other one?  His friend.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
So, what's your point?
Is he married?
Is he gay?
So?...
What about your job?
You don't have a passport.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
What are you doing?
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Ah ha!...
You expecting somebody you know?
Sure you did.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
I meant about my idea.
Hi.  Where've you been?
...and a fortune teller.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Maybe I can change him.
Yup.
So...
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
What about Larry?
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Oh.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
I came after the woman I love.
I have to talk to her.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Mania.
Right now?
Sure we keep records!
Well, where are they?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
What the hell!!!
Wow... .
Why Edie, I—
Father Barry.
Man, you were a mess!
I can get home all right from here—
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
How do you like that one?
I don't know.
No thanks... .
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
And if you don't?
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
What for?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
I've been sittin' in the church.
You?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Edie.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Where you goin'?
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
What did you say?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
Listen, this ain't for publication.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Forty-five bills.
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
What can we do?
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
He called the day he escaped.
You're good.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
I don't know where he is.
It's Richard Ripley.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
How long you talk to her?
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
You ever wear one of these?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
You comfy?
You don't seem all that scared.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Nothing.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
How'd you get this number?
How do we do that?
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Don't leave me.
A girl.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
She did, huh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
So she did help you?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
Islamic.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
I remember you now.  Shit.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Right now, son.
You like to sit down?
He said he stayed here last November.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Technically.  They're separated.
He's about to.
You used to like it.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
"Hey, yourself."
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I didn't have time.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
We have a problem here?
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You liked that?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
They ready, Earl?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
I'm out of ammo!
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
You were more like brothers.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
What's your name?
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
What?...
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Learn English, then!
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
They're waiting. Come on.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
That's disgusting!
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
He's trying.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
How'd you know about that?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Terry! Slow down.
But I'm remembering the future.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
It's Charlie!
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Thank God for that.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
I closed my Christmas club.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Sort of.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Don't eat the red ones.
What's up?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
What a great kite.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Wbat're you talking about?
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Will you take of f your blouse?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
What's the matter?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
What?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
It's weird...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
What was the file name?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Close the law book.
No.
Maybe you should think about it.
What's that mean?!
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
My lover and I.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
No.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Really?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Objection!
Uh.... No. Not really.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
I might.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Going on... like...?
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
What whispers?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
They're coming.
As fast as you can.
You barely know them.
Not sure. Ten?
Hey.
Didn't bite.
Let's wait on the power cells.
I never said I was.
Smoke screen for what?
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
SULEIMAN!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
...then we saw this.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Very big beads.
I'd rather piss glass.
Said "looks clear."
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Where does the river lead?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Hmph.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
What signal?
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
How so?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
Of course.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Listen-
We can't.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
This is his assertion.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Youse so fucked up man.
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Where's Lerner?
And you, do you believe?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
What we got here a crusader?
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Merle?
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't know.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Would you mind?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
Much too late.
You tried to run away.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
What time is it?
Dance? Tonight?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
They're going to arrest me.
Well?
Frozen.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
You were there when I last saw him.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Sometimes.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
So you're not a cop.
Where?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Time for a little chat?
I wouldn't know.
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
Mitchell was too drunk.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
What are you doing here?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Was that about the right angle?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
What about me?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
I don't understand.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Ye have, have ye?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Not too far, I hope.
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
It's kind of you to see me.
It's fine, thank you.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Shall we go?
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.
Attributed?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Damn.  They're early.
Who?
I have to be up early. 
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Not yet you know any of these people?
Bastard.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
That's enough of that.
Hold those rights.
Still in love?
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
I'm waiting for your mother.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
She said that?
It was last year.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
One shot stopping.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
What's this?
We're wasting time.
I can't do this.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Why should I?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
The hell are they?!
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Tyler, put the gun down.
Bye.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
Thanks.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
You're looking well, Dutch.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
You've got a lot of nerve.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
The price just went up to ten.
You're not from L.A., huh?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
It pays.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
For the whole night?
I never joke about money.
What's your name, lover.
Do you plan everything?
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Of course.  How much?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
What id we run into someone I know?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Fuck off.
Business.
I didn't think so.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
What's up, where you going?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Edward, did you hear me?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
Niece?
I got a dress.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you would use your--
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Are you looking for something in particular?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Get out!
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I will never doubt again.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
What do I do?
-- what? --
Have you any money?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
You want me to read this or not?
Who gets Humperdinck?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
Who won? How did it end?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Where's Fezzik?
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
And what is that?
Get used to disappointment.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Morons.
I'm not listening.
An hour.
A little bit.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
I have hurt your feelings.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Well, sir, it seems ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Help!
Yes, what?
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Maybe it's not true!
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
By the sacred memory...
Nietzche...
Heil you know who!
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
No.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Or arrived with her.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
What?
Not at all!
Must've needed it.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She stole some money.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Did he say anything about my sister?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What thing?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
She haven't even called you?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Arbogast said...
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Does that mean we can't...
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
What is it?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
Why not?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Is your time so empty?
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Why don't you go away?
Alright, Miss... 
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Please... I'd like to go...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Why?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Mother, please...
Did I?
Did she talk?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Take me down there.
Yes!
What were you dreaming about?
Yes.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Do you know George Winton?
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
I've been dreaming about this.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
You won't die, Rose.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
All right, what do you know?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
What do you think, Brother?
But how would you find him?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
This is my place and you can't have it.
What are they doing, Doll?
Is that all?
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
What did you forget?
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Is anything wrong?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Galley proof.
Galley what?
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
What's the matter with him?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Never again, never again...
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Who cares?
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
What about him?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Follow me.
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
It's our job.
Oh yeah?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
How'd we do?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Do tell.
The gang's all here!
You see that?
They're... around.
I can't do it, Ben.
I can't kill my own father.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
Vader's on that ship.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Lando, grab it!
Good luck.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
What did he say?
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Good shot, Red Two.
What's he saying?
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Oh. Well, yes.
We must have a blow-out.
Oh....Say something.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
You know this earth - this person.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
What a guy
What guy
Free to try and find a game
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Oh no no no no.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
I think it's closed.
...I suppose.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's only temporary.
It's okay.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Is everything all right?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Christ.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
No doctor!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
That's ten bucks.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Bob.
What about for food an' stuff?
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Black market?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
...Screw you.
Makes your breath like garbage.
What was I gonna say?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, Kayo.
Think about it.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Freak luck for sure.
...What?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
See how fast he is -- damn!
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
What?
Don't get mental, man.
I'm thirty myself.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I got whiskey here.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Whatta these guys want?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
So you decided to help him after all?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
What the hell are you doin'?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
How do you know that?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Romeo will answer it?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
I'll not endure him.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Good marrow, father!
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
What?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
That dreamers often lie.
I will follow you.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Well I don't!
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
From Interpol?
Hazard pay...
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I'm a patriate.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
Gregor, is that you?
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Really?
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
What a surprise...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Cigarette?
Coordinate what?
To see a man about a thing.
He says this is their block.
Same thing, isn't it?
What's the difference?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Like Larry or Swede.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Know what?
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
It was at that.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You think?
Right now?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Let's get him out of here...
And now...
Gone.  Destroyed.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
What are you gonna do?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
I don't know...
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I can't do that.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
No.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Dwayne's dead.
It's NOT too late!
Uh huh.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
None of us like it!
Shut up, Jesse.
Whoa, Earl!
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Why does that bother you?
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I've seen him.
What did he buy?
Why?
What do you think about all this?
I guess we can get started.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Don't you have to be here?
Have you known this all along?
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
Shopping here?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
She's not his type.
Why?
Dwayne put the gun down --
You'd do this to me?!
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
You're never getting that much.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Hi ma.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
At least around here it does.
And what happened?
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Yeah.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Oh, you American?
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
No.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
Hello.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Slow down, baby.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
What?
What is it?
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
She saved our lives.
Shhh, my head hurts.
Well we're not friends.
Fine.
No.
How was the sex?
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
What is Mac out?
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Lee!
Yes.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
The Plaza Hotel?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Any leads?
Did you tell Sterling?
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
And that, of course, would be me.
A little.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Stooly.
Stool pigeon.
You want more?
Are you OK?
Want some?
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Any demands yet?
I'm talking about the girl.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
She's fine.
Hello.
Yes.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I still have work to do here.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
I'm not running.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
And in a "V".
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Okay, we'll order out.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Thanks.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
Thank you.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Like her mother.
That's fair.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Six-fifty.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
Of course.
Kind of isolated.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
I'd rather not.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
About a minute...?
I love you.  I love you.
Yes, you!
Well, you do have the dress.
I'm listening.
You're a goddess!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
He's going to be the pastor?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Grandma!
You okay?  I'm closing.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I'm really rooting for this one.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
What is it?
Walter.
What?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Did you talk to him?
Becky?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
But he saw you, right?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Are his folks nice?
How amazing.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
I don't know --
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
What is it?
Write her.
You think so?
What is it?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Fine.  Fine.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Is that what she used to sing?
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Dad!
Jonah!
Okay.
No.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
This conversation is finished.
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
He's ten.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
To the mine?
I'm a fool.
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
Let them take it!
Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Like what?
But honey ...
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
Well, if that's possible ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
No.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Did you see his hair color?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Yeah.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Why not?
Why don't you call the cops?
That's long enough to get out of town.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Like you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
I'm kind of busy.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
Why?
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Oh shit
What?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Finland is a country.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
By not disgracing her memory!
Make me an offer.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Now get talkin'
Cool it. We got business.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Danny, I'm touched.
Thanks for not judging me.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
The Mexicali Boys
What's that smell?
Again, I thank you.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Tom, quit fucking around.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Yes, sir.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
What do you think?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
I wasn't made for this.
It seemed appropriate.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Worked, didn't it?
What about Talbot?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Is it getting worse?
How about I go right, sir?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
There's always a bright side.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
I usually like surprises.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
This evening is over.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
For going to school?
I hope you understand.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
C'mon Lloyd.
Yes.
No, you're not a guy.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
I just had a phone call.
Morning.
I'm fine.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
I made their lives better.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Yeah?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Busy?
Well, not monumentally.
I'll go.
Pardon me?
He does this every year?
No, I'm serious.
Come on.
Yeah.  With potential.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
We'll see.
No, no.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
You told your dad?
Then don't do it.
I'm fine.
Good to know.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Yeah.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Fine Lloyd.
Thanks Lloyd.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
So what's up?
No way.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
It's bad business.
Scherner told me something else about you.
You want these people.
It's good business.
Look -
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
Like this?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Christmas presents.
I didn't do enough.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
He's broken his pattern.
I won't.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
It helped me realize one thing.
What?
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
This is exactly what I don't want.
Go on, untie him.
Two.
She's got guards with her.
He seemed harmless.
You’re the one who got away.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Not good. How you doin?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
You broke my heart.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
That's not the way we play the game.
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
What about rehearsal?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
I hate scary movies.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
What are you talking about?
Do you work for her now?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Who?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
How is that good news?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
They've got her!
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
You used to say that was our strength.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
What?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
None.
Need to get in that building?
Nobody said she was an actor.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Are you sure?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Who the fuck is this?
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
I thought she was dead.
Now that it's out of your system.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
You know that's not true.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
What?
I called my dad.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
I don't know.
I think you have the wrong number.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Who is this?
Popcorn.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
No.
Why do you want to know my name?
That's not what you said.
Don't hang up on me.
I'm getting scared.
No it's not. It was Jason.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Sidney's father?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
Any word on my Dad?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
What is it? Where's Casey?
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Why would she lie about it?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
So who are you?
Can you see me right now?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
...out at the airport...
For about two seconds.
So what's his reason?
There goes my chance with Sid.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
They think it's school-related?
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Thank you.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
How you feeling?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
David... please...
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Just keep leading the way.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
What about sports?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
He's preaching.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
You got to be kidding.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Where's the victory?
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
You know he's fucking us.
Well... what the fuck, man?
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
This painting...
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
It was, I tell you!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
You ain't goin'...
Got a warrant?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
You got any more orders, Captain?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
If there's anything I can do, sir...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
And you think we got a chance to find her?
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
But I just bought a good blanket.
Think she means for us to follow?
You figger Scar means to kill us?
What's that got to do with us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
We got two around that age...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
So, did you sleep good?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
She was old.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You didn't tell her!
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
You did not like the speech?
Lady?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Most interesting.
I have a wonderful new play!
And his ears.
Partners!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Who is she this time?!
Fifty pounds? What for?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
This is a different one.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Your mother, and your father
Your Majesty.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
You have opened the playhouses?
Who is there?
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh--no, no!
I know how to fight!
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Orsino…good name
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
And break her heart and mine?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
A man, my lord?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
In the same fashion as chess.
What?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
What do you think?
I'm only asking what you think.
No, not that.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
That was good.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Looking for you? Yes.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Cover it?
Is this being recorded?
Parked outside?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Did you know --
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
I think you're lying.
You want me to kick it open?
Alex.
No, I don't.
Will you calm down.
Later. But first -- him.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Now you thought of that, not me.
You're frightened.
Alex.
Are you all right?
It's OK. There's no problem.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Who said there were four?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Who have you talked to?
Yes.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
I'm boring?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
Shall I answer it?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
The first one was fine.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Why?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
What?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Gee, that's very serious...
She did?
Wow.
-- What?
Nummers.
You're looking great, baby.
Whatever you say.
What about?
-- Anyway.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
She's a friend of Jill's.
You going to answer it?
Her?
I guess so.
No thanks.
No.
Great.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
What sort of references do you have?
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
Great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
No.
George...
No! Don't! Please!
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Jackie, can we --
You were great.
Why?
Why?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
You're going to kill me.
What with?
-- Oh yeah.
-- please, please forgive me...
What're you talking about?
Where?
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Honey, what happened?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Okay.
Ha, ha.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Yes.
Yes.
I wish you'd go now.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
It's good you want to do something, George.
When?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
What about, tonight?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Godammit, George...
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Did they have something against me?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
You're home.
I'll call you back.
And?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
No.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
-- you phony asshole --
Fine.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
Well, you know what I mean.
He does?
What?
Didn't you have any panties on?
Sort of.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're kidding.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- there's not much room --
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Call me Les.
I guess so.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
No I ain't.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Do I have to?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
He's still asleep.
Get him out of here?
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
I'm intrigued.
Hi.
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Lowe's car-?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
What's the money for?
What's that?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Your mom's not around, is she?
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
A tracer. You'll like it.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I told you!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY SPIRIT
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
How are you doing.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What did who say?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Oh my! 
Hold on.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Chops?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
What is it, Mary?
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
It's true -- I know her.
I knew that.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
She's a pro.
Is there any syrup?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
What?
What did He say?
Your name?
Very well.
You were unhappy?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Are you talking about me?
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
No!  No!  I can't do this!
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Really catching on.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Oh?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
I've got to go.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
We're looking for Mike.
Not... totally.
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She's gettin' away!
A sweater.
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Peace on Earth.
It's better than ice cream.
Yes?
She's... she's a nun.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
No bleeding.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
Stains of blood.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
May we look at them now?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
What is that you wear?
I'm sure I don't know.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
The Western Woods.
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
What is it?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Why... why are you like this?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
What now?
He has proposed to me twice.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
These scars.  How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
I insist that you have it.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
Must I hear this?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Ichabod...
Yes, actually.
I know you saw me.
What... what are you doing?
She did not do it... please listen...
No.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
All right then.
What you got that's good to eat?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You know what, by God?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
I ain't sure.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
Do you like to play football?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
I don't reckon I know.
It was alive?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I reckon.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
No thank you.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Signs?
Will he be supervised?
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
American literature. What else?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Slow down, huh?
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
I'm all ears.
She probably died.
Like what?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
You what?
Why don't you open it and find out?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Lovely.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
It's for you.
Huh?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Thanks for the tip.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
You going to sit here all day?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Not a one.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Yeah? And why is that?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Mostly what.
Of course. Where else?
Here and there. Around.
Is your father an artist?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Where did you get that thing?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Why don't you go to the police?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
What time did you get to bed last night?
You work too hard, you know that?
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
It wasn't my fault.
No wonder he was angry.
I'm not going to do it.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Sure, anything's poss...
Can I say something, here?
Are you absol...
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Are these your bags?
Funny?  In what way?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
You mean it's a girls' band?
You don't see any blood?
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Down, Daphne!
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
What happened?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
Oh, he does!
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Jerry - there's another problem.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
Isn't that ridiculous?
You got some?
We better have a drink first.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Yeah - Josephine.
We don't have to run.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Thirty-four.
We could dye our hair.
Wanna bet?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Goodbye?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
We got it second-hand.
Put it here.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
Yeah.
What's in Florida?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
My fault.
I wish you'd make sure.
Why?
Not very likely.
How's the stock market?
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
Oh?
Oh - in here.
Look at all that silverware.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
They just sort of leave me cold.
Mineral baths - now really!
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
I know.  Every time!
I never join nothin'.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Why?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
And who runs it?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Not for a dog.
No, count it, anyway.
You stand on your tiptoes.
A weekend?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
Yes.
Come on.
Oh, no. He told you.
Hi, kiddo.
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
You could? How?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
David Lee...
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Well, looka here...
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
They gone to the field...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Sunday...
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
I don't look like no possum!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Ready to go, Mama!
Can't sleep?
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Good night, Mama...
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Whatcha wanta order?
Tired.
I just got out here!
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
What... are you?
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
What is this?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Suck my balls.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
You've got a stupid accent too.
I don't know.
Viva la Resistance.
May I?
Ber dada!
Uhh...
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
We can't leave without you!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Stan!
Oh.
We must take action on this immediately.
How is the children's progress?
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
What's going on Terrance?
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
Hey, relax guy!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
Jesus, come on!
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Barnes?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Oh my God.  What happened?
What do you mean?  What happened!
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Carlo!
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
How is it looking, Mac?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Sorry about your loss.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Need some advice, huh.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What's it look like to you?
Don't say that about my mom!
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
You got a better offer?
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
Hello, mom?
Don't tell me, John.
Cool!
Who's there!
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Junior who?
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
What if he wants to get out?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
Uh...over easy.
Do you know where they're taking him?
I'd rather you didn't.
No, I'm fascinated.
Plan B is your dad.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
Why not?
I feel sick.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
What about plan C?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I can't see...
Back away then.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Nice work, Captain sir.
What if it attacks?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Forty yards.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Anything else?
Maybe older --
It doesn't make any sense.
I think I do.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
Going active.
Can you open that panel?
What caused it?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
What's the message?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
She's not gonna know.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Look at this.
They switched us over.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
What?
Beth --
Four days?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Manifested?
A synthetic opium analogue.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
How long does it last?
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
The sphere looks different.
What do you mean, different?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
He can't manifest.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
What are you looking for?
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
In time for what?
We can refuse to talk.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Is it coming from our own computer?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
I don't follow you.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
... you there?  Norman?
Harry?
Her suit's gone.
Wisconsin?
We're never gonna make it.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What does Norman already know?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
Captain who?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
You've heard of me?
What report?
You mean a picture?
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
No, not anymore.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
You mean I generate an energy field?
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
They'll find its weakness.
No!...
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I read you sir.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
What an honor...
Something... I've got...you don't.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Your father will never let you.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Well, whad'ya know...
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Funny...
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
How do I know if this is love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
You don't look very happy to see me.
...I'm sorry.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Well, see ya.
Way to go, amigo !
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I won't quit !
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Best in the Fleet !
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
Can you walk ?
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir...
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Programming ready?
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
What answers?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Sure plan to.
The people in New Hampshire.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...such a pleasant sound.
You'd know better'n me.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<u>Yes</u>...
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What are you doing down there?
You like kids?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Later on.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
What would you do with it, the printshop...
You'd do the newspaper right here.
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Lookit that, up already.
Drama Group?
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
What is it, a surprise?
Yes, that's right.
I wasn't doing business.
No.  Don't tell me that.
What?
Wat...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
Fifteen hands.
This horse is booked.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
She wasn't in the...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
Isn't he...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I don't eat vegetables.
Tell it with...
I've always seen that.
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Aren't you ever in school?
The Mayor's outside.
You have no right to...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Oh.
Yeah.
What...?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...yes...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
I'll put the, in your r...
Why not?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Where you off to?
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Later for you, pal.
My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Town's out of lilacs.
I can't find the writer.
Not now.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
We're out of money.
Grace...
I want to make a good film.
I can't.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
You didn't see it...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
<u>Stop</u>...
That's what I said.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
He's got a gift for fiction.
Yeah?
Wally...?
Do something.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
And we're glad to have you here...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Where are we?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
I don't care.
It happens.
So why are you asking me?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
I'll miss you so much.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
She still packing for her trip?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
So you're okay.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Planning on getting --
I'm worried.
Our children.
Called him.  We set an ap...
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
What did you do?
...in.
I need practice.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You feeling all right?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Did I hear the word...
You bet you are.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Can I look at the pictures?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Is that what he told you?
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
Thanks for coming out.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
No, there isn't.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
For what?
I trust you of course I do but --
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Well, they will be.
Out! Leave the table!
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Thank you.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Really? How many?
It was God's will.
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
This is definitely better.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
We're not ready!
Sure!...
Was anyone in my room today?
Is everything OK?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
The same.
The same. Same as what?
Scooby?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
You have beautiful skin.
Again!!
No, not really.
OK.
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Anything I might know about?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Yeah, sure.
OK. Bye.
Doubt it.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What do you think?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
How's the arm?
Where does it lead?
You're going to pay for this...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Thank you, Admiral.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Go back to sleep, baby.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Suppose that were the case?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
To peace on earth, Major.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
General, stick to the point, please.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
A through H is correct.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Roger.
They must have made a visual contact.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Primary circuit is live.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead.
I don't get you, King.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Let me check.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Yeah, I guess.
Mm-hm.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Responsibility, progress.
No I quit.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Right now?
Don't let 'em fight.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
That sounds so depressing.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
She's in the van.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Hey, man.
Am I fucking him?
In what way?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
No, but I heard it was great.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Yeah!
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Come on. Inside.
You rich?
He is.
He is.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Military marching bands.
I'm not a nice guy.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Erica, you coming?
Can you tell me what happened?
He's drunk.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Who were you talking to?
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
What? What'd you do?
What'd you do?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
No.
That's right.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Please?
You could've come over.
Your sure as hell right about that.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It got that close.
New ground?
Mm-hm.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
You do.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Where are you going?
Wait. What, what are you saying?
No, it's not...
So how's college?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Like songs?
Yeah, really.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Look, get down off my property.
Get off my property!
Get off my roof!
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
So? What's L.A. like?
New York, huh?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
If...
Yep.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Tim?
Oh, How'd she get back?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
What?!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Yeah.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Hannah, we've...
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Now how the hell can I help you?
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
In a deep freeze.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Nothing for Ladd?
Name dropper.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
You forgot this.
I didn't.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
As for instance?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Why should you do that?
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I'll make it short.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Who's who?
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Why did she call me?
No.
Come on, Joe.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
And you'll play Salome?
They'll love it in Pomona.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
What's wrong with It?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Who?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Go away.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Have one of mine.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
Good.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Goodbye.  Norma.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
How come?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
What does it mean?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Why not ?
Is this how?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
She said it wouldn't last.
Just like that?
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
What?
Hmmm?
A little.
I don't want your help.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Oh, no thanks.
Yes.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
What's a tree?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
He's nice.
No, MR. Danvers.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
Shouldnt've done that.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
I knew it!
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You look wonderful.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I didn't --
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Kent!
Well...  Not quite like this.
Sure.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First paycheck?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Uh...
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Hey, boss.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
Anything.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Who is she?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Gus?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
I don't kiss.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
So?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Where were you?
Who ????
Let's go to my place.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Sleep well?
Lois, I really don't see why --
Does she know about it? She's in it!
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
My kind of people.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
You must be freezing.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
An angle?
What's that?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
What I need this for?
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
Bunkers!
What's she doing in California?
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Are there any more at home like you?
What now, my love?
Huh?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Not unless you can fly.
I'm telling you, I was there.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Mr. Romance...
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
You're not going to hit me?
I don't understand.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Enjoyed it?
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Maybe I should get help.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
What...does it turn to?
Say hi to Zoe.
I can help you.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I'll be back around nine.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
It's natural.
They can look forward to that.
Sure.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
I did.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
That's what he said, is it?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
It's for the school bazaar.
From you?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
What's a ditty again?
What's vermin again?
Oh.
I won't lie.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Have they ever been busted?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Is this it?
DADDY!!!
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
No.
No.
What do you remember about the accident?
You're going to blow everyone away.
What took so long?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
She'll move away.
But Charlene...
Will you mind your own business!
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
See my mother?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Can I come out?  No.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Avidly.  He was staring.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
That's no way to talk...
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I didn't do anything!
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Does it hurt?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Excellent.
You will.
We don't have much time.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
And no elbows on the table!
Where you from, David?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Three months.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
What is this, Emmi?
I can't do this. It's not right.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
I don't buy that.
Tough, tough!
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Von der Null?
I'm sorry.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
How can I know such a thing?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Like this bandleader.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Alright, the beige one.
There's so much...
Kyle.
What?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
That's where we're going.
Is this enough?
What's that?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
Hot dogs?
Don't say that.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
A girl.  You know.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Same shit.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
What <u>is</u> your problem?
What are you talking about?
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
What's C.R.S.?
They'll love that.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
What are you doing here?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
Take the picture out.
No!  I'm sick of this...
What is this!?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
What?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Guess you missed it.
I saw them kill him!
Stop talking to them!
Stop talking...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like... where are you from?
Really?
Okay.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?
How do you know?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Really?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
It's different every time.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Is there a room key?
Dinner's in the oven.
Fine.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Look, where is he?!
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
And what kind of sleeper?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
No.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Like she smelled it too?
Are you coming to confess?
It was a stupid thing to do.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Why?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
That's so sad.
I've never had a pedicure before.
Well?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Then what good is he?
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Lookin' good.
CQ what?
Huh?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
This ain't your lot?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
You goin' back inside?
Didn't get it.
You just cooking then?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Not her brand.
Why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
He give me your address.
Tell us about it.
He alive to see this?
What'd your father do?
Up the coast.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
All of what?
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
What's in it?
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
What kind of trouble are you in?
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
I don't.
Hello, Ed.
...Yes?
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Hello, Rachel.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
I don't understand.
Way out of line.
Yeah.
It's OK.
...That's quite a wife you got there.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Just coffee.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
You don't have to--
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
Yeah.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Huh?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
You don't got a headache?
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Ah.
Not an owner.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Sweet Jesus!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Forget it!
Fifteen... what's next?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
What's left of it.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
What happened to them?
How big is the sub-basement?
I smell it.  It's here.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Got my hands full here.
What happened?!
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Yes, I do.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
I don't want to go this way.
What is it?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Margo, you haven't heard?
What?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Maybe not.
You loved him.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
What happened?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
You're not.  Where is it?
What?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
What have we missed?
What music?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
So when are you leaving?
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
You think so?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
I've got to talk to you.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Oh, God.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I know.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Good night, Mother.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
You're the one talking to the walls!
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
See you tomorrow, Truman.
What am I doing here?
Special Agent Scully --
Yes.
Working with?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Of what?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
You've been using me --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Where are you, Mulder?
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
I'd been told as much.
Mulder --
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
How was it contracted?
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
I have. I did. It's done.
Scully...
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
What are you doing?
Where's Scully?
About the conspiracy?
Where is he?
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Sing a song of sixpence.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
...a pocketful of rye.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Peter, okay?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
What difference does it make...?
I need you to find something in the basement...
You're kidding me.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Instead of going into his mind...
What about narcotics?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Den leuten.
Give her some cigarettes.
Do you understand German?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Can I hear you?
Do I...
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
How do you know?
Oh, the usual things...
You can help us.
I said another man was buried in his place.
I don't know.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
I don't want it.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
It wouldn't work.
All right, Calloway. You win.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
Welcome?
What about?
Striptease, sir.
Unwise, Holly...
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Hear the details.
Excuse me!
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Now, hold on.
Yes, it is.
That's all you meant?
What else did he tell you?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
...Mr. Martins?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Where are you staying?
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I'll share something with you.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
One or two kilometers.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
Big?
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
I don't, but...
How come you know all this shit?
You're not in school? What do you do?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Are they still together?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Bigger and better.
Your father??
No.
V'asitem...
What's it about?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
What??!?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
You're lying.
Think about your father. Your sister.
I don't do that.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Steve...
Isn't it true?
Get out of here....
Which one were you aiming at?
Mrs. Moebius.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Who'd you kill?
How did you know they were Jews?
Where do you think you're going?
It's Friday....
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
So what?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
What d'you mean?
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
You know each other?
This is a great pleasure.
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
In a lake.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Jacques!  Johana!
What are you doing here?
Why?
... What's your name again?
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Everything about what?
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Good night.
I'm concentrating.
You look adorable.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
In my apartment?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Please. Will you help me?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Okay, what's the information?
But we're not open on Sundays.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
You know Charlie How-Come?
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
You're too good to me.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
And she waited here for him?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Laurence!
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Are we understood?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Mr Lombard?
Aren’t you curious to know about Friedman?
Sorry?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
My brother hung himself.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Is there anything to understand?
Simplify and damn.
Should I?
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
What do you suggest?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
A criminal?
I’m calling about the puppies.
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
Yeah.
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
On the bed!
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What’s the Ambassador?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
How are you, Jane?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
Piss off!
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
What if it is?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Okay. Recommended...
What happens now?
Anything at all?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
It’s about the puppy. You got the money?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
How’s the boy doing?
I... How long have I been here?
Los Angeles?
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Uh-huh.
Could that be Camden Market?
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Où est passé ton salon?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Of course I am, it's just that...
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
What did they say?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
What's going on?!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
We have to press home the attack!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
And?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
No no, I'm fine, really...
Trial?  What trial??
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Yes.
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
He's feeling wonderful.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Get them out of here!
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Does he have hair?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Yes, it's a miracle.
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
And... what does Jeanne think?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Do you know how to count?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
We... won?!
You don't believe me anymore?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
They won't come anyway.
No.  That was a sword in a field.
So your memory's coming back?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Oh yes... very.
He never says his name.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
A beauty. Who is she?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
What did I tell you?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Calm down, what, what is it?
What?
Funny time to say this.
I haven't seen him.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
You sell anything?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I know.
Otherwise what?
What are you reading?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Pig!
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
What the hell are you doing?
Watch your feet!
Yes, like a cave.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
She looks tired.
Yes, why not.
No, words. You have never heard words?
Wash them again.
She wants to see what you can do.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Oh no, it can't come now.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
What do we do?
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
I'm out, Johnny.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I'll take him anyway.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
You just worry about your end, kid.
What do ya mean?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
She coulda killed me last night.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
You done?
Where you goin'?
All right, when?
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
Yeh, he knows that.
And you were gonna pay me back?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
What's your next step, Nick?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Cheer up, darling.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Any luck?
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
How are you?
Another young man.
I can't.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
Then what are you hiding?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Where did you hit her?
She... she fell over backwards.
Dead?
You see how much we have to say.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Where are you going?
A new invention?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Better get home before it is.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Did you kill her?
Ask him.  I don't know.
No.
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
I didn't know they had a fight.
I see.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Have a shot?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Where were you?
You've said that for weeks.
Chris!
Just what I said I'd do.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
That's my business.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
No.
Is Julia going with you?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
All right - you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
Who's that?
Maybe a drink would help you.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Finished with these?
Is that another Christmas present?
Did I give it to you?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Back to California
Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Smart gal.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Yes.
You're going to drive me crazy!
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Nick Charles here?
You his wife?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
What do you figure it to be?
Maybe I do.
It's a combat action.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Knock it off!
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Oh, that's fun.
They'll shoot us!
SAY IT!
What?
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
X marks the spot.
What does it look like I'm doing?
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Yeah.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
To where?
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
But...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Epps.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Thanks.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
A headache?
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Think we can make it?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Correct.  Origin?
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Permant cortex bond.
4732...?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
Are you all right?
They're watching us now.
It's the end.
I've got it!  Astounding!
What?
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
Where's LUH?
How's the print coming?
What was-? Why...?
Now wait just a fucking-
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Hey, look--
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
How long are we going to stay?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
More metal... sharp edge...
Any word?
Stay here.
I want to work this.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What was it this time?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
So what're we looking for?
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
What's this?
Yes, sir.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
<u>Tonsili!</u>
You've never been in Constantinople?
But--
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
The type they marry.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Gaston Monescu.
What?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Filiba ...
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
What's wrong now?
Too much blue in crimson.
Do you know my first name?
Make it out to cash!
Right!
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Madame.
Talk? About me--about us?
Yes, I would!
On the night table.
Adolph J. Giron.
I don't believe it!
Giron...!
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
I know!
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
I think you'd better go.
Then why did you do it?
No--I'm sorry.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Don't you mean work me?
There's a satellite call for you.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
Is this in any way unclear?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You know somebody?
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
HELP! HELP!!
It is that simple.
A whole ten cents?!
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
I know, I know.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
I'll be right back.
You jump, I jump, right?
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
How'd you ever get away with it?
Good afternoon--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
I don't understand.
Montana?
You'll excuse me. 
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
You're coming back--
I thought you were one of my friends.
Yes--are you?
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Where have you been hiding?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I could see you were pining away--
You can live that down, can't you?
I thought you were a smart guy.
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Not a chance.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
About sixteen hundred.
Say--wait a minute!
How about you?
Hello, young fellow!
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
What's that?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Who won?
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Am I a member of this club?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
What's the matter, Mary?
Well, he has a straw hat--
--And he has sex appeal.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
The country boy's about due.
I wish I could.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Ain't got time.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
Forget it.
But wait, you don't understand-
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
What's wrong, Doc?
How you feeling, Doc?
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Then what do I do?
All right.  Then what?
No.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Praise Jesus!
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
How would you know?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
And I don't even know your full name.
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
'Least they don't scare women.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
Yeah?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
Virgil?
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
I appreciate your time -
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Wait a minute -
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
... Do you have a gun?
Blood or Dutch?
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Sorry I'm late -
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
... And what do you call these?
Stop it!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
I am. What do you want?
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
You have to leave -
Fueled and waiting.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
What the hell is going on?
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
Who is it?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
You okay?
You were in hell?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Not anymore, not in the city.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
I have someone I want you to meet.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Now who are we talking about?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
How many people do you all feed?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Did you have your child at home?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
When did you talk to Harry?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Where is Skip?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah!
What?  What is it?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Hello-o-o...
No, you can't.
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Woody, stop it!!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Woody!  The rocket!
Ha-ha!!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Hey!!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Hey, Slinky?
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
You'll put your clothes here.
I can manage.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Finn -
Everything is gone, now.
What?  What is it?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Hi.
You all right?
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
I don't know.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
...How old are you?
What's that mean?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
Yes, sir!
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's good coke.
Who?
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
Madrigal's alive.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
One question.  How did you find about this?
What is the name of your informant?
I'm aware of that.
My work keeps me young.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I got money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Can you not go yourself.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Come on.
Holding hands?
No, not holding hands.
Easy for you to say.
Smells like it.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Are you getting out much?
Following the game at all?
You take the test?
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
You don't know, do you?
So who else?
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
That's your theory?
He made me lick it.
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Such as?
It's the great outdoors.
No joy yet.
Six weeks.
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Raise shields.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
Oh, God
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is it possible?
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.

Borgus Frat.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I cannot go with you.
I belong here.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Okay, okay...
I want to go to his place.
For what?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Right on the money!
User requests are what computers are for.
Where did you hear that name?
Wrote the...?
So...how's the world of serious science?
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
New guy...
Yori... hey...
We have to get off this beam!
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Okay, Dad.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Helen's going to be pissed.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
I still don't believe it.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Yes what?
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
Yes.
Do you still love your husband?
Yes.
I'm sorry, honey.
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
What is it?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Get going! 
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Worse than Cairo?							*
Were they trying to kill you?					*
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Did you get the letter?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
The letter I sent.
Tell him to look through it.
The oriental.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What are your turn-ons?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Almost four years.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Who and what is a Drexl?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
Is this a joke?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Yeah.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
You got it.
It's great to hear from you.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
I'm a married man.
You goin' out?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Clarence...
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Where'd you go?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
I'm really not very -
What do you want from me?
Keep it.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I give up. Who are you?
What are you talkin' about?
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
But a fuckin' baggie.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Just put it in your purse.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Wake up, Cole.
Him?  You saw that man?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
I need to go now.
Do you know why you're here, James.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Underground.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
Shot!  Who shot you?
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
Just like that?  You were in prison?
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Why are we doing this?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Hey, man...
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
No, thank you.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Harlin around?
Yep.
But he's dead.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Don't look like nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Wrong number.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Thank you, John.
I just drove in this morning.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I have ideas.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Grace . . . Grace?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
You heard me.  Count it out.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
The trunk.  It's locked.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
John Stewart.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
How do you know if you've never tried?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
No.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I'm not rambling.
How do you put a price on murder?
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
That's a bit much.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
All I have in the world.
Darrell giving you problems?
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
What?
Oz.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Not as bad as it looks.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I call the policia.
But, Senor--
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
A lot that means.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
I'm not rambling.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
What happened to your hand?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Great!
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What sign?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
That's right on my way.
I like that about me, beautiful.
What happened to your hand?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Where you headed?
What happens when you lose?
I didn't say it bothered me.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
Like you.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
How do you know he's still not here?
Are there snakes out here?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You love him?
I don't know how.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Hope is a four-letter word.
<u>Jake</u>...
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
The old lady?
But, in particular?
Beck's.
Son of a bitch!
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Oh.
I don't know. It's been a while.
I've come to a decision.
I remember you.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Would you like to try going--
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
I'm not sure.
Think carefully?
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
Skeptical about what?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Just one--
I'm going to work out.
No.
Is that right?
How are you feeling?
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Did you get up from your seat?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Shit and fried eggs.
Mmmm pistols.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
He admit it?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
A sign on him?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
Well, how about it?
Did you kill him?
Yeah, he's in there.
First one I ever killed.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Well, she...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
You ain't like that no more.
Shit.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Did you... did you... ?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
I don't get it.
Keyser Soze
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Goddamnit.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
This is not right.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
I was out of line.
I'11 be alright.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
Three million?
We'll make it.
What-are they speaking?
What about Redfoot?
The answer is no.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
What do you mean I can't see him?
Which is shit.
I'11 find him.
I know he was good.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
Wait a minute.
I don't.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
You're not safe on your own.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
It looks that way.
Say it.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
No.
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I did.
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Just now...
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Dr. Gruber ...
Yes.
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I didn't do it, Mister.
Then why don't you testify?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
This is Miss Costello...?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Laura.
And are they going to get it?
What...?
Why don't you get some rest?
I've got to work.
And it's over...?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Joe...  Joe...
Dr. Gruber.
Are you out of your mind...?
...I'm going to need your help...
...I have to stand up for her...
Right.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
... You saw her?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Hi.
Thank you.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
A single hour.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Should I?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
How often does this happen?
Yes.
Hello?
What for? Who are you?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
You won't have to.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
No, you don't owe me anything.
Tomorrow morning.
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
You can't. You're afraid!
Yes!
I made it.
Some money.
Love me... keep me safe...
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Do you hear anything?
No birds live here.
Here with you.
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
What?!
Take me away from here?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
You've been there before. You've seen it.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Why?
Yes.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Sorry, old man. Work.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
The poor thing....
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Midge!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
What have you been doing?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
How?
Well...
Can we have it by tonight?
Can't do what?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
Don't even start.
What are you talking about?
Are you sure this was an accident?
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
We can't do this.
We have to get going.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
No. I think it's fucked.
I want you to hear me out.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
Who?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
She's still working?
I don't think so Boyd.
He's right.
You said that Boyd.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Nobody knows she's here.
Just do it.
What are you going to do?
Isn't it a little late?
My what?
You're sick.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Nope.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Goosed!
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
The wedding cake check?
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Well it's bad timing.
He is.
He's a moron.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Do you love me?
Seating problems.
Not padded ones.
I'll call them from the road.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Will you please call the chair people?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Well I do.
Nesting?
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
I don't care for him.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
What song?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
What about them?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Never.
Unfortunately ...
Leave us alone, Ramona.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
Is it all right?
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
What are you doing here? Get out.
How much do you want for him?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
I'm afraid.
Yes!
I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
I've seen worse.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
Help me get out of here.
You ready for this?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
My guess is dead.
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
It's the White House.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
Izzat the thing...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
...they sound what?
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
What did Albania ever do to us?
Why is this putz on the air...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
...this's <u>good</u>...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
Oh, Lord....
War's over, Pal. 
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
We're due at Andrews. 
Heavy weather East of here.
My name is Ronald Brean.
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
The War ain't over. 
I saw it on TV.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
See y'at the Finish Line.
Shoes, Hats....
I didn't ask for a dog.
Better.
...by you?
A beret.
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Please, no thanks... 
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
About what?
What brings you out here...
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
...thanks Natalie.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
So what firm you with, pal?
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
How do you know?
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Do you think you're ready?
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Anybody want another drink?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Tony and China?
Then why do you still like her?
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Safety in numbers man.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I started seeing things.
Fine.
Are you humoring me?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Who's that?
Well maybe your wife...
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
I've never even met you.
Your house is so beautiful.
You must think I'm pathetic.
No.  No, I don't.
You should have heard her play.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Jody, no...
Why?
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I guess not.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
It's just us now.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Mmnph.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Unless you need me to come home...
What are you doing here?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
What?
A flare?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
What are you doing?
Norman...
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
How do you know this?
Who did?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Oh God...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
You should have tried harder.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
He made that quite clear, yes.
When did she die...?
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
uh - then he - be just -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
STOP!
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
A girl...?
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
All I meant was -
God knows, I'm intriguing.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
You did that, didn't you...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Your beneficence.
A bit much.    Lucas.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
When could I look round?
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
My names isn't ANGELA...
Sugar?
then why did you marry her -
Why should I?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What's wrong?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Check this out.  Hurry!
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.
So that's a maybe?
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
We miss you. We miss our son.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
You want it in writing?
I miss them, too.
I meant biologically.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
He didn't. He had it built.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Your dad taught you everything.
But you never do.
Well? Where the hell are you?
I'm trembling with excitement.
What about you?
Tell me more.
Not a chance.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Like what?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
You called the cops on us?
As much as possible.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
I told you you could do it.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
What are you doing?
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
What about the blood?
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Take your time.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
I don't know what to say...
The skinny brunette.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
We all have...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Will you do me one favor?
Ray, you heard him...
About a year ago.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
What about witnesses?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Ms. Toller?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
A ride.  You want one?
I say something funny?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
What are you looking at?
Excuse me?
Hi, Mon.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Kelly...
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
And you believe her?
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Just like that?
It doesn't look like it.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Get away from me.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
You mean this thing?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Limestone quarry?
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Well... that, too.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Relax.  We're almost there.
When we find him, he is mine.
I know!  I know!
My hat is off to you, sir.
What is this?  A whole new train?
He calls it the Tarantula.
He's not giving up?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
She's perfectly safe.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
That would be... the Mexican War?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
This is something.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
Willow Ufgood.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You all right?
Fresh goat's milk.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Time to change her diaper.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
What do I need for that?
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Get back here, Rool!
Queen Cherlindrea?
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Maybe milking.
I've seen pictures.
No pistol. Ever.
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Oh? Anything else?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Home.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
There was.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
Where's my baggy pants?
You hear me?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
What about Carter?
Get back in there.
I don't want to stay here.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Yes.
If she?
If any!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Ohhh!
Oh --
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Hickory!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
...Toto, too?
Oh, now?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
Now you're seeing reason.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, my!
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Did I scare you?
To Oz?
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Here -- here --
The other side....
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
And you're going to lead us.
Up!
No?  Now, wait a minute.
...Tin Man!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
That's right.
We do.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
It makes you nervous?
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
I took the initiative.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Who?
He survived?
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
How long has he been with you?
How did you survive?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
You can drop the act, it’s over.
I’m coming with you.
You turned Renard.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
Where’s the sub going?!
Where?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
What??
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
What do you mean, frame-up?
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I can fix it.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Yes it does.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
The scum of the Earth.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
You do everything Yorgi says?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
You can't talk to it?
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
Here we go again.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Dude, what are you doing here?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's so damn funny?
What's this?
What's going on, my friend?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
That was for Anders.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
We all do.
I don't like him being here.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
If necessary.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
You designed this yourself?
What did she do to me?
And I'll never understand terrorists.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
MMMmm!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Will you miss me?
Very....very!
Darling!
Love me?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Nineteen, sir.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Did you hear that strange music??
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
How?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Why?
No, no!  That whole thing!
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Where is he?
Can you play it?
I'm a failure.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
A god?
Oh, Doctor!
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Just passing through the night.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Food!!
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
