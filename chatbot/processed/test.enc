You have my word.  As a gentleman
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
She's not a...
They do to!
Who?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Hi, Joey.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
You set me up.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
But she doesn't want to date.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Why?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
So -- which Dakota you from?
Get out!
How many people go here?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Number one.  She hates smokers
Her favorite uncle
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Hey -- do you mind?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
You and Verona?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Does it matter?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
That's what you want, isn't it?
I just need to lie down for awhile
I know, just let me sleep
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Sure, I do
I hate him.
Maybe.
Then why'd you ask?
Fallacy.
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Wait I...
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
No, Daddy.
Which parts?
You think?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
What's to discuss?
In the microwave.
Have a great time, honey!
Did I have anything to say about it?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
The Judgment is ours!
I don't want you to wait for me.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I have to explore the mainland.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I am listening, my son.
What are you saying?
Thank you.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
What do you read?
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
No, he is here.  Shit...
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
What about back home?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
It was my decision, not his.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
I'm gonna propose.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Pretty.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
What do you want?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Alright.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Tonight.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
Any chance we can do that again?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Hi, I'm Honey.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Did you hear what I said?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Shut up.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
We spent it!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
I'll send a cop back for you.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Yeah?
Sure, what is it?
Yes?
Oh?
That seems very unlikely.
Well, that's something.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
CONTINUED
How many days until you come home?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
That's true.
Five by five, Frank.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're done.  End of story.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Luther was part of the gang?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
You made that move, huh?
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
They saved your ass, convict.
Right, partner.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
What a screw-up.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Doesn't look like it.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
When? How?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Jack, are you okay?
Where is he?
How would you know?
Stall.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
What're you laughing about?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Of course.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
So, just how big was this fare?
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Hi Ma...
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Is that all?
What mission?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Learning language.
Apipoussan!
Here we go again...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Actually only one cell survived..
They just landed in the desert.
Options.
Got it.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I'm not accusing you...
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
... What's going on?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
Mrs. Christian.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
You brought the money?
Excellent.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Is that him?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
... sorry...
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
You enjoy it?
I'm listening.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
Snuff films.
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Pittsburgh?
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
It won't work like that.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
How are you?  Having any luck?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
I don't know.  I think so.
What are you talking about... ?
Who is this... ?
No... no... no...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Do you know what happened to her?
None too discreet, is he?
Okay, I'll take it all.
No, you may not.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
What the hell was that?
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Yeah...I guess.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Since my little girl became a mom...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Are you alright?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
You could train someone else.
What is it?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
I think you're right.
Who with?
What's the running time?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Guaranteed, eh?
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Sun's gettin high.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Like you and Gordon?
In the chest.
On your sleeve.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Yeah.
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
Dad.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
What do I have to do for it?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
I know your parents.
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Take care, Wade.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
You talked to Jack?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
His office. You mean my old office.
Sleeping.
Yeah.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
That's affirmative.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
why did they do that?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Four...
Jim...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Over my dead body.
You'll do it?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
and if that means negotiating...
who can I say is calling?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You give me ulcers.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What?
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Yes I did...
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
Simon, what's happening?!
Maybe.
Negative.
He's a boy dog.
You're sure?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Do you want to talk about it.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Well...not for another two hours.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Elaine!
Ted!
What's his problem?
See them, Elaine?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, Sister?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
In there.
Here?
Let's talk Hubley.
Did you learn anything?
Screw you.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
I believe he is probably lying.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Yes.  That follows.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Hear me out...
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You son of a bitch.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
Sir?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
Now many?
It's game time.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Thanks.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Range twenty meters.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
So what do I tell this guy?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Why not?
You promise?
Cross my heart.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Yes.  A little girl.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Indeed.
His Grace is very angry with you.
No.
Why not?
Oh!
The marriage!
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Oh - excuse me!
Is she a good fuck?
What??
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Humiliated?
Why? People fart backwards.
What?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
No!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
What does she want?
Stanzi!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Come back tonight.
Alone.
But! I'm a married woman!
What?
Be careful!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
May I try it?
And the result satisfies.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
He's here.
Yes.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Yes, thank you, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Where?
Is he working?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Madame.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I can't say. Really
Really? Why?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
How could it not, Excellency?
Who are you?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Do you mean that?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Confutatis Maledictis.
And that's it. Do you have it?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Exactly.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Mozart -
Mozart -
What do you want?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
All Vienna has heard that.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Exactly.
I've seen the manuscript.
Of course.
How did he look?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Yes.
What did he say?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
That's not really a very proper question.
Twenty-eight.
Shall I read to you?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
The kitchen.
Charming.
Yes?
Of course.
The zoo?
No.
He all right?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
There were witnesses?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Well, I like it here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Hello.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Go on, ask them.
What's the plan?
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
I wanted to see you.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
A monster. I know, I know.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Hi, Jack.
Thank you.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I could hang myself.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
Why not?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Why - well, I—
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Mr. Dickson?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Is it safe?
I'm afraid so.
Oh, ten dollars—
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
What time did you get in?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Hands off your hip, Cole.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Still smells fishy.
Strategically.
Another dozen out back.
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered.  From back there.
You know you're welcome any time!
Daddy, don't start with this again.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
That just might work.
You are a charmer.
What do you think?
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
They're making him a hero now.
A fair number, Ma.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Little ones.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Don't turn around.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
I'm not hanged yet.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Thank you.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Good.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Your men knew the risks.
What is that?
This is no game.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Can't you tell me anything?
What is that?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Pick me up?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Is it a what?
What are you doing tonight?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
We should do it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
We need to talk.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
I think you should go now.
Yes, naturally.
SHUT UP!
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Patrick?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
No. Flattering, but no.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
So, what's the topic of discussion?
KIMBALL.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Bad habit.
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Hang...out?
No, he just hung out there.
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
No.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Nothing.
So...you hang out here a lot?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He does? You're sure?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Speak up. Come on.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
...But?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
He's your boss. He's not your --
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Right... What's that mean again?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
We could move 'em up here.
Cool!
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
It's okay. Really.
It scales, don't you think?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
...Worse?
That's great! Thanks.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Okay, #2.
Keep looking.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Come with me.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
He's out of prison?
A what?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
...You got my E-mail?
I met this girl.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
You seem surprised to see me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Good luck, Austin.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Thank you, Exposition.
Excuse me?
What?
Yes Basil?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
What?
Why did you leave so soon?
Fancy a nibble?
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Not in the Nineties.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Does that make you horny?
Likewise.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
Noooooooooooooo!
What are you saying, son?
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Hi.
An evil vet?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
He's asleep.
I'm proud of you.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I just don't see it.
Did you ever want to?
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
And how do you feel about that?
Really?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Red ...
As you see.
Hmmm ...
I resign.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
But -- why?
I'm already married ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Then what's stopping you?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Why should they think that?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
But you did suspect me.
I thought you didn't.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
It's called Black Leather.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Have you any place in mind?
I know all this.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Where?
Are you alright, young man?
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
And...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
No, Cole, I...
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
About what?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Um... that's very relaxing.
You better not have too much joy.
Are you okay?
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
A real turd.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
No, Brett, I...
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Where the hell is he?
Reach out and snort someone.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Saw what?
What are we going to do about this?
You look great.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
You think that's really any of your business?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Then why did you quit?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I'm sorry.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Are you still here?
-- Shhh.
And the putty around the door?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
What reason?
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
No.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Every little boy's fantasy.
What?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
I was ahead of my time.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Firehouse.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
And the world -- the whole world.
I'm working on it.
You don't know... nobody knows...
Don't you have any leads at all?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
This psycho can.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
You don't have the demographics.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
What's wrong with him?
I'm out.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
De-la-croix.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
How much?
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
How different?
Mantan?
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
He never showed it.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Hello.
Which one is your brother?
Who's side are you on?
I thought it was appropiate.
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
This is crazy.
Don't make me have to use this.
Yes, your name?
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
You know how your Daddy is.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
I never had a really real pair before.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
...the big apple, New York, New York.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Oh her.
You don't read, do you?
How did you get this gig?
You leave something out?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
O'Grady.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Who else can give me information about you?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Not even that.
Have you not a man whom you value?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
I see.
Yes?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Can I at least have a drink?
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
You too?
You did Basic here?
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
We don't need the tapes --
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
Do what?
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Where?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Why?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
I... I don't know...
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Well?
Why?
I didn't --
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Move him.
You made me look like an idiot --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Dunbar.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
That bugs you too?
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
For what?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
So you took off your shirt?
We just want --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
It won't work --
What the fuck happened to you --
Tell him to shut up --
So?
We know.
Sir, yes, sir!
Yes!
Bloom like a flower?
How would you describe him?
How old are you?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
No, I understand.
Spooning the sherbet.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
What's your name, Giant?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
So how does it happen?
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Okay.
You owe me three-fifty.
When did you ever work in an office?
I will.
You know where the chemicals are?
I thought you weren't dying.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Dad!
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Like this.
Where are we headed?
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
I don't believe it!
Oh. Oh.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
It's bad.
You need to go.
They met at Auburn.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
Do you love your father?
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
How much time does he have left?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
No I don't.
Say thank you.
What?
I'm asking what you're here for.
I need to know who you are first please.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
What was that?
When?
Tell me what he said.
He wants money.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
What's wrong?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
No I don't.
What?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Get out
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
You know you can come under the blanket.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
It's more like a date.
Is your niece older than 12?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Hi.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
For your hands?
Holy shit.
Sure.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Better than what you give.
YOU SHUT UP!
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Sorry.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
Now, hold up.
How a girl get like that?
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Yes'sir.
Thank you.
What's on your mind?
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
What happened to your face?
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
What are you doing?
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Squid?
Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
You must leave?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Did I say that?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
No.
You did great, Ichiro.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
He's on duty.
Yeah.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
He killed a police officer.
We're police officers.
I want him.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
One man.  He must be good.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Would you like to be modified?
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
We have a lot in common.
Of course not.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
You're our best and only friend.
When?
Six, huh?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
I'm doing okay.
No.  I got a problem.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
Book the good ones for where?
It that mother real?
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
I've already got more help than I need.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Did you cry when your father died?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What's up?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What desert?
A tortoise.  What's that?
What's your name?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Beautiful.
Is that why you're still here?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
How do you do?
I came on a bus.
Right.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
And that's it?
Take it. damn it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
One who's not a mutant.
When do you need her by?
Get out!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
I certainly do!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
What have you ordered?
What?
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
...I do.
Tempus fugit!
What's baseball?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
You have very nice ceilings.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
What?!
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
And thanks for always being happy!
You dial nine to get out.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
You don't look thirty-five.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I do alright.
Yes?
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
What?
All back East.
Yeah.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Yes, dear!
The locks.
You have tranquilizers?
Is there a problem?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Right here!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Calvin!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
We do?
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
He's smart.
Some time.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Alright, I will.
We did not leave together.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Or have perfect table manners.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Oh, no!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
To get some frozen poultry.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
Only you and the photo lab.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
Do you like the way I feel?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
I, uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No.
Who is Don?
Yes.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--
I asked first.
You what?
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He's comin' back? What for?
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
No.
Well.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
What did you see?
He got a little jealous.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Goodnight.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
You want to dance?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead.
What are watchin' this junk for?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?
What are you saying?
What happened?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
We paid attention in school.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
How many?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Nervous?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
So what do you think?
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
So, what do we do now?
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
My, my...
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
What the...?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
The... The funny man.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
I'm lookout.
You think we're going to be chased?
Yeah.
Why not?
You owe me fifty bucks.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Why don't you come with us.
She doesn't need to know.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
I want you to look at this.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Dignan. Take it easy.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
Nobody move!
Help me move him.
Where's Kumar?
He did?
That's a sharp jacket.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
That was a test?
Did Dignan take the test?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Did you ever steal a car before?
See you.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Like silk?
The front stairs.
Is that him?
I don't know about that.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
What are you talking about, Bob?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Where'd she go?
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
What the fuck possessed you?
I don't know.
What do you mean get back?
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Bullshit.
Come on, Bob.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Is he in?
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
Where's that guy going?
Is that your chiquita?
Mr. Henry?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
No. You lost your way.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Pamela Landy?
I'm sorry.
-- where's left to go? --
What?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
I know it's a dream.
I killed him???
Your first assignment was Geneva.
No... Jason... please...
We need to get in there.
Alright... take it down.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Who's this?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
What kind of problems?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Yes. In that order.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
It was in Latin, sir.
We cannot defeat this --
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
You mock us with a smile?
I'll wait... back there.
Rest, William.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Good to see you again.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
A common thief.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
You will die! It will be awful!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
And the bad news?
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
There must be a way to fix this.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Yes.
Are you hurting her?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Different? How?
Yeah?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Which is?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Huh?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Here's to you, sir.
What do you want for Sam?
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
And the carrying charges?
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
I will.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
My German's a little rusty.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
For the last time, put them on the table.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But Richard, no, I, I --
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
It's been a long time.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Goodnight.
Good morning.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
No. It's all arranged.
Yes.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Hello, Louis.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Manages what?
Why two?
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
I have my orders.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Our expenses?
Sacha, she's had enough.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Do too much, I'll die.
Take it.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
You know what happened to this?
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Keep painting.  Promise me.
You?  Personally?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
He is a cute thing.
He's your cute thing.
You can't go now.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
I thought you might have.
If I'd known you were alive --
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
If you say you are.
What happened to your pants?
You what?
But I might not have.
That's why you're a gambling man.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
I braided them.
That's all there is.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
You cook very well!
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Where's Mandalay?
Oh...
You don't miss it?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
It will be okay.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Nothing.
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I never said they were boring.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I thought they might take me.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
A B-24 Liberator.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
So. What should I do now?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
What business is you in, Homer?
It looks like scurvy.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
I told him that you all is sick.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Where do you think you're going?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Silicon Valley?
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
And you have this letter of intent?
This has to happen fast.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
But there were other factors.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Whoa. What?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
I told you, use less powder.
And what about Big Al?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
No.  What's my cut?
What the hell's his problem?
What?
And some new clothes.
He's gone.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
What about...
You tell them the "Tale".
Tick-tock...
Stop waving that thing around.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Stand up.
It's not history.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You guys awake?
What do you want?
That's it?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
My car's in the garage.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Ouch.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I found her in bed with someone.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
Tension. It'll go.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't like it.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Here...use a spoon.
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
How did you hurt your hand?
What happened?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I want you to forget what I said.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
What are you, a cop?
You're talking about complicity.
What happened to Bella?
How many aces are left?
Ever?
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
Key? Key? What is the key?
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
It is intuitively obvious.
Right!
Why don't you have more time?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Not now!
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
No kidding?
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Talk to the bomb.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Move it.
She was there...
Where'd you clip this?
A grand.
I'll make it worth your while.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
What a creep.
You didn't...
Damn... Are you alright?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
What else can we do?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Soon, baby.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Wasn't that hard.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
I won't be staying.
You lost me.
Your basic hodge-podge.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Know where I can find her?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
I think you should go now.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
You're crazy.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Where?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Not right now.
You get it when I get her.
Tell everybody hey.
Catch you back at the wall.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
I'm the victim here.
What happens if you level with her?
And why should she?
What about this?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
We are not stealing my mom's car.
What the fuck!
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Cool.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Oh, hi, mom.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Yeah, you did!
GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Yeah.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
When can I squeeze one out?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Wanna walk me home?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Well...
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What's wrong with you?
Will you please talk to me?
My mom is gone.
People aren't that simple.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
How so?
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Is Callie still around?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
People get hurt.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
If God exists?
Why?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
When will this happen?
Thank you.
I was just being honest.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Christ. Is that an axe?
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
She's alive, sweetie.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
My mom wanted me to have this?
Thank God for bunge cords.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Loretta, don't do that.
I gotta work with these women.
Oh, Amber...
Huh?
Amber...
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
We was robbed.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
This, this... This is bullshit!
What?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Yes...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
You could be quiet.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Loretta, shut it.
Shut it up, Loretta.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
That bitch from...
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Becky was my only shot at state!
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
The king can do to wrong! 
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Then I demand an apology!
She did.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him. 
Sure.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
That's what you think.
No, that wasn't it...
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Uncle, you can't do this!
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Yes.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He fell.  He falls.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
I want him back!
Good morning, Treves.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I don't understand.
Well, yes.
How are you feeling today?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
...Yyes
Yyyess.
Mmmerrick.
The hospital?
Thank you very much.
Oh yes.
The children! May I see?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
The workhouse.
No, he's very upset about something.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
HE'S GONE!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
I said welcome.
Yes.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
We mustn't let him land!
Just give me a hand.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
I'll tell you what...
But it IS! Look!
You don't love ME.
I don't suppose... no...
Well you started it.
Aaagh! Rape!
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
I know!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
She hasn't got any.
Sven!
He hasn't.
You're wasting your time.
I know. I know.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
What?
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
You weren't supposed to see that.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.
I did. You said, things were fine.
How are you today?
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
My name's Clementine, by the way.
That's okay.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Yeah?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
That's scary sounding.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Let me drive you home.
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
I scoured the city for it.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
Naomi, I guess.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
You said...
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah, like that.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Okay.
I love her.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I think we should go.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Says you were a bully...
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
What took you so long?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Your dried cum.
It was snowing.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
What?
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Definitely!
Boo.
Sorry. I just --
You found us okay?
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yup.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
What?
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
That's lovely.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
We can't do this.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Oh, hi.
I know who you are.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
What do you believe in then?
About...
You're political, then?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
What is Debbie's position?
That's Jellybean!
Extraordinary!
How does she like what in bed?
Thanks.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Time to play Spam in the can.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Do you hear it? Right there.
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
This is Weir.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
It's complicated...
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
I don't know...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
What are you talking about?
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Skipper...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
It tastes bad.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
You've got to listen...
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
You got any coffee?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
What is it?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Relax, it's casual.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
It's easy for you to be patient.
I'm worried about you.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Where... where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I though we went over this.
He's not responsive --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
What is that thing?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Sweet.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Feeling better?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben did this?
It's just business.
What are you doing?
Totally.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Well... it's true.
You are a virgin!
No.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
You're a really good kisser.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
What? Are you all right?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Oh. Hi.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Did you get her number?
No. It's too soon.
Hey, Rat.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Who's that?
He is.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Really?
Climax together.
It couldn't be.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Where's Doug?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
What class?
I couldn't make it in time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
If you graduate.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
What's April 16th?
I made a fool of myself.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Naw!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
That's good...
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
What limes?
I want that fucking radio!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
In that case, maybe she can help.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Where are you two going?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Well, it don't look pretty.
We shot a skunk.
We just smeared a skunk.
Scared?
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
We're better off.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Push and twist, it's child proof.
What is this?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
I wouldn't do that, son.
Got 'cha!
Let's wait it out.
Okay, well that's something.
Not without you!!!
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm not lying.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I'm not!
Huh.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Frances.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
An actress.
Right now we have to be practical.
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Really?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Oh, Kurt!
Address?
Are you an actor?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
What?
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Harry.
Quietly.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
The hell you will, Harry York.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
I don't know.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Fine!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
You kill me, Mama.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Don't I know you?
Oh! Are you really?
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
No!
You're kidding.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
You're an outcast.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
People can be kinder than you think.
Come warm yourself if you like.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
I don't know.
Soon?
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Must've been a terrible row.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Have you seen Willie?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Father's so proud.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
I wish to be your wife.
Our decision. Together.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Brother and sister no more.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
They'll hang him all the same.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
I've been preoccupied.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Is that your diagnosis?
What happened up there?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
What is your name?
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Re-configure the leads?
Melvin Belli.
I'll go check on Brenda.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
You know what I said, though.
Claudette...
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Are you wet?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Cowboy.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
What was that?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
What's this guy's problem?
What are you gonna do?
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Come again?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Real McCoy.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
What did you call me?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
About two hours from now.
I'm going for 'em!
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- you got your shower --
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Best in Mexico.
Yeah?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
They're gonna search the van.
This ain't the time, Richard.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
Who's...  Lieuten --
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Oh, really.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Smoke her.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Yes?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Then I suggest we start there.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Just like you would be.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
What?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
They had to kill 'em?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
O'Neil, Jordan.
I don't know.  Seems...
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
Think we can fit up in there?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
What's it to you?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
This is not the place...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Are you sure? How do you know?
We know.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Hello?
It's Raymond.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Just don't.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
God, what an ass.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Yes. Good was done this .....
What's happened?
Oh my god, It's real.
We heard it the first time!
"Go into the cloud! ...
He always has to make the big entrance.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Yes but, we were wondering-
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
How did you come to that conclusion?
Shit! Go!
What?  Up?
Systems register functional.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
No, I'll kill you. .
...Okay
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Jason..
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Right.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Wh... Where are we?
Where?
Do your best, Tommy...
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Because they're coming right at us.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Arnold!
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
No, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What are we going to do?
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Gag on your own invention, then.
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
A grand scheme?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
My God, what?
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else?  From Virginia?
To win this war I need an army.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We're leaving them?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
Just because they are born?
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
In just a second. Two...
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'll find it.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Ray Barboni?
Hello? You there?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Look at me, Ray.
Why would I do that?
Sovereign.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You're an investor, is that it?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
What've you got?
But you work for the casino?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
So what's the problem?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Yeah. That was a good party.
How'd you know I was here?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
For any movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Right. See how your story ends.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Harry... My God...
Why not?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
You seem to feel fine about it.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Let's not be too hasty.
What day is it?
What?
What is it?
What's this?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Like I always say --
The right way and the wrong way.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Don't lie to me!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Coffee.
Lights?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
What do you think?
We hit land.
You killed them.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Of course they did.
Too deep to anchor out there.
How's that?
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
You don't remember?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
You're kidding, right?
What?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Forget it.
Are you the one who left that note?
What do you mean "why"?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Why not?
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Hey - why do you have this?
You call.
I want to "make love" to him.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
I didn't get it either.
Where?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Wow... finally.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
Well, we won't keep you.
Seymour does.
That's not even --
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
That's five hundred dollars.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Do you have any old Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Oh yeah?
Why?
Hi, it's me...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Uh... sure... come in.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
What?
Talk to us about it...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
She's not at home?
Why would she be hiding from me?
Why? What did she tell you?
Did she say that?
What do you mean?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Don't much like them.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
How lucky we are.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Have you ever failed?
Goddammit!
Why?
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Where do you go next?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What are you working on, Egon?
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
I won't.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
I'll do it.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Should we go?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
You were supposed to help me with this.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
What's that?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
This is what you do with your spare time?
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Does it have any favorites?
No, I just thought --
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
That's a violin concerto.
What?
Are you all right?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
All right.  What do you want to do?
On a purely scientific basis.
Who's the stiff?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Can't you tell me now?
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Do you want this body?
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I think it's the food of the future.
In the physical sense.
I want you to have this. 
What is it?
I don't believe in luck.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
I'm not at liberty to say.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I agree.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
No sense worrying about it now.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
What?  What popped in there?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Not yet, dear brother...
That's difficult to say, general.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
Tomorrow?
My troops don't make policy.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Take your hands off me animal!
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Hello.
Yes.
I want to go home.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Yes.
Yes.
You do?
That woman. The older woman.
Where are you meeting this person?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
But you're not enrolled.
Here he comes.
What?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You really will?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Yes.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Are you listening?
What's that?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Could I make one phone call first?
BENJAMIN?
Well here's the purse.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Benjamin?
All right then.
When is he coming back?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
What is wrong with me?
Benjamin?
Thank you.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Why is it?
What?
I want to say something first.
Do you want to?
I'll be up in five minutes.
To tell you?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Are you tired of it?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Do you really want me to?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Right.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Not particularly.
Yes.
I have my reasons.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Braddock -- Braddock?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Well --
About what?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
I will.
Mr. Robinson?
Why?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Dad -- can you listen --
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
Turn 'em up.
It's a short life and a gay one...
You can't.
You might find a bullet through that head...
You're a fool!
He must be very nice.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Reducing?
Free --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Why do you look at me like that?
Strange man...
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
There.
I'll not denounce you.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Yes.
For Vienna?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Don't.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Then you know him?
Yes, quite.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Ready, Kringelein?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
No, Doctor.
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
The Grand Hotel.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Dance then? 
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Please -- please!
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
I'm the stenographer.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
What is this?
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
You're a little too fast.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Definitely off.
Miss Flaemm.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Of course -- of course. 
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
No water -- What a place!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
What you need is some relaxation.
Bobo, no, I --
You ever hear about the oranges?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Roy? He's always crying.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Roy Dillon.
Well, uh... No.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
They knocked out my tooth!
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Myra followed you, huh?
No.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
You must have some money.
You want a drink?
Never.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I want to know everything about you.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Every day in every way.
What?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Where?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
What's that?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Only the real stiffs.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Carter.
My god...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
He found you, didn't he?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Hey, you alright?
The serial killer?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
You're so easy...
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
This is madness, Wynn.
No!!!
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
How short the skirts are.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I wanted to apologize.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
I've considered that.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Fifty years?
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
We got to get another pilot.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Hello.
Man and boy.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
College?
He insults him all the time.
No.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
England?
Dad was never in England?
Mhravitch.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
What's this?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Sir?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Not at all.
Bluh.
Turn around?
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Such as?...
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Sneaking in the back door.
He knows you shattered his violin.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Just one favor.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
He's a child!
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
I've literally got to run!
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
We have, have we?
What brought you back?
You're a son of a bitch.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
The new hero is you.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
You don't know?
And you went home unannounced, too?
I don't care what she wears.
Don't!
No.
A what kind of doctor?
Where will you be?
Don't know.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Everything stays as it is!
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I hate that thing.
Doing what?
That's something I suppose.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Yeah.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What's the matter now?
We made the date three months ago.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I'm amazed.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
It's good.  Let him go.
Yes, we do.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
I just want to ask some questions.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What do you mean?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Joanne?
Tod might know.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Half now, half later.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
Well, what do they know?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Who's paying you?
They are?
Who made it?
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Like what?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
What is it, Jake?
Is Marsha there?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Hey man.
That's not true, Mr...?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Who told you about this?
Well...
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
You ever play Chicken?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Jake'll take care of me.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
You are at the University, Candy?
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
No, no. I just took it.
Okay, lady. Out.
We planted it.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
And what do you do, my dear?
What do you want?
Eh, no. Thank you.
I don't know.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
It's very interesting.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Harold?
We'll come back in the morning.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
What was that?
I like you, Maude.
With God?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Oh.
But they'll put me in jail.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
- end where I began.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I don't care what people say.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
A rough estimate.
And a lot of time.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Then why did you leave?
Why?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
The moment of truth.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Parasite!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Yes... Yes. You look...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
What's the matter with her?
I... I had a visitor.
What?
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
Nonsense, I...
See what??
Is he serious??
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Who wards off demons.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
I knew those men better than you did --
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Out? Out out?
Marco...
A brute.
Who are you?
Nobody escapes us.
Please. Get back into bed.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
Bastard.
Frank --
You're Julia, right?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Later.
A box?
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
All right.
Larry!
Where are you?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
What's wrong?
What?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
You know, you're very beautiful.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Take care, Dad.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Kirsty.
I've forgotten.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Finished?
We're on the Cointreau.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I see.
Oh no?
Your father told me you were working here.
Are you busy after work ?
I'll come back later, huh?
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
What did he ever do to you?
My band.
Isn't it?
No way.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Why not?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Oh.  Okay.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Fine.  That's great.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I always hated this song.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Yeah.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Will you call me?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
You don't ever think about other people?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Hello.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Laura...
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Let's go home.  Okay?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I mean it.
So?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Rob here.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Don't you like that?
It's a great song.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Oh, right.  Alright.
I knew this was going to happen.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Would you remember his name?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Do you play?
Why not?
He was innocent.
No.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
You are being foolish.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No one knows you're here?
You had to do _nothing_!
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
Why are you here?
I didn't kill the watchman.
Not the same.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
There are differences.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Spare me the details.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Stop.
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
I was driven out.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
He told me there could be only one.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Who?
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
You're wrong.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
You're wrong.
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
I want you to come to me.
Do you know what this is?
Do you?
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Who is it?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Hildy! Where's mother?
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.

Where are we going?
How's business, Bruce?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Hildy!
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Sure you can. Come on.
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Please! Will you just --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
We're not interested.
Exclusive? That's great.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Hildy!
Railroad tickets.
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Look at me, Hildy --
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
No, you don't! Walter!
When did you deliver this first?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Walter!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Let's see the money.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
I'll call.
Gus, this --
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
What did you do with her?
There goes another scrub lady.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Here!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Mother!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
The City Sealer's office!
I'll explain it tomorrow!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
That was a googly!
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Pauline's mum got killed.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Bugger off.
Bloody.
You couldn't.
...and four and five...
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Well, for the baby, really.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
Except the servicemen.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
The ideas you get in your head.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
I can't do it. What's the point?
We did the decent thing.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Really, that's a long time.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Drink up, it's party time.
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
I was just wondering.
You shouldn't a done that.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
How awesome?
I like sleep.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Why are we stopping?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Fuck your grandmother.
That's nice.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Huh?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
What are you laughing at?
I resign.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
What'd ya got there?
What do they call you, sweety?
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Oh, you mean on TV.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
No, just a little too old.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Grampa... watch the language.
I don't know. I only saw one.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I always favored the Hulk.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
When you were a little French girl?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Gabby, what is it?
What is it?
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Unnhh.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I want our boy back.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Very well.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
What do you mean?
My brother is discreet.
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Done!
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
My God! The fork! The fork!
Boy, this is good!
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Who is it?
Who from work?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
You are an animal.
Sure. Of course.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Should I come with?
Ooka.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Yes?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
You know what's good for him?
Could be.
Poker's not your game.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
I never saw you do anything else.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Hi. How's business?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Well, we won't.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
Tell her what?
Well, here it's half.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
In the gut, I mean.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
You don't need a drink.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Go to hell.
Is this all we got left?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Aw, Eddie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Findley.
Yeah, sure has.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Have a nice trip.
Fair.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Haven't you opened it?
Give it back to me.
Well, what else does?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Is that a fact?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Are you all right?
You want to find them.
I only protect myself -- !
What do you want?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
There are more this year than last.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I left it at work.
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
About what?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
I don't see anything.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
Why, yes.
What?
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Can't this thing go any faster?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Where are they?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Your son.
We're already over Mach 2!
I don't need it.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
Above American soil?
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Here... now.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
All your life.
Ah, Venice...
The Word of God...
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Yes?
Don't wander off.
How did you get here?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Through the library?
No! Don't Shoot!
I ought to tell you something.
This is intolerable!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Ready?
Who are you?
I'll take the camels.
Where's my father?
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
You will go to palace there.
You don't look very good.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
Siam.
And then they took their children.
A what...?
PET IT??!!
It's starting to let go!
He's afraid of something.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
A fulcrum release lever!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Yes.
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I get it!
Figures...
Arrrgh!
Me.
Yes?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Who are you?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Me? What'd I do?
No.
Kill myself.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
No they won't.
Too late...They want you.
Thanks.
I don't like the sound of that.
Go out, take your first left.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
What am I supposed to do?
What about money?
I'll get in trouble.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What is it?
Which language?
Wait.
Now, where would I be?
Mind your own business.
Get close to them.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
What is it?
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Gimme a minute.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
She is beautiful.
Awwww...
I'll get us out of here.
Doesn't matter.
Oh, I can't.
I'm...scared.
I knew you were trouble.
They have stolen state property.
Rene?
Al Viola.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Don't you want to get out?
Oh....Sure.
What?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Is someone else here?
Wait. What's your name?
You again.
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
You talk to yourself.
You did.
Who do you work for?
Why?
What did you tell them?
You're leaving.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
And Dieter.
And you?
We figure out if it's in here.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Where what?
Hong Kong.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Why not?
Can you?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What did you tell them?
Kiss her you fool.
Riuji?
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Tear it apart?
Yeah? What for?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
I heard them.
That remote control thing?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
We gotta hook up.
Monday.
What? Forget it.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Come again?
You ready...?
Use the bathroom.
Did you say Berman?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
I'm alone on this...
I got perspective.
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
It would be better if he called us.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Lowell.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Who's that?
I know what I have to know.
...but that's as far as I go...
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
Why am I gonna mention your name?
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
The new place? New.
What did you get us?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
What?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
What?
What's happening?!
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
Where you staying now?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Object to the form!
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
What part?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
Triple!
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
We rest, Your Honor.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
I have it.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Marylin! What have I done?
You're vulnerable.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Not yet.
Why would you be here?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Marylin? When did I say...?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Thank you.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She didn't love you?
I want to be your -- your wife.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I know.
Honey, I could sit...
You don't like me?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Miles? You're scaring me.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's blackmail.
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Sweet.
We are. And it's winding down.
Is this a lover?
Miles Massey.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Every week --
So where are you now?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
You're not...
What?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Mm.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
What's Kirshner?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
And she has...?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Miles.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I'll get it annulled.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Oh, no.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
I suppose so.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Yes, sir.
Any others?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Yes.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Beat it! 
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Your ego is colossal.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Outside!
Where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
You! Don't make me laugh.
You might give me a little credit.
What about money?
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
You bet we did.
Eight o'clock tonight.
When does the bus leave?
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Yes—if he is your husband.
Why, he'll be back.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Oh, by the way—what's your name?
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Zeke.  Git!
Yeah. Come on—come on!
What?
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Why—no—
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Keep saying what?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Yeah.
What's it look like, Nick?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
Dave?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
It leads farther than that.
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No, you don't!
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
How many shots you say you heard?
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Who?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Honey, you all right? 
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Post Office.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
No.
Allen Dulles?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Yes.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
More than ten years.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Yes.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What's the problem?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I found out.
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
She knows it's my case?
We are. Don't worry about it.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
What's this?
Take your time.
Fine.
I don't think so.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I'd love one, but not there.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You're not tired of it?
Shit.
I didn't?
What, I couldn't hear you?
'74, I think.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
He told me last night.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
And Annette's it for you?
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Has he hinted around?
That's my job.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Where's the rest of it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Tell him you want to see him?
What do you tell Nicolet?
I didn't use you, Max.
Where're you going?
Wanna go?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
What's her story?
Uh-huh.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
But you didn't do that.
What about me?
Do you think I took some of that money?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Sure.
How long you been with Ordell?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Got some o.j.?
I got a problem...
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
A woman.
How do you know she did that?
What does she think she's gettin?
Where you gonna be during all this?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Four days ago.
How long?
Want a Metrix?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
I lived there for about nine months.
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
You live with him.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
What do I do?
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Guess where I am?
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
An employee I had to let go.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
How much is there?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Did you get it?
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Yes.
You didn't hear?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
I'm alone.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
In a way, yes.
That I gotta see.
Call her, tell her the combination.
It's the next street.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
He ain't here right now.
He's around.
Dream on!
Oh, terrific.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Daddy, what was that noise?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
... I've seen them, too.
I saw Sarah the other day.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
It's freezing.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
I didn't want to wake you.
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
And look what I got.
What's in here?
What's wrong?
Why do you bring her up?
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What the hell are you doin'?
Sam, Tony, come in here.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Remember that.
Why didn't you call me?
Who else were you expecting?
Don't!
Who was that?
Are you out of your mind?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Sit down, Jake.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
You look upset.
I'm not upset.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Mid-town mostly.
WHO ARE YOU?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Well that's good to know.
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Lennox Hospital.
Nothin' much.
Who is?
You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Bring it in.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
I don't have all day, kid.
We're not leaving Crutch!
Minimal.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Can't shut em' down from here.
You see that?
You're a teacher.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
Give me a break! What happened?
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Outta here?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Rizzo?!
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
Well?
That's really funny.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Yuck.
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Robot huh?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
But...I...400 years?
Yes!
You got it.
You got it.
The wire's showing!
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Colorful, isn't he?
What'll I tell the kids?
She's right.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Maybe we can save August...
Who are you?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
What stinks so bad?
What's that?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Wait a minute! I need you.
What day is this?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Christine what?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
This is Quint, Missus.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
What's that supposed to prove?
Let it go, don't waste your time.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Hey Bleek.
I don't know...
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Okay, cool.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We could get back together too.
Yeah. That was me.
What, you mean as friends?
Mine too.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
I know what junk is.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Cool.
No.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Nothing...
Is the baby okay?
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Yeah, like people in love.
What?!
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
You don't say.
So. What's that thing?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
She answered our prayers.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...I said, I like your hair.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
I'm cool.
No it is not!
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Can't hurt.
How much do I owe you?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Now why is that?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
If you say so.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
There's more...
Carrie... stop it.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...never?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
How old you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
What do you want?
He lives on 76th?
78th.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I hate this game.
Who?
Oh. You like her?
Darcy?
Yeah. She's only 13.
So.
You are?
Why not? You stink.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper! Was up kid?
Right here.
Yeah.
What?
Hey.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I'm nervous.
How do you know?
But I'm scared Telly.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
You know what I want to do?
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
One.
What?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
Did you bleed?
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Mine?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
What?!
Four-thirty in the morning?
It's me. Telly.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
You got it on the board.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
What are you talking about?
You think he's dirty?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Hello, Peter.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
I'm just trying to play the game.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
I've figured out the message.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Why did he what?
Uh huh.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Do you like my dad?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You ready?
For what?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
How come you don't stay with them?
Uh huh.
That's a very personal question.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
She could be dead now.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
You sound like my mother.
No.
No.  You were talking about chess.
I'm sorry.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
You.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Well, you're beautiful.
<u>What</u>?
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
Does the Queen live?
The new Queen lives.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
What do you see?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
But you suspect.
You have done it?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Go, join them.
We'll meet you at the inn.
A small house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Would you desert your friends?
Passable, pimple, very passable.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
They'll trample him to death!
He will come for me.
How many did you lose?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
She has the power of vision.
Her name is Death.
Few have survived it.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
No, she was not as beautiful.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
How can you say it?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
...No...
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Huh? Why?
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
I don't accept that.
What?
What would you like us to do?
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Yes.
You're talking to me?
There's no reason.
Show me.
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
You can change.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Shit!  He jumped!
Is that right?
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
What was that?
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
When are you leaving?
I'm walking there Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
What do your friends call you?
Steph.
I need your help.
... My father.
What's your shoe size?
Evening News?
What are my choices?
What do you think I should get?
Sparkling apple cider?
Water?
Water?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Thank you. What time is it?
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Hi!
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
What did they look like?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
How much, do you think?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
You have been lonely?
Where have you been staying?
Where have you been?
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I loved him!
What?
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
No!
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Because they got wet.
Sit down.
Is everything okay?
Was she carrying a weapon?
Yes?
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
It's not my alibi to tell --
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
You have Stromwell.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Don't ask.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
What the hell is that for?
Are you asking me on a date?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Amazing how?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
Always.
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
Grotesque... monstrous...
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Do it now!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
No... I... I need to rest.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Damn them!
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Track the demon to his lair.
Whatever for?
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Wait, Jack.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
The wound is mortal.
I don't... understand.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Mean you to seek him out below?
Never show mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
I've not heard a note out of you.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Go on... go on...
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
How're these?
Sport, indeed.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Where are you going?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Everywhere!  Ow!
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Dead, dead, dead.
And am I not fair?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Up ahead!
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
Why?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
We're not gonna do anything.
Where are you?!
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Maybe...?
Well, I feel better about this now.
Uh huh.
Thanks for the shower.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
I don't know.
To check up on me?
Because I live there.
You're too fucking late.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
How do you become something you're not?
He's got nothing to do with me.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
Where is he?
He never answers.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Where will you live?
Hey, hey!
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
What have you been before today?
Finished or unfinished?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Left you?
Don't move!
Does Alyssa know?
Don't even...I'm there.
What are you talking about?
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
Yeah.
What did you say?
Yes, it is.
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
I'm talking about a haircut.
No, but...
She always said that if you were on the outside...
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Take care of me?
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Don't I know you?
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Oooh...
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
What gave you that idea?
Here I am.
Still got that ten dollars?
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
I know people.
You get ketchup?
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
So?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Mama?
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Where'd you get this?
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
She goes to Parson's, right?
What is it?
Where is he? He's late.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
This is bad, Nicky.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
What's with that guy?
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Please. You got to.
Good idea... kill me.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Basically, yeah.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Hey...
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Why did you do that??!!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
I'm very smart.
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
You felt sad. What's your name?
Later.
No.
I'm afraid to tell you.
What Quad do you live in?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
You know.
And then you killed him, right?
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Of course --
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
They won't believe us.
I'm afraid.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
I hate outside! I hate it!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
No.
Are you ready to put him in?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Listen.
You're a musician?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
As best we can.
I don't know.
Alice...
What's up?
Please tell me.
Repeat that, Bill.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
Yeah, Mack?
I want to see him.
Do you remember?
Who is it?
What is this, Rogoff?
No.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
What's bothering you, Madison?
At your house. Don't you remember?
What's that?
When you didn't come to the club.
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
Let's go home.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Okay.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
At your house. Don't you remember?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
What do you want?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you know about that!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Where is your mad pilot?
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
When was all this?
He amputated his own leg?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Yes, charming.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
What do you want?
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Yes.
Oh George, come on.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
You can't leave, George.
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
The clothes?
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
What do you want him to do?
Why, he's speaking English.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
What the hell...
And if I say yes?
Actually, sir--
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
The radio show?
Jesus...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
He's here to help!?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
So... how'd you hear about this?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Take it.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Why?
Who wanted her little girl back?
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
From where?  D.C.?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Yes, sir.
Lara called me.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
We can't grab it...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Did he close the front door?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Why did you catch that?
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Flaws.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Are you reading my mind right now?
They don't belong to anybody.
Come on!
Sean -- you're not real.
Wanna hear something funny?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
You're not gonna kill me?
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
So you won't help me?
I believe in that system...
You want to bring it down.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Where?
How do I even know which one has it?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Congratulations, sir.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
This your work?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
You mean after he lost your son.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
I can take you down there.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
She's, uh, sleeping.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Your dance is over.
You driving her?
Brooklyn.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
What's the plan?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Nah.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
What about it?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Sorry coach.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Like I said, I don't know.
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Where do you think you're going?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the hell did you do?
What's up?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
I'm pretty sure we do.
What do you have left?
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
He's on the list.
What's up, man.
The videos.
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
You strapped?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Coke?
No, really, mate?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Good morning.
Nah, man...
The Soho Grand?
A lot of Persians?
Sure. You boys want anything?
That money is your per diem.
What?
No. I'll take a strega.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
You know it.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Who the hell are you?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
What for?
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know how.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Why do you ask?
Yes.
I'm not made of glass.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Let some of us come down there.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
You put it very well.
Let me do it then.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
How many you turning out?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
That's right.
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
He told you that?
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
What do you want?
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I don't know shit about you.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
A lot of people are looking for you.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[The what?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Who's he?]
[How do I recognize him.]
[And I had my men ready.]
Yes.
What is it?
You did something on impulse?
Creasy?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
If they like me.
Potential? I don't understand.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
We're taking a different way home.
No.
Did you sleep alright?
Yes.
Did you used to?
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
Could I ask you a question?
That's not a question.
I'm fine.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
No.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[Yes.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
I like him, Mom.
You do?
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I could see she likes you.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Who?
Your son Marty?
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yes, I know.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Please...
Nothing.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Are you kidding?
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
What?
You gonna die without a son.
Marty...
I heard you, Ma.
I don't like her.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
Well...
Tommy!
Wadda you so sore about?
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
You talked to Walt?
What do you want me to do?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
You – must – open – me – up – again?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
The chest-cutter.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
People will talk.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Gimme three.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I think I heard about that.
What for?
Black capsule.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
No, no, that one.
For you, Trapper.
It's in pretty deep.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
The bastards outconned us.
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
I didn't have much choice.
You really say the cutest things.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
No, never in the slightest.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Did you write this?
How much money do you get?
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Oh!
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
The Websters!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
What letter?
Oh.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Where is she?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
The heelots!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
How could he be a fake? 
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Four bits.
Sure.
Well, I don't get it.
Well?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
No.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
What difference does that make?
No, I didn't write it, but—
It's for Ann . . .
She isn't?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
What?
I didn't see anything.
Is there a crowd in the street?
You're my hero.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Automatic.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Hold on a second here.
Being faxed over now.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
For now that's all.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
It rarely has to be done.
Recruited you from where?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
You have to. It's a tradition.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
No.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
I'm not good at lying.
I have two words for you... Seek help.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
When?
You like this place?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
...the hell are you talking about?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you need?
Yes.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
This is how you pick up women --
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
What?
Who?
The woman you're stuck on.
He had access to the keys --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
There was no need to kill her.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
And it meant something.
Sorry?!
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Standard, modern, upscale --
We've got him locked!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
You okay?
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
... Nothing.
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
GET OFF ME!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
What do you mean "basically"?
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
NINJA APE ZORD!
The goddamned bastards.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
You scare me, Charlie.
I had everything. Once.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
I'm already late.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Have you thought about this?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
What the fuck does that mean?
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
And how many soldiers do you have?
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
I found that out.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
They do what I tell 'em.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We can operate around these guys.
And what do you want out of this?
Spare us.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Switch hands.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Tell me what?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
What's the "bad" part?
When'd you get in?
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Mother!
But I was dusting.
What's wrong?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Where to?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
What dame?
Paine.
Waiter!
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
How about getting married?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Diz!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Aw--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
A pet shop?
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
I yield.
Thank you, sir.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
For a *question*.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Mr. President--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Oh, now--
How's Amos, Ma?
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
What's your name?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Tonight.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Why?
Some committee's got it.
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
On paper?
No complaints.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Why?
I also answer to whistles.
It *is* not!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Yay!
Hurray!
"So help me God."
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
I know that.
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Oh, now--that won't do--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Yes--
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Senator Paine.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Order!
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Who's that?
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
He's still pixilated.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Sure. I met you.
What's that?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
You have?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Are you? When?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Good night.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
The guy's balmy.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
How'd you get the picture?
Sure.
Yes.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Oh, yes sir.
He's not home, I tell you!
Your Honor, I object.
Wants to know who the heir is.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
How do you do.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
You're going to New York with us.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
That ought to be fun.
Where is your farm?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
You came home last night - without them.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
How did they threaten you?
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
Ernest, what do you think?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
Do you want to come in?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
What do you do?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
That would explain it.
Martin.
We're going for a walk.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Something's bothering her.
Be specific.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
And this is legitimate therapy?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Mother...
You feel violated?
I am irate!
Will you think about it?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
What'd he say?
Really?
Nah... scotch.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Is that the question?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Uh-huh.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Slash what?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Psych major?
English Lit.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
That was a terrible thing.
Yes... your particular approach.
And then killing your sister.
Goin' somewhere?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Immune from what?
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
And what is he in prison for?
A bright good morning to all.
What are you doing here?
No.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
No... Why?... Should I?
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
You called me your girl?
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Yes?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
That just makes you more gullible.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Except for one little thing.
Our guests are waiting.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Come on, baby!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
He was cute though.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
I'm not that kind of girl.
You're a spy.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
There's just not enough of us.
GET MAD!
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
The who?
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Here you go. 
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
I always knew that you were special.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Do we have to?
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
A glass of champagne, please.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Four o'clock.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
No -- not as a rule.
Yes, I am, sir.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
You must not act impetuously.
Were any of them married?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Open the door.  It's me.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I believe you sent for me.
That's all I can say.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes.
I know.
You could hear them?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Can you give me a drink, please?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
And, where did you see my portrait?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
We have a treaty with Austria.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Come in.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
I don't know!
Stretch it out.
No I'm not.
What you mean talk to her?
You know what he mean, dude.
It's about to work, just come on.
Damn, you got a stalker.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
So.
Blow.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Why didn't she put'em out?
I did.  Is that door locked?
Delivery!
You coming in?
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
What it say?
What is it?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Where's Craig?
Hey.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Where's Craig?
Rancho Cucamonga?
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Elroy, what happen?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
What's he doing here?
What?
San Diego.
Sorry.
Huh?
I need your help.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
Ah.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
This? I've never even fired one.
For what?
Can we go now?
You're out of your mind.
What...?
He's dead?
Is that something precious?
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Are you sure?
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Nods.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
No. Kisses to you.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Fuckin' A.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Where?
Only you.
What gives?
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
I'll bet.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Don't!
You have all sinned!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Amen.
How?
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
John! Don't!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
I'm hungry, John.
Dead.
Up river.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I'll tell.
Nothin'. 
I'll tell you a secret.
All right.
Mister Powell?
Yes; from the first night.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Do you want more children, Willa?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Answer me!
None of your business, Madam.
I been bad!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Miz Cooper!
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Nan, I --
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
What?
Great
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Dead and gone.
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Rod says the sweetest things.
No more fights?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
You should be more careful, Anna.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
You want this?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Which lawyer?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
No, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Yes, it is.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
And what do you do for mankind?
Thank you. Thank you.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
Wounded? How?
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
I didn't follow you.
I always eat here.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
Because we are an odd couple.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Yes.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
How do you do?
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Shhh! Shhh!
Comrades! Good people of France!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Our salute will be a kiss.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
No music.
Is this the wish of the masses?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
You haven't seen her yet?
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
You can't imagine.
Months, Swana.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Now, please, Swana.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
You leave me no choice.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
May I have your bags, madame?
May I ask why?
Yes... leaving immediately.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Son of a bitch.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
I'll bet he would.
McCord? ...
This is June twentieth?
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Mr. President!
Sir?
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
My friends call me "Mister President."
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
How the fuck did you know?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
I beg your pardon --
There's no other choice.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Did you cry when he died?
Looks can be deceiving ...
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
Sir?
Of them.
It makes us human ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Is that the truth?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
This.  Above all.
Because ... I have to relax.
They're all your enemies?
You.  What' you're doing --
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Who else'd be in your truck.
'Predate it.
No ID in her room?
Well what would you call him.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
That's the boy.
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I put it in, Mama.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Odessa.
You can't afford one?
What should I do?
I know where the money is.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
I can't say.
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I don't know.
Didn't mean nothin'.
See about closing.
For what?
I'm sorry.
Waitin' for my wife.
Sugar?
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
I been immobile.
...What do you do?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Could I have that in American?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
Sheriff, I don't...
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Yeah?
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Did you watch it yet?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
No, Del.
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Of course.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
George...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
I'd slap his face.
Where you headed, Betty?
Really?
What's his real name?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Like Rome?
Worse.
You made out alright.
The Five?
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
What are those for?
Does he know you think he's real?
He is real.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
No, that should be more than --
That is so right.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
Half.
We should go.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Where? Where is she?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Oh, five years, give or take.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Her show?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Devil his due.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's good, honey.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
You -
I counted to three, honey.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Zack, we've got to go.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
You're good.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Something tells me you've been here before.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
You what?
Everything was different.
He ask you out for next weekend?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
You hope.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Yeah? Why're you here?
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I'll get it if you want.
God.
Twenty-two years ago.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Stop it!  Stop it!
That's right.
Remember that.
That's your problem.
Get the fuck away from me.
Not that one.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
They won't get hurt.
Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Yeah?
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
That's highly inappropriate.
No fucking way.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
The crowd goes wild.
He's going down.
It doesn't work?!
Yeah.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Why did the chicken cross the road?
I am.  I'm here.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
Well... is it loaded?
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
What the fuck?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Alone...
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Just a kid.
What are you saying?
What?
You don't look alright.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
You couldn't have known.
I know that.
My pleasure, sir.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Perhaps.
Oh?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
When?
Long time.
Not held, just slowed down.
Don't touch him.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Gray.
Put those away.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Yes.
Allman Brothers.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
What say, Louis?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
What do you mean?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
I guess so...but...
Can I have another one?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
You stole my boat.
That boat is my livelihood!
What's in your head, boy?
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
That's right.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
That so?
Now?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
I knew it.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
If I had known --
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
That was before I met one, of course.
To freedom.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Dead serious.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Somewhat.
Where does it make berth?
Not without my effects.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Yes, I have.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
But --
What did you use?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
She says it's not.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Where did he go?
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
A man?
What are you going to do?
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
The big house.
We don't?
What are these?
Why?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
I could go with you.
Who is he?
Argon's private lab.
You saved my life.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
Icky!
Exactly.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Where did you get those letters?
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
I poisoned him.
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
I see.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Fine. Have a seat.
Yale '21, I believe.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Yeah?
Come on, get going, get going!
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Who are you?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
That's a canary, sir.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Right.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
I suppose you know why I came—?
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Me, sir?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
No, sir.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
... Sex.
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
I've got to go ...
But I really should get home.
Oh, George ...
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
No. What?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
No. Of course not.
Rain.
You're not allowed to lie.
What?
Yes.
The other one?
What are you doing?
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Play along?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
He won't notice anyway.
They don't have that kind of potential.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Yes.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What do we do?
Scout?
Yeah ...
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Ooomph?
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Bud?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Oh GOD ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Cool.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
This is "Fly With Us?"
What's the listing?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Please don't.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Yeah I can't.
I have work, I can't leave.
It's fine, but --
Yeah I can't.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Tell me why.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Nothing.
Are you watching a porno movie?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Really? Please?
I need help.
You lied to me?
This is not cool.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
No.
I don't know.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Sure.
Sure.
This is funny.
Alright?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
....No....
There's a better place for us to eat.
Yes? I'm trying.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Have a good trip.
Yes.
...what...?
This is funny.
Yeah.
I forgot about that.
You left me at the hospital.
No.
How?
On my knife.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I didn't do it.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
That's that.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
What's up?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
You have an ATM?
Are you serious with this?
Yes. Sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Seven o'clock.
I won't.
Seriously.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Put him through.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
It's not bad, it's ok.
No.
I don't believe it. The Marquis de Sade? You're actually publishing his novels?
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Yes, Abbe?
In part, yes.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
It's no secret that you loved her.
-- that was lust --
And he's never once attempted escape?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I have.
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Yes?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Did I frighten you?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it awfully violent?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Uh-hub.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Oh, why is that?
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Sir, I-
Huh?
We're using-
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Telling stories.
Nope.
But with compassion and insight--
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Mank-
Sorry to disappoint.
Let me out.
Listen to me-
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
What?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Craig is one syllable
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Hedy Lamarr?
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Mank!
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
CITIZEN KANE
This is an abomination There's no music and--
For Christ's sake, shut up--
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
Oh God. . .
Yes!
They wanna talk to you.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
How can he embarrass you?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
When?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What do you mean, "you"?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
What time is it?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Jake...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Jake...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
Who asked you?
I was just...
I'm not interested in him.
That he's got a pretty face.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
OK. Talk.
Why don't you just call him up?
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Like disposing of their wives?
You think I made all this up?
His wife took a trip.
What time?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Give him evidence.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
But I'm not a killer!
Like an old hambone?
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
I can't. The police have it by now.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
And some man will lose his.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Police?
Huh?
Thank heaven that's over!
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
How much do you think you'll need?
What about the rest?
Mrs. Doyle?
Not yet, Jeff.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Someone not his wife?
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I hate funny exit lines.
Huh?
Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.
Chelsea 2-5598.
What's that?
Meaning me?
Yeah.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You can't protect me.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yeah!  Shh!
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Sorry.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Jim.  What's yours?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
I'm here.
Who knows.  Plato?
I hitched.
Who has?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Man, you're schizoid!
I don't want you for my father!
Plato?
I've got a gun.
Can I keep it?
Plato!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Good Lord!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Wash up and go home.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
What a zoo!
What?
Pretty mixed up?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
See?
Won't mother be proud.
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
They'll be looking for you.
It doesn't matter to them.
You cold?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
What?
You said you'd call my father.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
Gabriel!
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Negative five?
Yeah.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
NO!
No, Nick, no --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Put him in the truck.
Yes!
Hell. Ten?
Why not.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
I can't go back to Vegas...
What?
You want that for here or to go?
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
What, working security?
Jesus, Rudy --
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Seymour Scagnetti.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
You ain't dying, he is.
Where was she from, Compton?
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Me and Mr. White?
A little.
What?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Wong?
Give me this fucking thing.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it.
I know.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
Why?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
I'm okay.
It's not good...
Lie back down, and try to -
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
As opposed to good?
You really think we were set up?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
How can you be so sure?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
I don't know anybody.
Why!
We don't think this place is safe.
Tell them to come on in.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I suppose it is.
I'll make the soap myself.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
It's going to Sonora.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
I found their surrey --
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Go on, hit me.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
What did you come back for?
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Goodbye and thanks.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Because there's a man I want to see.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You were supposed to be reading words.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Are you okay?
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Hey, you left your book back there.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
I know, but I've been thinking --
What should we get?
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Where's Shorty?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
Stop! --
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Let me see the files.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
In about fifteen minutes.
Would you please focus?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
What are you working on?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Father, are you okay?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
What does it say?
Oh, boy! 
Hi!
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
You mean for TV or print?
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Don't I get a kiss?
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Marvin A. Pickles.
You got your wish.
That's like your car, Beverly,
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Are we leaving?
Yeah —- sure.
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
You could go and open the door.
Yes, I understand.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
I haven't got that much in cash.
But tell me --
Why, Mary --
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
I ought to know.
I did her hair.
Nothing.
She showed me a drawing.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
Who the devil is he?
Well?
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I don't think that's so revealing.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I'm at sea, Jason.
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What a peculiar question.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
What?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
I was a great dancer...
Is it about Jacqueline?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
I'll be out in a minute.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
Yes?
Television?
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Oh, uh-huh.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Sister older or younger?
No.
Why is that?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
You had sex with you therapist?
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
This is just... so...
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
It won't. Are you ready?
No.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
But I don't understand --
Who? Elizabeth?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Why not?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Loud.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
When did you begin having this feeling?
God, no.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Why, so you can go after him?
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Fine.
No, I didn't.
No, it's nothing like that.
Yes, I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Why?
It's a sun dress.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Not exactly.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
When I was fourteen.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Prettier than Ann?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
I would.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Hello.
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
Plenty of room for two people.
Everybody has a past.
No.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Give me your keys.
Mr. Millaney?
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Hi. Want a drink?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
So who changes?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
Huh?
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
How did you come by this scenario?
Out of self comes selflessness.
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Poor Brad.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
. . .For his own good.
F for...
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
WHAT A JOKE...
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Why are you being so defensive?
My condolences.
What are you pouring tonight?
Bottle.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
What happened to you guys?
Hiya.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
I am one of those guys.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
How old's she going to be?
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
And Lexapro, yes.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
It's not even a mile.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Yeah. Tight.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
She is very hot.
Perfect.
She works for tips!
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
What do you think?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Right now.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
What?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
With Maya.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
I don't have to.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
What's up?
What?
We gotta go back.
So what's the plan?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
I'm fine. You rest.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Love you, man.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
What are you drinking?
Hi.
Hey.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Well...
Bathroom over there?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
I had class.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
That was big of him.
So how're you doing?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
About four weeks.
I told you I need a drink.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
This one?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I'm scared.
I don't feel much.
I see.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
It's noise.
Do you feel comforted?
They're distracting us?
It's getting stronger.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
It needs batteries.
Oh.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
It's like War of the Worlds.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
What friend is that?
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Sounds good.
...Gotta go...
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
More than enough.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Goodbye?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Yeah?
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
What's that?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
We'd rather stay.
Why would they stop you?
He must be pretty good.
What about his brother?
I heard that too.
Hello, Cobb.
I've given that up.
I just got to town.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
I don't want you to get hurt.
That was my plan.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
I am telling the truth.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
I'm glad we talked.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
The public decides who's on that list.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Almost right.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
There isn't one.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane.
-- I can explain.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
My two favorite girls.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Not if I don't let her.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Of course.
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Hello, Hal.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
How will you do our love scenes?
Hal, what are you doing?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
-- Please, get away from me.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
You know, I... don't know.
I know plenty of boys.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
How?
Good-night, Daddy.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Don't you?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Why, Malcolm?
You're a doctor. What kind?
No.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Something I want?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Yes.
I have to.
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
No, we're not.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Someone got hurt.
They did?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Yes, Cole?
Stuttering Stanley!
Chuck E. who?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What are you talking about?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Could take a little while, though.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Fuck you.
Hi.
...Hi.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
"With a hack-hack here --"
"And a slash-slash there --"
He means moon shining.
It's time to make amends.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Shit!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Is that right?
About what?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
...no... Mac... p-please...
Someone better tell Mac.
That's not funny.
Grant, where'd you go?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What are you doing?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
Looks like a chipmunk.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Welcome home.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Driving, talking to me...
I give up.
Can I ask you something?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
One to five?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Talk to me.
Go breaker.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Where the hell are you?
Yes, ma'am.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Is your security team armed?
Anything on the Swede?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
D'you talk to'm?
What'd you say?
I am. Yeah.
It's the last place they'd look.
What are you doing here?
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Yeah... Sid?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
I'm working on it.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
True?
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Listen --
He's dead.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Probably.
I don't know.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
When did this happen?
Jesus...
What do you remember?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
What happened to us, exactly?
I think so.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
But we fought.
You... she said I didn't love her.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Claire!
You didn't like him?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
Put it on my account, please.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Urdu and Hindi.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
So it was "love".
No dog.
Let go!
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
It wouldn't work.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
What are you talking about?
Hey.  The neighbors.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Coming to bed?
What?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
Did you hear what I said?
You heard me.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
What about Tommy?
What about when she goes out?
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Even Joey Venza?!
Wasn't your fault.
I asked for the man in charge...
No, I will not step outside.
Why should she come in?
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
How about dinner tonight?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
What, want a glass?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
I know.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
You get mugged or something?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Now tell me you love me.
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
But you like that in a man?
Some prep school thing.
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
The record--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Come on!
Who is it?
How did he get over there?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
My legs are frozen.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
Jawohl.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
So what? There's other women!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
I'll open mine now.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
You want to go?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
What are you going to do?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Go on.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
What did you say?
Ich weiss alles.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
He is.
Target their Bridge.
What do you mean?
This is its current position.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Is she still angry?
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
I get it. I get it.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, this isn't the time.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Antonia?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
But I do have a theory...
Keep her together until I get back.
Captain, are you all right?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
The royal...studs?
Trilithium?
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Will we get another ship?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Nothing. As before.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
David, I don't understand...
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Logic indicates that is the case.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
I'll go...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Sir...?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
The Genesis planet is gone.
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...!
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
What about surface life signs...?
Close... There --
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
May I ask why...?
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
So!  Speak!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Shore leave, Admiral.
Until now.
Wait --
Is that a poem?
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
It's the Genesis Wave!
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
No!
Departing dark side, Regula.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Yours... is... the superior...
Genesis, what's that?
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
They knew just where to hit us.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
... No, sir. It has not.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
That was close --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Heard there was some excitement.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
What do you mean?
Bones, stay here.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Find it?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Like what?
I do not know your name.
So you were at Berkeley.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Where could you take them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You tricked me.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Spock...?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Surely you can be more specific...
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
They did, Admiral.
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
What is our condition?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Sill? What else would I be working with?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
They are my friends.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Sulu Hikaru.
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
There are caves in those mountains.
Jak'tahla?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Why not...?
No one's ever asked me that before.
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
How many?
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Fail-safe?
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Will that stop the tear?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
If it works you mean.
I don't think they believe us.
How long 'til they reach us?
No, we're here to... rescue them.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Can you beam him off?
Why was Data assigned?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Or you could try lying down.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Not yet.
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Isn't it better like this...?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Vulcan?
I believe so.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
I have helm control.
I am the Borg.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
This must be it.
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Were the two of you... involved?
Friends from Cornell...
Captain...?
Port battery, ready sir!
Good luck, sir.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Mr. President.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Specifically of...?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Where IS the conference?
But if she's cloaked...
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
How much time's left of your sentence?
Possibly.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
According to my information, today.
What peace conference?
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Her own father...?
A lie?
Sir?
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
Yes, please continue.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
When was he... created?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Good work. The download?
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
May I have this dance?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Cannon fodder.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
I won't do it.
Captain!
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Thank you, sir...
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Were we always explorers?
Yes.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why are you here?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Yes.
I am.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
I have a purpose.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
What can I do for you folks?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
I understand.
What was your last stop?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Please...
What?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Shit.
I want to try it.
When do you have to be here?
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
The car will stop?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
It's bad.
Yes.
Yes.
On the radio they say it's good.
No. Get in.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
What?
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
Call the police!!
Help me!!!
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Tell him I'm not here.
It was a man though... right?
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Hey, fuck you, man.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
No problem.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Forget it's there.
Faith, call me, okay?
You have to go.  I mean it.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Thanks, Max.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Jesus.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Where's Faith?
Jesus!
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Commissioner Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Your sex life?
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
So the guy's not a sicko.
That's where it gets a little strange.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Where we going?
What is it?
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Tell me.
Why?
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Are we under arrest?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Besides that.
Testa?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
What does the Manager say?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
There seems to be a discrepancy.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
He said it was a clue?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
We have another one.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
Its called insubordination.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
What I do requires confidentiality.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
I was visiting an old college friend.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Don't you touch him.
You are so fucked up.
Yes I do.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Find the feet?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
That's true.
What's that?
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
But why this pattern?
Jaime --
Agent...
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
He's moved on to TV.
Suspect Zero?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
If I owe, I will go.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
So you're the new meat?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Murman!
It's over for you.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
Well, thank you...?
Why? You're not a real man?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
I thought I was going to die.
It does.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything?
Anything.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
You haven't told then, huh?
Could you believe it?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Well, who represents you back east?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
You're a comedian?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
It's not going to well?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Are you on the other line?
Yeah, hold on.
How are you doing?
Yeah.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
It's definitely a step back for me.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Oh no?
You want to hit the town tonight?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Kinda money, huh?
Darwinism at its best.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
What's dumb about it?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Who threw this party, anyway?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Don't call me ever again.
Hello?
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
Tonight, baby.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
I know, but...
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Thanks for clarifying that.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
Nice, baby.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
What?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
How?
He drives a carriage.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
What?
What the fuck..?
What a surprise...
No.
Yes she did.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...Okay, two...
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
I ask for Justice.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
The gun will be there.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
And with prison record.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
What miracles you do for strangers.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
Barzini will move against you first.
Yes.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
I know about what you mean!
Beautiful all over, eh?
That's for you to find out.
Mike!
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Is the hospital covered?
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
They're waiting to see my father.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Michael.
Michael?
I LOVE YOU.
Can you say it?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Oh Michael.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
Until the old man tells me different.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
Send some bodyguards.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I think so.  Detective squad?
How do you do.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Is that good?
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
You know, a primer.
Can you mix a martini?
What?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
You're breaking my ribs!
I played piano in a few places.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
You should watch that!
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
What about Cortina?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Ha. Did he say why?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
What?
Where does Dickie live?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
What?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Randall.
What?
How did you know that?
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
So -- are you travelling under R?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
That's good, isn't it?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
It's okay.
How was it?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
You're such a liar...
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Of course. What happened to your face?
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
You have, yes.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
You like ball games?
My name is Travis.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
What kind of people?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
You must be rich.
What?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
But this is a porno movie.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Well... mostly...
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Could you see anything?
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Stick up?
Well... I guess so.
Listen...
Don't you want to go?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
He looks like a killer.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Why not?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
Cops don't do nothin.
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
You want to work uptown nights?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Your name Sport?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Things got ya down?
Real down.
Like do anything, you know.
Not really.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
What are you doing?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
How'd it go?
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
And why not?
Whoa.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Were we going to get married?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
I don't smoke?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Thanks.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes it does.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
No.  But...
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Dad, I...
... what?
What.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
That's where you live.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
When'd you quit smoking?
Why not?
Well, that's not what they think.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
That was beautiful.
Sit.  Play with me.
What?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
How do you like our little hamlet?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
Oh, I suppose so.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
What?
Morning.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
I wonder if you could tell me...
The little Brenner girl?
How much for the phone calls?
Young woman cut herself.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I know, Mother.
When?
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
What?
No.
Yes.
I don't mind, really.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Sixty...  Oh.
What?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds, sir?
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
When?
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Ouch!
What for?
How do you know Annie?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, but...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
So you didn't go to school together.
No.
But you tore it up.
Yes.
I'd still like to see you.
What do you want ?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
You have a job?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
Are you all right?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
So they united.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
It's so damn quiet out there.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
There we are!
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Birds?
We need them.
Not if they're starting a war.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I've heard of it.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
But this woman -- and her son --
I remember her.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
She's unconscious.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He was a nice horse.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
A doctor?
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
I will not have you use that name to me.
Afraid of what?
I am the best man for the job.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'll not do it, Gray.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
Nearly a year.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
I hate that picture.
I'm looking for my friends.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
I think we should get some support?
Think maybe knives do?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Fucking Zombie.
The scar. Which of you has it?
Erin. It's not your fault.
So you're going to kill him?
It's ok, it's ok...
Guy dressed for Halloween?
You mean Alex.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
No.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Of course, dear.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
I don't know how to thank you.
Naturally I think so.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Oh -- hello--
Just twelve.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Well, how do I know who you are?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
We don't ride with vampires.
Should I run him through?
Good.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
We were gonna grab some food.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Did we have a date tonight?
For what.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
We're getting close...
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You've heard this story before?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
You're cute, Max.
Not impressed, are you?
Well, I...
Star.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Take laddie.
This room is mine.
I was here first.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
You can't let anybody leave!
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Was dark... find a light...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Look, I'm just guessing...
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
I guess you're okay.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
When was the last time you used it?
Four!
What's...
He's dead.
We should sleep in shifts.
He's one of them.
I had an accident.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Where?
What kind of stories?
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Send him away.
Yes.
I won't leave you like this.
Alexander.
Why?
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
That was a foolish thing to do.
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
All right, what is it now?
Admiration?  My my.
I mean... well... affection.
I was not.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You wouldn't believe me.
Good night, David.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
What's it all for?
I did...
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
We don't know.
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
How did you get hurt?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
And you've no idea where he went?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You're his son?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I don't understand...
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
I need to get this letter to someone.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
You're sure?
What? What are you thinking?
No, he didn't.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
How?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
It doesn't look all that different.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Sure.
I'll manage.
Well, good for you.
What?!
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Hey.
What's wrong?
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
Tell me.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Why now, Jimmy?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Yes.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
Give me the keys.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
You think you've found your calling?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
Harlan.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Yeah, you want it?
He said they're charging us with murder.
Eeuww.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We've gone insane.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Hi there!  You alright?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
Never?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
What's so funny?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Check.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Thanks.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Same here again.
I beg your pardon?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Uh, that's okay.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
You what?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Hm?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Meaning?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I think you'd better sit down.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Huh?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Are you all right?
By the way, how's he doing?
He's dead.
Sure.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
But but what about Steve?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shhhhhh!
Oh God.
Eh.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Zorin will eat him alive!
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
What does the letter say?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
What's happened?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Hey. Nice tie.
What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Who the fuck is he?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
How'd you know?
Meet me at base. Over.
Who is he?
What'd she say?
I'll sleep around a little.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
You've got no jurisdiction.
His spiritual mother...
He knows me?
Why should I tell you.
And...
He also said "listen to the water."
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
What'd you expect to hear?
Not no more.
Still after Jimmy?
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
What do you mean?
Sorry.
Jesus. Oil?
I desecrated it?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
How the hell do you know?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
I'm special.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
It's just as I thought.
And now I want you.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
I was, later.
How could you?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
What is he doing?
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Got you here.
What was that?
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
We did it!
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm pinned to the panel.
Skipper, you can't do this!
That's because you don't have any women.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
The girl with the purple fingernails?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Was going.  Now you are.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Yes sir..
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
All right.
Goose is dead.
I don't know...
Would you take me back? Would they?
What to the rebels want?
How'd you find me?
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Eight years.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Any news of Quaid?
Harry!
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Quit while you're ahead.
Do what?
Oh God, Doug.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I love you.
That a problem?
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
No options.
I guess he didn't.
What are you talking about?
She wasn't really my wife.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Aliens built it.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
I gave you?
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Oh my God.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
You're gonna get us hung up.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
So long, cactus!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Somebody paying you to do this?
What?
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Down, honey, down.
Well, what's wrong with it?
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Yeah, geography.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Gimme back my bottle.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
Where?
What, the lunatic who --
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
1530 Rivington Street.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
That's why I hate experts.
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
A fucking wheelchair?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Got any booze in the house?
My mother find you?
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
It's okay. It was always like that.
What do you want?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
-- Roger --
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Is there a golf course around here?
You try that you little monkey.
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Teresa Banks.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
No.
What do you mean?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Where are the Cookies?
You're not mad at me?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
I'm not.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
This afternoon?
I can't tonight.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Laura.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
We're late to get to your mother.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
...tell me about this case.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
Yes.
I do. Yes.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
No.
I'm just an M.D.
...of Anesthesiology?
I'm on the staff of...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Objection!
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
I completely understand...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Thank you...
...that's perfectly all right.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
Ready, your Honor.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Overruled...
Exception!
What Hotel are you staying at?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
It's over!
Mr. Alito, please.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Uh...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Oh shit, what's today?
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
Yes, that's correct.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
How'm I doing so far?
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
They've all stopped at the same time.
It's gone now.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Right.
Must be somebody in there.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I don't follow.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Guess so.
Heather?
Chase, you'd better come home.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Doctor...
no.
Why does God let there be bad things?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Fred Krueger did it.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
You may not like what you hear.
Yes sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Fine.
She isn't that old.
What do you mean?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Congratulations.
Feels different doesn't it?
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
How ya doing?
Who told you that?
Northeast sir!
Sir...?
No.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
And, of course, we are.
What is it we can do for you today?
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
And being sixteen.
We'll think of something.
It matters to me.
Well, that was neighborly.
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
Yes, that's true.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Why? He's right in the groove.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
What's that?
Whattaya mean family?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
But I'm wild at heart.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Why, honey?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Here she goes again...
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
What'd you say to her?
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Who do?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
You ready for this?
More'n likely.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
How much we got left, honey?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
You're scarin' me, baby.
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
Oh God, Sailor.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Fan works.
You sick?
It's okay by me, peanut.
So where'd you say you was?
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
What could I be up to, Lula?
That was in Vietnam.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Damn!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I knew you'd want it again...
That's not why I called.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
What?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Whattya mean?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
So I hear.
She's a transvestite.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
How bad is it for you?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
No...
You driving this car?
I passed out.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
She told you about...
Vernon.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Sounds like a good one.
Really? That's remarkable.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
He didn't give his name.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
That's a big book you're writing.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Maybe she didn't come here.
I just wanted a little sip.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
That strikes me as odd.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
But where? I need the street.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
You heard? How?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Who's he barking at now?
I need a ride.
What's that?
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Excuse me?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
No, the dog.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
You want to keep him happy.
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Isn't it?
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
It's hard to describe.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
See anything interesting?
I think you do.
Yeah.
Fairy tales?
Woodsman?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
No.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Yeah, like the bird.
Banished... yeah.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Does he?
Your daddy will always love you.
You seem a little hostile today.
I don't understand.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
Will I ever be normal?
How do you define it?
How do they know?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
I don't know.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
Where are you?
What else?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Are you okay?
I'll buy a plant.
I get that impression.
Why do you want to know?
You're still here.
Do you?
Maybe later.
Did I say something wrong?
What did you do to them?
How young?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
You don't really --
I've changed.
I was always the one seduced.
Being here, with me.
I know.
I love my brothers.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Do what?
What's your fucking problem?
You okay?
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Okay so far.
Your rig?
I'm switching off now.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Son of a bitch!
Yuh?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
4800 feet.  It's official.
He can still make it.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
What is that one over there called?
At what?
Well, what?
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Oh, Sandro...
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Then I'll see you later.
Aren't you going to change?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
You say that just to flatter me.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
Looks like the weather is changing.
And what are we going to do now?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Where is she going?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
We have a radio like this, too.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
What boat?
Your mother?
Why have we stopped?
Because I'm getting fat.
Agnes...
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
That's not what he meant.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes, Mother.
I don't know.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
I love you.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
I've stopped menstruating
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
What things?
I don't know.
Agnes...
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Is that what she said?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
Yes?
Oh, yes.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
No I'm not.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
Why were you afraid?
Yes.
Who?
My bed.
Yes.
Yes.
Agnes, can you hear me?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
Stay away from me...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
She took the baby in her arms?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Look into the convent records.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Thanks. 
All I want is one more week.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I can get you new evidence next week.
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Marie's dead Mama.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
I can beat that.
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Obviously there was.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
And in your eyes?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
This was before her pregnancy?
She has it now.
Not simple, no.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
What?
All right, what do you need.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I don't think I care to know.
I knew that after the fact.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Even Christ would partake socially.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
She didn't want any help.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
They're yours.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Well --
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
I see you go to the night court.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Of course I can.
Ta.
That's not your Grandfather.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
What's up?
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Is it ... is it, really?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
The big hammer?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Books are good!
Me!
What are they saying?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
What's he on about?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Anything to spare?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
I hope he fell off.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
You needn't bother.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
We were going to do it.
I'm not, no.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
None for me, then?
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Look after him.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
I feel like shit...
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Locked.
Gravity?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
What's up?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Yes!
How long to fix?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
It's really on there tight.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
The flamethrower!
Can you get them back?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
What is it?
Yeah?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Martin?
Oh well... you know me.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
What film?
Take us up.
Food-storage room!
Which presumably means...
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
That'll blow the ship up.
Headache?  Dehydration?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
Listen to what?
What?
What?
What?  Where?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Okay.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Is this the suit?
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Okay, we're in business.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Think I spoke too soon...
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
How's it going?
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Phoebe?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
Eddie...
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
What a day - what a heavenly day...
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
What do you mean by that?
She was a liar, she was a liar!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
Then you've heard too.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
When? When are you going to do it?
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Bill...
I'll try.
And cut that out right now.
Knit me a muffler.
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
When I'm guest of honor?
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Why?
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
- and for you.
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
Well?
You don't like Eve, do you?
You all put together?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Miss Harrington...
What for?
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
I'm going to take you to Margo...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Congratulations, Eve.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Why not?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Why should he - and why should you?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
I just can't believe it.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Would you, really? How sweet-
How about calling it a night?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
You'd have been proud of her.
She was a revelation...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Let me lay a little theory on you--
You're not a kid anymore.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
I've got a lot of energy.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
Who were they?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
Go on.
--I saw him. He verifies.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
We can't talk inside either?
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Your name, please.
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Howard--
Haldeman.  Right?
Go on.
No, it was good.
Sure.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This.  Right now.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Charming.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You're missing the game for us?!
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
You're so big!
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Gotta go.
Like a bet?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Shame on you!
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
God dammit, Stifler!
Let me know.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I don't know.  How do you?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Contact, dude.
That junior chick?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Keep it down, dude.
<u>Yeah</u>!
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Our last game is this Saturday.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Salots! Shitfucker!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Hello?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Are you crazy!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Where?
What does it say?
Whoa...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Uncle Terrence.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Claude.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Shit. I feel sick.
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Did I tell you that?
You'll laugh.
Yes, your highness.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
What do we do now?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Singer!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
What do you mean, next?
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Stop it, Alvy!
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Hi. Hi, hi.
Me? Oh, downtown!
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Oh, right.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Your grammy!
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
No, I'm gonna quit!
Gimme a kiss.
Okay?
We can digest our-
M'hm.
M'hm.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Do I love you?
Yeah.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
What are you doing?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
You're so sure about it.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
It's his name.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
M'hm.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
What's- It's me, open up.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
God, it's so clean out here.
Christ!
Oh, good. Okay.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
God.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You look very pretty.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
I have a headache.
Tsch, a few.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Probably on their first date, right?
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Stop calling me Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
But she's colored.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
You think so? Do you really?
No, no, no, not at all.
Oh. What about?
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
Don't you miss it?
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Let's get the kids.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
Anymore.
You need to call your dad.
Monica.
Cal, my wife Judy.
There's a test, you know.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Not properly watered.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Otis!!!!
That is not true.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Don't push me away.
I don't want to go tonight.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Yes, she is.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Very well put.
What?
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I've never done this before.
I'm sorry.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I was impressed.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Are you lovesick?
You don't know she's a bitch.
How?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Shit!
No.  Not something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
That's not an answer, is it?
Thank you, Panes.
Yes.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Divinely?
Quiet -- sshhh!!
How should <u>I know</u>?
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Hlllllllp!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
So what makes you so special?
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Z!  Over here!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Affirmative.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
...I should?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
What do I do?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
I hope everything goes all right.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
How come?
This is a bad day for me.
Two o'clock.
No -- I don't want anything.
And where are you now?
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
A cemetery?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Why not?
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
You did?
Where?
Here.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You usually eat alone?
How's everything at the apartment?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Are you going to deny it?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Not that I have anything to hide.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
You threatening me?
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
She going to be all right, Doc?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Just as long as she's okay.
How do you spell her last name?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
That so.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me take that.
You know I liked it better long.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I want you back, Fran.
Important?
I wasn't trying.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
All set for what?
Baxter?
What are you talking about?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Where does she live?
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
You're out of your skull --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
That's good gin.
Yeah.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
We do.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Arch light.
Yes, sir --
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
How much is left?
They're not Cong.
I --
Signs?
Listen.
They nail him for it bad ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
But why ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
What's your name, sailor ?
You smell that.  You smell that?
Change.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Who knows.
Don't you agree?
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Do you?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
No water.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I think think a lie stinks.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
No -- no, Captain.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
What?
That's me.
What is this bridge?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Why did they attack us?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Well , who's in command here?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
34   CONTINUED:
215  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
You should know something.
Have you talked to Eric?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
What are you doing?
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
It's exactly what you meant.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
I'll tell you everything later.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You don't feel cold?
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Shut up!
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
Go easy.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Call me as soon as you're settled.
How long has he been having problems?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
What do you want, Melvin?
Were you asleep?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I've got to sketch you.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
What?
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Absolutely.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Oh, my gosh.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
That's very thoughtful.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
No shit.
Yeah.
Probably.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
You can't --
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
Oh, yeah.
You would be.
Why don't you tell me.
Hello, Robert.
You think this is a fucking joke?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
He wants to kill you?
And you want to use me to get him?
I don't need the money.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Why?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Why not?
No, they didn't.
Then you went freelance?
Why?
Because I want to know.
Are they usually like that?
They become complicated... messy.
I don't know.
What?
Really?
Sorry.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
We split the money?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Except --
What?
I don't believe that.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
What?
Thank you.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Were you attracted to me right away?
That doesn't sound normal.
Shit.
Electra --
Would you like a drink?
For what?
How much farther?
I think I've heard of you.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
You wish to close this account today?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
What are you having?
Cheers Katka!
Because it's in English?
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
So?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
No, for the Asylum.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We're going to need it all.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
What are you on about?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
That bad?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
What happened?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
And if you're wrong.
What about me?
What?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
No, by road?
That one?
There shooting at something.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
What?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Yeah, for sure.
They'll do it.
How?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
What would you like, beer?
No, just a coffee.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
You will wish you hadn't.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
No problem, is it at your place?
Just yesterday.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Why are there still such headlines?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
So, who is in the building?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
'Bout what?
It could help with a new car --
He wants to show now.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Thanks.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Late night.  You?
Were you with Jamie?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I told him to leave me alone.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
I'm thinking.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
Why?
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
You think so.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
You have to believe to have faith.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You're not in a very good mood.
Maybe you inspire me.
You don't know what you want --
We're doing something -- ?
Excuse me?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
Ergo?
That what you do?
How you doing?
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
How're you doing?
What's Landon Carter up to?
It was a play.
Dad --
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
No.
Materially or spiritually?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Yes.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
Where did you get -- ?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Oh yeah.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
It's polyester.
Hi, Marty.
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Huh?
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
What year?
Oh, right, right... 
Marty, that would alter history.
A mall?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
An atomic bomb.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What you been doing?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Tom...
Good luck to you.
Is that right?
What for?
Can I be honest?
Yeah, but I don't like it.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Is that all there is to it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Don't call me stupid.
Are you sure?
Why?
How you doing?
Think I got 'em?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Fine.
You didn't walk out here.
New Jersey?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
What?
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
You okay?
You're a welcome sight...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
Where're you goin'?
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
The girl I remind you of.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
A what?
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Pictures don't lie.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
How about you? Will you be alright?
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Before what?
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
Well I...
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
To do what?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And I could tell you some stories –
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Howdy, neighbor.
It's okay, it's okay.
...Your room does that too?
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Jesus... They can tell that...
It's okay... It's okay...
But Charlie – why me? Why –
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Congratulations.
Yes sir, they –
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
What –
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
How about the coke?
Yeah.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What do you want, Nick?
What did she tell me, Beth?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Are you arresting me?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
You like playing games, don't you?
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
You know all about me.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
You shouldn't play this game.
No?
I don't know.
Can I talk to you a minute?
No thanks.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Somebody has to die.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
What kind of talk?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
I don't think it's funny.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
I don't believe it.
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
You knew her, didn't you?
On what basis?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Hey – it's the big A.M..
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Let's get out of here.
Saddle River, New York!
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Piss painting?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
These are great.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
You gonna carry that around all night?
You do! You definitely do.
I thought you hated this place?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
You mean babies with you?
That is amazing. What year is it?
I'll take the whole tin.
That's great.
Wanna Mac?
You see? You have someone to live for.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
It's cold.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
What happened?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Working late?  I'm touched.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
That, sir, does not compute.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Please be looking for me.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
She knows who we are.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
No gun.  How disarming.
Where is my wife?
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Why, indeed?
How are you feeling, young man?
What?
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
What's wrong?
Now black rubber.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Mr...?
We'll talk some other -
La'chiem.
Rinka.
Just ones this beautiful.
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Excuse me.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Back off, man.
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Chase?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
What are you talking about?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
How'd you find this place?
I loathe bats.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
Is this what you wanted?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Keep her on the line!
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
I understand.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Yum, yum.
Peanuts?
Are they paying you for all this?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
David, I'm serious!
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
What happened?!!!
He's just parking the Governor's car.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Why thank you sir.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
And Boot-Head.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
...Two...
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Where are his pants?
She sure does.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
She's ready.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
Two hours.
What?
Handbook for the recently diseased.
What's she doing here?
Won't?  Or can't?
Oh, honey, we may need that.
That little girl saw us.
What about this Beetle guy?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
Nobody else can.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
God, you're anatomically correct!
W... What is it?
He's your cousin.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
You don't have a key?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Yes. I think so, too.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. I am.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
My name is Chance.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
How is Ben feeling?
No, thank you.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
I see.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I agree.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
A flower...
Hello, Ronald.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Does it have a television?
How long do we stay in here?
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
I live here.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Compensated...?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes. It has.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
... So what does all that add up to?
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
Take care of yourself, Ben.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
What?
Which one is Elijah again?
Is the trial date set?
We have to make it an early night.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
She's very beautiful.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back now.
Why?
What are you doing?
No they're not.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You were him last night, weren't you?
What's that?
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
Holy shit, yes!
Simulates?
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
Security.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Is that true?
Emily Dickinson.
Who told you?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Lotte, this is so good...
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fork ah did?
Think, Jew florist?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
No.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
I have to see you.
We have to meet.
Yeah, I saw them
How do we do that?
What's the play?
No.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Darling!
Yes. How did you know it was me?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
Stay in him forever?
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Sleepy suddenly.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
Baby, don't be like that.
Oh.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Back stiff?
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Aw, no, Ella.
Never found out.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
You shaved.
No, You looking good.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yeah?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Yeah.
What's this?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What's a pederast, Walter?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
No--
What have you.  We'll, uh--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Yes, heh--
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Yeah, but what about--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Well--yeah, I guess--
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Well...no, of course not--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Hey Walter--
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh?
Have it your way.  The point is--
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
Oh shit.  Walter.
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
"Our" car, Walter?
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
You know this!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
It's a heart attack.
Well can we--
What about that shit about Vietnam!
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Is this a--what day is this?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Well we--I don't--
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Who the hell is he?
Bullshit. Walter!
Whatta we do about the Mex?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
What do you want me to do?
I don't like it.
Where were you, Whistler?
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
From his father, of course.
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Whistler!
Stupidity.
I don't buy it.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
But, he could've --
What are you looking at?
Is he sick?
You care about him, don't you?
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
But you -- died --
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
How many of you are there?
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
How did you escape?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
--<u>myth</u>--
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You don't want it though.
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
--now c'mon!
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
I can't.
Whatever you want.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
That's what Josh and Mike said.
No fucking.
We should be so lucky.
Too busy eating us?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--who?
What?
Okay, but--
Spite.
Let's get inside.
--whatever you want, no problem--
Just hold on!
Oooh. Oooh.
Ah, Domini?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
For a blur?
Still working on it.
What?
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--the Sheriff's Office--
Where... where you going?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Well... what happened?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...What's going on with you two?
Thanks.
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...Anything else?
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
What do you think?
For the money.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Howdy stranger.
Where was I?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Frank. Come in.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Don?. Are you in with them?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you like my body?
Come on Dorothy.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Who, Dorothy?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Where are they?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Now, how are you going to do that?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
That sounds good.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You want to go talk to him?
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
You want to dance?
No.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Greetings, Mr. George.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
You happy, baby?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Tuna, this is crap.
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
No.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
I don't think so.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What's that?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
What type of planes do you have?
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
What?
You fucked me, Diego.
In how long?  A week?
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Freedom.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
Yeah, well...
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Not mad.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Jesus Christ.
Where are you going?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Are we gonna split up?
Dad.
Where are you going?
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
Yes, I do.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Stoned?
No shit, Kevin?
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Third group. What's your assignment?
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
To show them to the UN, right?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
How you doin' Mister D?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
Cause?
That's what my report will read.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What was the nature of the argument?
Can you?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I have.
She was here?
We were lovers.
I had bypass surgery.
She didn't.  She just left.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Did he make your life miserable?
What about Miss Lawson?
No.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Yes.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
-- And then?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Can we get out of here?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What's that for?
You don't need anybody.
You're a monster.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Yes.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
What time did you leave?
Did Marsh use it?
I nearly died when we split the bill.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
What's he saying now?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Well, I'd like to read them.
I never knew that.
They got heat in Michigan.
Heat is heat.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Roseman Bridge?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, really?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Oh, that's nice.
I doubt that.
He's very... clean.
We got engaged.
And did you?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
Smells like dirt.
Are you all right?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I would love to come for dinner.
Can I help?
Yes.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
What were you like when you were younger?
I can't do this, honey.
What?
You're somewhere else, where?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, what is this?
WHY?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
You feeling better Franny?
'Bout 4:30.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
What's her name?
Oh my God...!
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Died there?  How?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Just some flies.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
That's some terrible shit.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Where are we, baby?
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
It's alright, baby.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Shit, that was fast.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
I can't.  I can't.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
There's no time.
That doesn't make any sense.
It couldn't have been.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
You can't leave.
What?
Violet!
I saved you.
You betrayed me!
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
How many'd you do?
Why?
Are you okay, Violet?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Cease, can I ask you something?
I guessed you were straight black.
Are they really?
You're doing everything yourself?
I knew it.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
What's wrong?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What was it then?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
You think I'm lying?
Yeah.
Yes.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
That's his brother.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
There is no going back.
He'll have to run.
No.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Yes.
And what if I couldn't do that?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
That's all I get?
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
You have your passport?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Look, maybe I should just...
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?

You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Listen to what you want.
Okay, so you're a victim.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I should go.
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What is that?
You could do that?
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
He run away often?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You drink rum?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Her name is Jill.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Too late? That's for me to say.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
You got the wrong man.
You killed him?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
It could all be coincidental.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack?... Jack?
Bastard!!!
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You think these are tits don't you?
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Cut it out, Sam.
Let go! We've got to stop!
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
Your face ... are you hurt?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
What do you think? ... is it me?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Tuttle?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
What's the matter?
Sam Lowry.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
A woman eh? I see.
I'm sorry but ...
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
Are we?
Have you got one or haven't you?
What?
What is it?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Yes.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Five years.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
Frank.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Don't give me that look.
I'm sorry.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
The brakes are shot.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
What do you want to break?
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Keep it to yourself.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
It's not loaded.
Oh, God, no!
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
They booted me out of Washington.
He excels at gratitude.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
A half hour in the lobby.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
No.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
This isn't friendship.
I think you're the Devil.
Stop it.
Outside?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
We could...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
How do I get out of here?
Follow me.
Bad manners.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
That's okay.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
Nervous?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
It's not important.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What happened?
Hi.  It's me.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Why?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
You want to come?
Take it easy.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
A picnic?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I didn't finish talking to you!
See you later -
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
What's up, Walter?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
It was.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Maybe so...
Are you trying to be funny?
Nothing...nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
There's that weird dude again.
I didn't mean to.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
You didn't mean to what?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
How ya doin'?
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Huh?!!!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
T-tell him that?
What's wrong with you!?!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Yeah?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Come on, what was it?
You're even weaker than the others.
Will you guys shut up, please?
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Hey, Buffy...
Dress, huh?  What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
He did what he was supposed to.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Are you okay?
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Why don't we see a movie?
You look way pretty, Kim.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
In Virginia.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Why do you keep saying that?
Not a pressing issue.
Here?
They were vampires?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Fine.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
A what?
Vampires of the world, beware.
I can't work this.
All right.
Football is my life.
That's the plan.
Come one, that was so weird.
Nicole...
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Could be.
And Spring Fling.
I never thought of that.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Like you've got a grip.
Except for Prom.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
How was that?
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Death is like spring training?
That's my leg.
Yes I do...
We lost.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
That's great!
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
I got lured.
I'm Crash Davis.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Damn.
Crash...I want you.
He' s confused--
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I don't know if I'd go that far.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
He's a good student.
We gonna fuck or what?
What's that?
You a God damn witch?
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
What the hell's going on out there?
Well, I'd rather not say.
What are you talking about?
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
Was I at that dinner?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
...been right, but who knows?
No, you're not calm.
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
Mommy.
Okay, Sammy.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Ohh!
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Yeah?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
All right.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
She came to talk to me...
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Ginger called me.
And what'd she want?
How'd you know I was here?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Seven o'clock?
You go and put your things away.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Well, sir, I was just...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Uh-huh.
It's nice isn't it?
Hi. Nice to see you.
What do you need?
No.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
He wanted a watch, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Hi, Sam.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You fuckin' whore!
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Now you need approval from him to go home?
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
Well, I... I never tried.
What?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yeah, that works out.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Well, I've been busy. 
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Fucker!
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Come on. I'm sorry.
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
How are you?
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Sure.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Yeah.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Sure did.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yes, you are.
Is that what you want?
Nicky, please...
It's what you want?
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
I'm sorry.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Incredible.
Yeah.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Hey. This is Shelly.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Yeah.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Frankie!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Ch-Charlie M!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I'm positive.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
What's the matter...
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
She has a real spirit.
Winning.
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
You think so?...Selina?
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I'm a good mother!
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Hey, you're anti-male.
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Good morning.
Next time, call...
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
Then whose is it?
Lady, don't let him do it!
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You never miss a trick.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
I thought you said you could handle him.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
A woman?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
Don't say that.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
You can't give up.
Did you jiggle the phone?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Why can't it be her?
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
At least one.
L.A.P.D.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
You could've hit me.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
He wants 75 back.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
259-7881.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
I'm handling it.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Who are you working for?
They saw you kill the driver.
Pass.
Some loyalty.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
It's in the process.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Who were you talking to?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
There's no lady here.
Yeah?
It's him, isn't it?
See, they get the wrong idea.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Look, I'm sorry.
Fuck off, Dave.
Do you mean that?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
No.
Everybody wants something.
Give me that look again.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
What'll it be?
Someone out there.
Must be in love to manage that.
He was different.
Are you jealous of him?
Did he come here too?
He did sometimes.
You mean that?
Drink.
What is this?
Give it over, Dil --
Do you care, Jimmy?
Please, Jimmy.
Anything.
Don't call me that --
Why?
Come on...
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You killed my Jody
No.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Why?
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
I like you, Dil --
It's my name, Dil --
Tell me what she wore.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
See does he want some.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Perfect.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Yes?
Thanks.
Back in a minute, Jody
I'm sure.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Definitely unusual.
Aye, I do, Peter.
Right.
I seen your fucking face.
Thank you, handsome.
No fucking way.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
You make a nice couple.
Ever see hurling?
Never.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Yeah?
Why?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like the one about the frog?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Stop that talk now --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Oh, you should see your face.
What about it?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Of course there is!
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Agents.
Café.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Me? Why me?
Yes -- ?
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
What now?
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Scobie?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Cutting it out.
That sounds like their problem.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Or Tex?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Reggie -- open the door.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Well!
You mean, you're a thief?
I don't believe it.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
And if it is?
You sure nuthin's missin'?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
You loved him?
Leave?
Where did he keep his money?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
Did you?
Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.
No -- in my room.
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Oh. I guess.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Charles is.
Where did everything go?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
What?
What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
What is it about?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
What's the matter, chérie?
Yeah? What's that?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Good.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
A little.
You were eavesdropping.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No, you couldn't.
Why?
We just found another body.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
I won't.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Why?
Are you O.K.?
I did.
You know I want to go with you.
Lisa Sherman?
Wait.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Yeah.
You ok?
Did you want one?
You're so beautiful.
Hide your laptop here.
What?
Rod!
You're being unfair.
 Oh, shit.

Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
That's my business.
...Darlene pay you in cash?

He could've called first.
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
I need your truck.

All right.
I need your truck!
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.


Okay!  All right!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
That's right.  Now,  move!

Goddamn!
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on...
...ho!
No.  Shit.

Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.

...you're dealin' with!
...man!
You're--?  What?!
Come on!

See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...stole the truck.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
We got two paddles.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Put your hand in my pants.

Oh.
Okay. 

You got Elvis?!
Oh, shit.
 What's it say? 

We got-...
Hang on, hang on.
 Well.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
You, Arlo.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Yeah.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
What'd he say?
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I did what I could for you...
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
They were all wearing hardware.
And I changed the schedule.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Mm-hm.
"Went away."  I like that.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.

This is it.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
...-ty.
It's a hundred degrees...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
...time to time, yeah.
Hello.
I don't see my container.


...it.
Yeah?
Oh, no?
Ah.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
You got thirty minutes.
...now!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Is Elvis out?
...colonel?
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
My secret?
...without caution...
...-to a simple thing like...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
You find yourself wearing a...
...to talk, son.
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...tunnel now!
I'll lead 'em out.
Yeah, I'm sure.


Negative.  Negative.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
A ruler?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
My daughter.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Sure thing.
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
How do they do that?
Thanks, Lou.
I'd like to talk to him.
I want the rest of the pictures.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Matter of fact I do.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I'll stop by.
I have?
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
Did you have affairs?
Did he know?
For very long?
No, not for that one.
How did it happen?
What were you doing there?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
The Albacore Club.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Where can we go?
How do you know?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
I think I got something.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Ida Sessions.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
And Mulwray isn't?
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
When it comes.
No, really?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
He did or he didn't?
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
So he says you sent them?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
What's that, pal?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You don't say?
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
For what?
Who?
No...
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
I didn't see that.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
You don't really think so?
Go in and ask him to hurry.
I might make him nervous.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Wasted?
Charlie?!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
I know that, Emily -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Oh yes, there is.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
Toothache.
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Where's the towel?
A rooster?
How old did you say you were?
Half past eleven.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Raymond - 
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Why not?
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
What's wrong, Brad?
Why, Brad?
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
What about that apartment?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
You're shittin' me.
Excuse me, but...
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
Can I watch?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
You don't have anything to do with it.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Let me take you out tonight.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
What about Sing?
How'd you get here so fast?
Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
It wasn't me.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
With this guy locked in?
This is the last time I come to this place.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
That's easy to say from over here.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
That's what I said.
Why?
What do you two fight about?
Five years.
Eight and a half?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Return of the Jedi.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
There aren't.
The milkmaids.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
No, you're not.
Bible truth.
Oh, my god.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
What did she say?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Hey, what about Veronica?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You just fucked a total stranger?
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
How do you figure?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'll call you. Let you know.
Are you open?
Just the paper.
I'm her sister.
You know him?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Yeah, but...
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
I said go ahead.
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
It better be up to and including me.
Twelve.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Dante...
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I love you. Don't feel sick.
You had to tell him.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Thank you for the lasagne.
Randal...?
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I'm not sad.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
C-4?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
A monkey?
Glad you could drop in.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
I'm coming out!
What the hell are you doing here?!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
I'm going with you.
Enough.
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Hello, Gabriel.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I don't understand?
Did I miss something?
A flare up...
From one professional to another, of course.
Where?
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
Let's be creative.
I can't believe you just said that.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Of course I do.
It was great.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
We don't have time to argue about it!
I won't do it.  No way.
Have her come up.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Good evening.
Try the wine!
Thank you, sir.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Do you still feel suicidal?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
You've heard Beethoven before?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Indeed.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Yeah... Pete the English.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Go ahead, say it.
You like Bach?
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
You're kidding me.
Remember what you played?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd had to dig it.
Can't say that I do.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Twenty five?
So?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I was with Max when he got the call.
What's your name?
I brought you flowers.
I'm standing right here.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Yeah?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
You on some kind of work plan?
Why not?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
You always stutter?
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Who's that?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
I listen to classical.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
Would you have called her?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
No, not just that.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
That's what you said...
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Geronimo?
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Not for years.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
For what?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
You're certifiable.
You want something to drink?
Can you prove any of this?
Who?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
We're going to Queens?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Is that what they told you?
Back where?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Blue moon...
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
Liza Sutton is dead.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Excuse me?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Where'd you get it?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Working.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
What?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
I disagree.
Are you threatening me?
You...
Thank you?
And?
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Could we hear to the moon?
Could we hear God?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
No.  Please.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Hokkaido Island.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Peter Valerian.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
But the work --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
What day?
Champagne please.
Can you try?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
I don't think so.
I don't follow.
It's getting late...
The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I can't hear this now --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
But --
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah.
What are you doin' here?
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
What went wrong?
Lookit her bounce.
Go git it, Luke.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Hey, Tattoo!
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
What you mean, Luke?
But, Luke...
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Like I always do?
That fool. That damn fool.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
I hate this...
What did I do?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
When was that?
When he was seventeen.
Who are you?
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
You already made the delivery?
What Friday?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You know I can't do that.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
If he's not out, why are they here?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
That's no surprise.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
Don't hang up!
He was in my apartment!
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
It's none of my business anymore...
Answer it.
Classy madonna.
Absolutely.
Look at her legs.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
So what have we got?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
What the hell you need her for?
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
He's not treating her right...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Did you come?
That's going well, then.
It's about time.
It is?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
How?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
You did the right thing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm only looking out for you.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
What if it's got a pattern?
I wasn't hungry.
Really, this isn't funny.
No.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I do.
Well?
Tell me all.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Yeah?
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
I'm going to the store.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
No.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Here's the ring.
Oh.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
What are you doing?
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Hello?
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Someone else coming?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Tonight?
Get that, will you?
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
No.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal.
What?
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Everything.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
What about transportation?
They don't serve wine here.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
Going somewhere?
You guys used to work together?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Mr. Zammito?
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
And how do we do that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
You like shoes?
Something like that.
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She seems pleasant enough.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
I don't care about your sword.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
You're already a thief.
Shut up!
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're doing calligraphy?
Please.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I'll give them to you.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Don't send me back!
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Yes.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
No onions though, okay?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You don't say.
Fucking A, my friend.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
You're welcome.
Fun -- look at that guy...
You look like a rock star without a job.
Who?
What's going on...?
Another jolly nickname?
Does it hurt?
Yes.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Thank you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Excuse me?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
It's not really important.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Give it up.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm... I'm alright.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Where are you going?
How am I a hypocrite?
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
I love you.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Where did you say she's from?
I don't think that bothered him.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Those are my letters!
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
I... I don't think you want to know.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
What year are you in?
What are you doing?
I was just kidding.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
And then I can go home?
But -
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
What are the terms?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
You would not believe what--
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
What's your plan of attack?
Who are you calling?
Yippy.
Nothing.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
She shot you down.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
Why so nervous?
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Annette! Annette!
I'll do that.
Yes, you already did.
What do you mean?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
But where did you get it, Amy?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But wishes don't come true.
What do you want. Amy?
Can't you tell me later?
Daddy!
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But there's no one here, darling.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
I can not tell you.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
I can sea its breath in the cold.
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
But she's such a nice lady.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
But what happened to the little deer?
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
No, thank you.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Let the child stay.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
No.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
How have you been feeling?
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Hey, did you get contacts?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
And he was missing an arm.
DON'T call the police.
What the fuck are we going to do?
I think I just got my period.
Hello?
My apartment's just such a mess.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
So pee? Here?
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Where'd you get the bike?
So pay them back and apologize.
No.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
No, I got it. It's okay.
Is that how you feel?
Your breasts feel larger.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
She's just so... pathetic.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
It's for you. Frida.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
See he was cheating from the get go.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
They don't speak English...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
What is this place?
Iím sorry...
Don't know that either.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
Yes.
Known me for long?
What are you hiding?
How do you know I'm innocent?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
And we're going away for a holiday.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
... what?
Die, you pond scum!
Nightmare...
Like how?
Up and around?  Soon?
We think so.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
When does it break?
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Bob...
What I told him to?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
What happened?
Will he be alright?
In the car.
A teleprompter.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
What?
Yes, Mr. President?
And it's proving quite effective...
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
They re not my attack dogs.
How'd you get started?
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh... Yeah.
Anybody would have done it.
You1re leaving, too?
Are you hungry?
That's a secret.
You have a lot of secrets.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I never thought I'd...
It could be fun.
What about the intro?
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Then why did you come here?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
It's because of me.
No, sir.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Sounds boring to me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
It will?  How do you figure?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Yes... sir.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Sort of.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Are you going with Chet?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I didn't know you taught.
Don't stop!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
All right!  What'd she say?
Any group pictures in the annual?
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Look at this.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
So what do you think of my father?
I don't want to read.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Who?
And what? These things are octopusses?
Not an option.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I saved your life is what I did!
You don't have to be so touchy.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Quite a few.
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
You want ME to go up there?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Maybe plans changed...
What is it man?
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
Those are mine!
That's mustard!
I'll get the boots.
Yes, Albert?
We're all going.
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
They did not!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
I got delayed. I --
Fucking A.
You talk to him?
But you must come in.
No, I --
But I insist.
Thanks.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Vince. Hey, you guys --
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Not so good.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman!
Will you marry me?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
No. No, no.
You should have put that on last night.
I don't think about the shot that much.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Pow.
Huh?
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
You wanna bet?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
No.
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
No.
Cynthia! Sure.
That's who.
Never one.
Up a little there... What would you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to stop aging.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Sir, your transmission's fading.
Does it drive itself, too?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Wanna come?
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
...Have you been drinking?
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
Yes.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
But I like the new one better.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
You are afraid!
But what becomes of our souls?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Yes, why shouldn't it?
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
You know darn well it is.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
Not long -- now.
Coming along, Jabez?
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Oh, Jabez.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
But I'm glad to be home again --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mary --
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Hard luck -- like me.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
You'll be a father any minute now.
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Mary -- Jabez --
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Jabez ...
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
I want someone to talk to ...
I'm John McClane.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Powell?  What's going on?
How do you know?
This is --
Aw, hey...
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hello, Sonny.
Well.... huh ...
Yeah.  It was terrible.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah...
Well...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
I know I am.  I know!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He's makin' threats in there.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
How many you got in there?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
... armed robbery ...
What?
He wanted to kill me!
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
Don't fuck with me ...
What else?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Well, they go to guard school.
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Would I hire you?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
I'm glad it's okay.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
But I want to know what you think.
To show that we're negotiating.
Wyoming.
Yeah ...
Get over there!
What'd he say?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Fuck!  We did it!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?

He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
Talk to me.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Don't come back, either.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Squash it.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Good morning.
Is it a good morning?
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
What are you so worked up about?
Nice!
I'm getting paid...
...peanuts.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Hey!  What did I say?
Depends.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Whatdafuck do you want?
How much?  How much do I owe you?
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
Mookie?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
When?
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can't be staying long anyway.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
What?
Where are you going?
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
You deaf or what?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Whaddup.  Money?
I was going to buy a slice.
I know.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
In the new library there.
Excuse me?
I'm fine.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Sounds like a pirate.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Can he do that?
...cause you said...
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
If you have to ask, you don't know.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
That's gross.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
I thought I told you to get lost.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
What?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Can you believe it?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
What?
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Love it!
So, this is Leto the Just...
Yes, Sire.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
My Lord?
You know the ancient tongues?
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Don't touch my mother...
Always?
Always.
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
What's in the box?
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
What is it?
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I have no next picture.
But you're a big star!
I don't understand.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Eddie, you screwed up.
So why didn't you do it?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Why are you here??
Don't you have any savings?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
And who may you be?
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
But there's plenty of other parts.
Dolores, wait!
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Yeah...?
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Yes?
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
I like.  When do movie shoot?
What is happening?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Is there a script?
Are you a fruit?
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
Lugosi?
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
I got married last night.
Oh, it's you again.
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
What was that?
Uh, atomic energy?
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
I'm moving out.
How you doing, Ed?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Leave her be.
Where are you going?
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
You said that.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah?
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No. It's a mess.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Could've been a nurse?
And what did he come back now for?
St. Joseph's.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Ma...
What's going on over there?
Hi. Is Shari here?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
So?
Right.
Well, when you put it that way.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
Okay.
It's not their fault.
No... Could you?
Everybody's someone.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
I'm doing all right.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
All right.
Ray --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Who is it?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Please!
Yeah.
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
That's the point -- this could change things.
How?
Yo --
Tu
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Yeah, just --
Having a problem with your eye there?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Why are you doing this?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Which door?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Still clear?
Yeah.  I'm here.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Okay, let's say
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
I'm not like you.
What...?
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, get out!
How's the left these days?
What's it to you?
That obvious, huh?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
I don't know.
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
Will you work for me?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
What?
You expecting problems?
Ellis Loew.
You wanted to meet here?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I don't know him.  Mr...
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Anything?
Nothing.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Say what?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
I need to speak to you.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I'll take your word for it.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
On what evidence?
None.  Call it a hunch.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Under the house.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Around.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Brill?
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Listen--
Clear as day.
Told by whom?
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
And you won't. Now move--
I called my wife!
How'd you get around the tap orders?
How'd you have the manpower to--
The NSA killed him.
Who?
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Goddammit--
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Reynolds.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
What are you dialing?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Neil, thank you for your help.
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Very good.
That's my point.
Yes?
About what?
Somebody took my blender.
Anything at all?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Something bad happened tonight.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I was missing you.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
Do you like fish?
When do I get to meet him?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
It's how he works.
You're not.
I've never met him?
Yeah?
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Who won the fight?
How long can you stay?
It's okay to use the phone.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Can I talk to you a second?
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
They're framing me.
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Yeah.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
He had help.
I just meant--
We believe?
Yes?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
As the wife of one of our party.
What am I looking at?
Will you not come in?
Will you please come in?
I'm impressed you can sew.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
It's so cold.
Don't leave me!
Appropriate?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
I told you so.
Okay.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Are you Hana?
Where've you been?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
What?  How could he have?  When?
And you've forgotten yours.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
The rest meant nothing to me.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Are you asleep?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Excuse me -
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Really?  That's sudden.
You get Hardy.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Will you come with me?
Kip… I -
He can't even move.
No.  He's - no.
Hello miss.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
I'll come with you.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
Kip?
What are you talking about?
Through a window.
We've got to catch him in the act.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Don't overestimate yourself.
Where are you at least?
He's on to something bigger.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
And I thought we were getting on so well.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
I know.
Possibly.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
It's one way.
That's entrapment.
What's my problem? You want a list?
Lose something?
I know it well.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Someone was expecting that.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Did I hear a car?
Got it.
Charged?
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
Camera in the--
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
We're living history here.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Peoples China Bank.
A parting gift from the Empire.
You can't be serious.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
No way to take another day or two?
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
The door's the only way out!
What's wrong.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
Because I never assume anything.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
It's too soon.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
You're giving them to me?
Thought you had to use some of these.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
Yes it does.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
So you say.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
They did?
The judge came up with a number.
Oh, my God.
And get someone to help around the house.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
This is the only thing you found?
I don't get why they'd do that.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Then I don't get anything either.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
What kind of things come up?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Not in my world.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
How do you know that?
You see your office?
Right.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Nope.  Maiden.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
I don't know.
She's one of the sick people?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
You got more than one?
You got a little girl?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
What're you doing?
What?  But you been working so hard --
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Lock the door.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
There's something else, too.
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
He will learn patience.
Will he finish what he begins?
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
And what are they, pray tell?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
What was it?
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Now you're making sense.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
You look silly.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
No thanks.
No hard feelings?
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Not really.
Thanks.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Closer?!
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
I don't believe it.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
What's in there?
Free your mind and return he will.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
They're my friends.
May I say something personal?
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Ooww!
Give it.
It's so good to see you again.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Get this crap out of me.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Does he know how to activate it?
No way.
How do you know all this?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
Who is, then?
Ye...
Why?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
To me? But why?
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What's Burke got to do with it?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Chris MacNeil?
Please go away.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Where?
But how?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Like what?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
What's the difference?
What kind of stuff?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Captain Howdy.
He's nice.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Regan, why are you reading that?
Mr. Dennings?
But you like him.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodnight Dims.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
Intensely.
Did you do that?
In time.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No momma.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Sick priest, is that it?
Come on!
Who?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
I don't know.
What about tomorrow?
Swimming trunks.
What's wrong with them?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Oh.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Out.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Seeing anyone in particular?
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Frank?
We don't get a gig.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No.
What was it like?
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
That's what we agreed.
I'm not unhappy.
Come on, stand still.
You hit me.
So what do you think?
I thought we all had separate rooms.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What?
What's the matter with you?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
The Royal.
April.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
I don't know. Some disease.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
So what'd you think?
No, no.  You boys are tired.
You sure?
Just call me a cab.
Actually, that's my stage name.
Right.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Don't take it personally.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
When?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What I mean is --
What's he talking about?
That!  You can't wear that!
Oh, thanks.
You play all these places?
Smells like fish.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Huh?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Is that important?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Black.  Labrador.
Frank works hard.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
I can keep the beat.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
The both of them?  In there?
Long story.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
So ... ?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
So. How are you?
Fine.  You?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Drive.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
So you had a nightmare.
One last time.  It's important ...
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Go on.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Castor's escaped!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...
Rise...and...shine...!
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
Where do I go now?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
She is relentless.
So could you write down her exact address?
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
How'd you know my name was Jack?
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Me?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Look, I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
That’s it?  That’s all I get?!  A glare?!
Evelyn, right?
Need a nurse?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
For us, Kate.
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
Jack...don’t even start...
What are you doing?
She’s your dog, Jack.
Hey!  I was watching that!
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Say it, Jack...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I could stay here forever...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You’re moving...
You can’t go!
Mrs. Peterson.
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
No...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Of course I did.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I mean...
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
How long was I out?
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
What the --!
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Where...where am I?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
And they're changing into...
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Back it down, Johnny!
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
What are you doing?
You <u>were</u>?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
The less time, the better.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Doctor...
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Then how come it worked loose?
No need to get up --
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
We can't take a second more.
I've done all I could with the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
If there's any chance --
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sort of.
Come on -- it's no use!
Was there any damage?
What do you mean?
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Or your fucking wife, you know.
What?
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Huh?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Okay.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
My wife! What the - how's -
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Mm.
Uh-huh.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
It's okay, Scotty.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
How ya doin', Wade?
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Yah, that's a good one.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
So?
Yah, is this Marge?
Linda.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
It's terrific!
And his wife?
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
You are?!
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
This is... really a shock...
You need to lighten up.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
That's the idea -- we split them.
So you're staying in tonight?
What are you talking about?
Here.
Whatever.
When?
I don't know.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
Marla...
I'm sorry, but I...
Who did this to you?
Oh, yeah.
... You know me?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
I mean -- for a living.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
I guess so.
Insurance'll cover it.
I don't... think so.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Strange.
I know that.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Good answer.
You're okay with this?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
Homework assignment.
What the hell ... ?!
What... ?
What... what are you saying?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
Yes...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
I think this is about where we came in.
Not exactly according to plan.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Do something for me.
Who is this?
Very good, Sir.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Yes, it is.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Stop the car!
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Ninety.
What's this?
That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Alright.  Home run.
Yes.
You're gonna love it.
Intelligence work.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Invulnerable.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Why me?
Christ almighty.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
I know.
What's your name?
There were treating me like a headcase.
Let's do it.
Will it hurt?
Well, there's nobody special!
What?
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
<u>What</u>!
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
And who's Lydia?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
... What?... You don't want to commute?
What?
But..How could that happen?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
.....Me neither.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
A list.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
How much?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
A quest?
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Do you follow her every day?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Who are you talking to Jack?
What?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
How do you know him?
Don't say that.
You're married.
Divorced.
I leave it to you.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Yes.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
You like it?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Who?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Wasn't it, ladies?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Sorry.
Who's Van Oost?
Yeah, me, too...
It's not that bad.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
I think he's got a terrific personality.
It's none of your business!
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
I don't find your language that charming.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
What?
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
There's some good things on it, though.
Miss Dupea.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Fine.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Do you have a name?
So watcha doin'?
Whadja wanna see me about?
I did.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
They are?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
Which one?
She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
Yo, that's my girl.
Positive.
Where you know Amanda from?
Would you like me to change anything?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
What? What are you talking about?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
You can't keep me here.
Greetings, everyone.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
No children?
Well, which one?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I'm serious, Sam.
The two surfer boys?
What?
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Nothing. They're still there.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
You may be right.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Read this, please.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Right.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Why don't you try suicide?
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I'm still here.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
They serve dinner on the flight?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
'Magic' today, huh?
My hero.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
John Ultrarelamensky.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Why do you keep doing this?
I have this effect on lots of women.
Alan's in Utah.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
But I've seen the deed.
What is this....
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm terrified.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
You broke it? You know the source?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Who?
I'd say charcoal.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I want something I can print!
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
I was upset.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Now that we've broken the ice...
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Yeah, let's bury her.
You okay?
I came to warn you...
Aha, just what I suspected!
What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Pretty smooth, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Are you okay?
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
You need it.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Who's my real father, man?
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You'd said something about proof...
You're that guy, the private eye.
Only on a first name basis.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Doyle.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Well try, okay?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
You want some eggs.
Where the hell is it?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Hey, Bo.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
What I know is what I told you.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
It looks open on the other side.
I love you, Bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Queens, New York.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Hello?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
29 years...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Whatta we do now?
Got it.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
It's not your fault, Dad.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
In my pocket.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
How you feeling?
Longbranch...?
Huh?
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
A hot shot, huh?
I hear that.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Where are you going?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
I don't know...
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Come on down!
Derek... stop.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
You know him?
Hi.
What d'ya got in there?
Is... is everything all right?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Darren, we better turn around.
Whaddya mean?
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Ahh, nothing.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
But, Dad, we...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Why?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Boy scouting.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
So let's talk.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
For a good reason.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I know what it sounds like.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
But she might be in trouble...
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
A major prick.
I guess not.
Time to check out the waiters.
Did you hear that?
And you'll never do it again.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
I...I can't...
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I used to drive a taxi.
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Don't talk like that.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
You say we go?
Where are you going?
Shoot him.
This could be it.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
How prominent?
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
People are dependable.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
It's a complicated subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
I don't know.
Because life is good.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
I hate the Mets.
Yes.
Oh. You know him.
Engaging.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
You will respect the law.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
A great deal.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
I would rather march.
Do you find me stubborn?
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
We need your help!
Perhaps some tea?
All right. Fine.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
How much extra?
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Surely you know what you have.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with it?
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.
We can't stay here.
In a corridor.
How was your evening?
Where are we going?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
How do I square the accident?
You worried about the cost?
No bother.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
I envy you, Jerome.
Who are they?
What happened?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
Hi.
What's Beynon got set up?
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Fatter... some things never change.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Yeah... I know.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
I mean it.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
She's on TV.
I'll bet you can.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
How much?
What is it?
Come on, come on.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
All right. Shells?
Okay. How many bank exits?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
He took the day off.
Drive.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
Two years.
What's the damage?
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I've got to stop.
What did you do?  Albert?
This is my brother's car.
She's nothing to do with me.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes.
You know Sid Fletcher?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
It just would. He was always the same.
Nowt.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
And what you going to do?
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
They came back?
That little shit!
Do you want breakfast?
Do us a favour?
You coming back?
What you doing around here then?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Yeah.
We've got to take you back to London.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Polacks and deadbeats.
To get on the...
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
...this shit...
I, I...I...
Eh...?
...that's right...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Nurses.
With River Oaks?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
That's what I...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Somebody...
Yes.
How many leads have we got?
No.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
Yes.
What?
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
They're going to come to everyone.
Are you sure?
Yes.  I'm sure.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
It's a waste of time.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
They aren't?
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
I don't know, George, why?
That they're going to be upset.
Excuse me, sir...
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
...you didn't close...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
You know what those leads cost?
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
...they kicked out.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I will close.
Alright.
Now?  Now?
Can't do it.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
What does that fucking mean?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Why?
You did that?
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
They took the phones...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
The monthly interview...?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Twelve-fifteen.
Rick...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
You don't count Saturday.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
What was yesterday?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I'm...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You going to turn State's?
You hear what I said?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
...you want to go out today...?
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
...I wouldn't worry about it.
No, where is it?
Will you take me?
I can help you.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
We have no money for a rug.
What if we don't pay?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Goddamn bitch.
I understand...
We were all upset about that.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
No.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
...Who?
But, you told me yourself...
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
And you believed that story.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Hello?
Yes.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
That plane goes to Miami...
They are everywhere!
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The room has a bug in it.
You're right.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Michael.
Where can we talk?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
How is his health?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
I deny his every charge.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Turnbull is a good man.
We'll try.
Are we going to eat or what?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
The same assurance we got from you.
We got no choice.
I'm talking about Italians!
What's this?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
It still hurt.  A lot.
You liked it too.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
You will not hurt him?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
It's not what you think.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
What did she mean by going flooey?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Broke is more like it.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
Do you mind?
Did anyone laugh?
I don't like to talk about that.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
I'm not, you know.
I never thought you were.
So we understand each other?
Very well put.
What happened?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
You're the one who started it.
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
I don't hear anything.
Who's that?
That only leaves the rest.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Do I have any other choice?
The Great War?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
What won't do?
Why?
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
What was that?
You okay?
Did I hurt you?
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
Where's Betty?
You didn't, Jimmy.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
More your line.
No.  I expect you can't.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
My monsters?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
How's the leg?
Six years ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
You got no choice. It's over.
How is he?
You know my back -
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
You'll leave -- ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Got it ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Donny --
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What color?
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
There's no one left ...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
Any more, O -- ?
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Hey, Kip ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Hey, you want something to eat ?
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
Shadow games ...
Price of doing business...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Shit ...
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
And here I am...
Six or seven...
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Hey.
She's trouble --
You mentioned that in your letters
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
Unlock your button ...
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Wrong preposition...
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Is he still working here ?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
Wha?  Me?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods again.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Stop! Stop!
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
There are cops all over the place.
You want the melon?
How?
Yeah.
Done.
Yeah.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
I don't want them left back.
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
Thanks, Chuck.
How's the woman?
Gone.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
I guess so.
Yah, all right...
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
I think so.
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
I don't know what it's called.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Yes.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Not at all.
I live right around the corner.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Why there?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
About thirty million to one.
Who is he?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
You think so?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Tell me what you really think.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Yeah.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
You're kiddin' me.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Not to me, they're not.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
Yeah, I think so.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Like me?
Yeah, but how do you know?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Is that what you think--
I'm not honest?
What about your twelve brothers?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
How 'bout you?
She's hotter'n a heifer.
I guess that's what he looked like.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Been out travelin' around?
No, I never. What?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
What you figger to do?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Sure do.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Yeah.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
But will it--hurt the baby?
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Got any more, Ma?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
What do you do?
You do not.
What?
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
It's me. Martin Blank.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Where have I been?
Which would you rather...?
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
You never could have kept this from me.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Hard to get good help these days.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
It was the PLO.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
All of it?
They blame you for the compromise.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
What's a revival tent?
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
So what happened to you?
No. You drove us here.
He gave me a great deal.
What the hell happened to you?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
How's that?
You okay?
So how was your first and last day of branding?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Fine!
What about him?
I don't care.
Don't they believe in signs here?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Who is it?
Let's bring your bags inside.
David?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
I miss you, Annie.
About what?
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Take your time.
Oh, I don't know...
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Mixed salad.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Mmm. An editor.
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
Long enough.
What do you mean?
Now that's cool.
You think it's cool?
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Yeah?
Dead?
Revenge.
No. No one special.
Shit! Come on!
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Yes!
Think you can do better?
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Yeah.
Are you challenging me?
I'm sorry, I can't.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
You what?
Why did he come to you?
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Dade.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Homicidal?
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
So?
So?
Not without Jamie.
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Mom, please
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Its too late.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
You guys always look great.
Four plus Myers.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Jamie, wait for me.
Where are you going?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
When he makes that call.
Something?
He's been here.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
How's it powered?
Car trouble?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
What happened?
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yeah.
What do we do?
Jesus!
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
I don't like that story.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
I killed him...
Laurie, you come with us...
Let's make more popcorn.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
It depends on what way you want to go.
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Yes.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
And it's just in one ear?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yes.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
But not over me?
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
They're fantastic.
She has all the cooking talent.
Are you?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Absolutely.
Hmm?
What's the problem?
Because I have to!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
It was on your shirt!
Yeah.  What?
Hi.  Where's Holly?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Yeah?
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
...you know?  I, uh...
Thanks, thanks.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
What?  You're kidding!
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I know, no--  I know.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Oh, so loosely.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Oh, no.
Yeah?
...in a really horrible way.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
No, I haven't.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Oh.  Oh.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh!
Oh, God!
Oh, who cares?
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Just a few minutes ago.
Mickey?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
A reward for what?
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...I was <u>working</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Then I'm doing fine.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Yeah, so where is he?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Hold up a minute...
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
I like Popcorn...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
No, no, of course not.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
I can make you rich.
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Shut up, Starling...
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
Of course, Commendatore...
My scar is a war-wound.
You know America?
Is it necessary to know?
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
No, I don't get you...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I came to pay my...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
The girl could use some help.
...which of us is free...?
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Why?
I am on the track of...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Because...?
"Because we don't have any money."
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
What shape is the scar?
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
What're they on about?
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
What is your point?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
Howdy Pouty.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Mine!
No, they're not from Wendy.
Your Secret admirer?
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
Yeah. And?

Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...

Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Oh, I have to hear this.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I'll think about it.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
Where did you get these?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
I said I was sorry.
Veronica, you look like hell.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Killing her won't solve anything.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Let's kick his ass.
Is it sleeping, dude?
I think so, man.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
You two....
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
That's three things.
What's that?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Look who I've found!
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I shall call him Diello.
You're such an incredible woman.
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Are you a dream too?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
I'm stumped.
It's inside a moving car.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Must be nice.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
What?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
What do you want?!
Do you know where you are?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Dreams?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You okay?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Often, uh.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Mister LaPlante...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
I didn't even know you had a kid.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
I snuck in.
Yes.
You were... very... inspiring.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Helluva story!
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
That would be stupid.
Sure.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Baby, what is it?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
Stop knowing me so well.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
How long does it have to be a new house?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
What -- what are you doing?
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Who was that?
I'm having the floor fixed,
Just reduced.
It's fun.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
I have a cold.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
You?
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
It will be a good harvest this year.
Agreed.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
If it's good advice.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
I don't have any answers for you.
Who was that man last night?
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
How can that be?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Fine.
What will you do?
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
You get anything on Smith?
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You won't die if you let me help.
Bullshit!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
I have to tell you something --
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
I'll give you these people.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Okey-doke.
Donuts here any good?
What do you mean?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
All right.  Now the second one.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's not enough.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
He says that his father's hurt.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
Not until the man calls.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Where are you right now?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Okay.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Did you find the disks?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
We, who is we?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Please, I don't use guns.
You want to pay me?
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Give me it.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
What is it?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations are still here.
Satellites.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
You are a marked man.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Satellite feed.
Let’s go, Jock.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
Move? Where to?
Thomas wants advice?
He wants your wisdom.
No.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
What about us?
But who is left?
What sort of car?
I have to stay.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
What are you doing?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Where?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Not yet.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- bullshit --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Oh, for chrissake --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
-- I did: down here.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
If you know where it is, get there!
I'll meet you down there.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
What? Deep down inside?
Why not?
You hear somebody?
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
You okay?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Really? Well, let it rip.
Question answered.
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
No, no, it's just --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
What're you talking about?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
-- confirming everything we already know --
Oh, no.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Pritchett: what is going on?
For the love of God....please...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
What will they tell you?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Did you find her?!
I don't understand.
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Where is she now?
I want this one, daddy.
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What?
It just disappeared.  Literally.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
You don't think I know?
We don't know.
I think we should do it.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
You must be the new tenants.
What...amulet?
What are you getting at!
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
What do you mean?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
So where is it?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
I'll boil some water.
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Terri?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Joey?
That was beautiful.
The security's actually not that severe.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
You got about five minutes and change.
Did I miss anything?
My life is not some deal.  I...
How.
What the hell....
Anna, what are you trying to say...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
And I'll bring my entourage...
I was the Warden?
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Oh Hudson...
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
Bunny, not you too?
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well, maybe I --
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I'm happy enough.
Ol' satchel-butt...
-- and she's dynamite!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Well, I --
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
...What happened?
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
...You do?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
...You son of a --
I filed it yesterday.
I can't print this!
Ya know, entry level!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
This I know, Benny.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
Yeah, but, buddy --
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Well, frankly, I...
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Not even behind your back?
Not that way! Through the door!
Damnit, where's my car!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya don't say.
...adenoids.
Good morning, miss.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
You don't believe in it?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
But it's so far away...
Mr. Holland?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
But she's not dead, Wes.
And charming?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
I don't know -- I don't know--
Why?
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
You're not going to --
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
Anyone special? You know...
What are you talking about?
Talking to me, dad?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I don't like coffee.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Am I right or am I right?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
I do.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
You have to follow me?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Yeah. Yours?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
And?
Right.
Hey Wendy.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Are you his girlfriend?
So far.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
I could say the same thing about you.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
You know I remember that.
No way.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
What if someone finds out?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
What the hell do you know?
Wild card.
Monstrous.
Who made us what we are?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Are these not the answers you came for?
What night? What do you mean?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Louis, look at me.
And you never cried -
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
What do you want from me?
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Let's call that a start.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
What have I done?
I know. It gets cold so fast.
Fascination...
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
We belong in hell.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
What are you saying?
Lestat!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
How did you do that?
You're not lying to me, are you?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes.
You promise to care for her then?
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
No.
Hello? Hello?
Karla! You promised.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
I'm holding your hand!
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Checking the locks again?
You sure?
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Why are you doing this to me?
...Why?
How much?
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
How's the water?
Goodbye.
) You feel the symptoms?
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
I felt he did not like me.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
How do you know what my father thought - -
Woman, what are you doing here?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
You are my friend.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
What?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
I know. I know.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hey, Ernie!
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
What's that?
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Yes, sir.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Hello, Violet.
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Holy mackerel!
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Me?
If I told you it might not come true.
Didn't you tell her?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Don't you like her?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Where's your coat and hat?
Oh, George, George!
How about that one there?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
I can't wait to get there.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Shut up.
We better go back in.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
The lighthouse?
Throw it.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
You coming up on him?
What is it?  What's there?
Good morning!
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
In here.
I know just where to go.
How long ago?
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
I kind of had plans....
You said something about a camera.
What else you got?
It came up during the meeting.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can't you tell?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Where the hell were you?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What is it?  What's the matter?
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
We have to do something.
Bullshit.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
They made me go with them.
How old is your cousin?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Ready?
Get a dance yet?
Tina Wilcox.
Shut up.
About damn time.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I don't care.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Heading back?
He's got to help or it won't work.
Who wouldn't.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Well, not much longer to go.
That macho pompous English --
It's his work.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Up.
And leave me down here???
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
How the hell did it get in here?
After what happened to us?
Here.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
Sounds wonderful.
Yes.  It's faster.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
So?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
But you --
Nobody told me.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Afraid I can't do that.
Thanks for helping.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
'Course they're also so rich.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Come on, it's fun!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Told you you'd like it.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Make sure you put this back.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
That's impossible.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
I want to see Kathryn.
Come on, let's go.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Turn it off....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Where's my mother?
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
The fish.  Check it....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
No....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
How do you like flying?
I'm fine.
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
They had them on the big one....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You the architect?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Still chasing fish?
How many...?
I made them, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I invited you...
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
How long has he been here...?
Half don't...Bring her about....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
I'll do it, Jake.
I told you....
What?
What about that kid, Ross?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Yeah, he can go ...
Not for me ..
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
Did he shut you down?
Why's she blind, Bro?
You don't really believe this?
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
And did they?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I know what a "witness" is.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
What color was it?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
When did John divorce?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
No one has ever dumped me.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Oh come on --
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
... light.
It's all going to work.
Too bad.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Well.
What?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
It's my fault.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Forgot your keys --
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
No.
I understand your anxiety.
--  the kwan.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
How do I know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
I think so.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
You okay?
I'm fine.  What's up?
You'll lose.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Shut up!!!
...once-in-a-lifetime.
How much weight have you lost?
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Oh, don't worry about that.
Young adult.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
What?...WHAT!?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
We should try fishing again.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
How was your trip? Profitable?
You rented an automated litter box.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Baryonyx?
You think they could talk to each other?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
In Costa Rica?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
What did you think?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
How much of this island have you explored?
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
I don't believe you.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Well, is he?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
It's... behind... us.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
We can't stay in here!
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian.  It's guano.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
WHAT ARE YOU-
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
What?  No menthol?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The what?
Why would they care what we think?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
Constantly sick.
Not just every six weeks.
- - barfs them up - -
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
The fences are electrified, right?
Alan?!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
I can't see.
In a box under my seat.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I threw up.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
You got me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Ah - - they're here.
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
All night?
Watch how it eats!
Please!
Sustain winds 45 knots.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Two.
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
You think that's going to work?
Oh?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Yeah, what is it?
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
What is it really?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
An empty tomb?
Did you see him?
You're detestable.
I know.
What?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- Listen to me --
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
What did she say?
What's the matter with you?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Father!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
There's a light up ahead.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Give it back!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Man Eater!!!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
It must have been terrifying?
Why?
What's that?
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
She was with you after she left Frank.
Don't belong?
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
So do I.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Oh no, I don't think --
Who?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
What're you gonna do next?
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
I don't get you.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
What?
You and I -- a relationship.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Well --
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
I wanted to give it to you first.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
She told me.
Has she talked with you since prison?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
No.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Yes sir, we know he --
What does?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
What do you like best about her?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
What about my orange juice?
Will she pick me up after school?
C'mon, there's not much difference--
You get a new fence.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I want a pizza.
Then eat around it.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
I'm sorry...
I don't think so.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Like a principal?
What don't you understand, pal?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Yes, your honor.
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection.
Eight, almost nine years.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
I don't recall.
I don't recall.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
What about Billy?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Only can I still see him?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Wow!
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Yes, what?
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
What?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
I'll take my chances.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Ted?  Are you there?
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Huh.. .Hello?
We must go, Holiness.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Are you, General?
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
I have.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Your father had been very sick.
How many?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
Roughly five thousand men.
In the Pacific Ocean.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
Completely.
Too young?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
You're a beautiful woman.
It happens when I land.
Mr. Cyr!
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Was he a good man?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
Thank you, Jack.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
Such the flirt.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Okay.  We're up at six.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
You're mushing it a little around the--
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
It can't work.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
If I'm ever in New York...
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
He's done.  He's dying.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Well.  At wakes.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Not yet.
Hey!!
You threw it at me!!
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Are you okay?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Did you get him?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
A tooth?
Are you on drugs?
I'm not even a field person.
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Backstabber?
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Where?
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Who's the subject?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
What would it take?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Sometimes you do.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
All flayed...?
I didn't.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Much further?
No. I will find you.
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
Will you go back to England?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
And if we're unlucky?
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Will you men help us stop the French?
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Got a reason to stay.
What a place for them...
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
No!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
What?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Shit!  He sent them all.
They know, don't they?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Where's Doc?!
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Not yet.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Itches like hell.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
No fuckin' lie...
Who were you talking to?
What's wrong?
It needs blood?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
The shack...
Probably no longer than four weeks.
How much did you part with?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
You all right back there, mate?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
How long has he been in there, son?
About twenty minutes.
What can I do for you?
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Right, his leg's going now.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Well, what's going on?
There's nothing in it!
What do you mean?
Why, what's up?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Right as rain.
You and me, Tom.
That's if I want to see you.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Hello, can I help you?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
My van is half full.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Six.
How many wings have they got between them?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
What do you mean?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
And what did she do?
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Please.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
No, sir. Not at all.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You're dismissed.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
That the word on our boy?
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
That badge--
Everybody on the border knows that story.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Whole different story; isn't it?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
If it's too late--
Where'd he get all this?
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
They fought against the Indians?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
How's your room shaping up?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
So where does that put us?
We been through this before--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
That's right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Tell that one, Hollis--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
We don't need a new jail.
That so?
No.
Hey, Sam.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals--
A little older than Paloma is now.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
You had to deal with him in running the club.
And my father?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
It's Saturday.
How much you got left?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
They've got my Amado.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
No--
Couple months before I was born--
Yeah--
You're out early.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
You know who it was?
Otis what?
How come you don't took familiar?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
How much?
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
How'd you spell that again?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
If you've lied to me to me --
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
You don't?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Harry.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
I told you --
I was so afraid.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Oh God!
No!  No!  No!
Don't look.
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Bad show last night?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
He got up and walked.
And this Butterfield guy--
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Are you sure?
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
A Mister Quaid?
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
My God.
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
The Puritan?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Oh yeah?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
No.
Nobody's better off this wav!
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Can you do it?
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Maybe... I... don't...
What is?
Yes.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
You'll do it?
Oh, what do you do with that?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Of course.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't remember.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
No one ever tells you that...
You made it.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Hello, darling.
It's Lydia, your wife.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
That's ok.
Great.
Hospital?
Why do you have to defend her?
You wanna come?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
John! What are you doing here?
You never said anything to me...
Hmmm.
Peter, where are you?
I'm still shaking.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
What time did you make it for?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You raised me, like a son.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
What's that got to do with you?
So what'd I miss?
And the point is?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
What about after?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
He was trying to tell me something.
It's useless...look at him.
You know what?  You can go.
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Monica, what did you do?
I can't eat before a game.
Dad around?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
So what do I do?
She's alright.
Which one for tomorrow?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Coach...
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
That was nice.
Wait...
A horse?
That too tight?
I know...
I told him you looked like me.
Yeah, right.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
Thanks.
I know.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So...does it hurt?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
That's it, give it your best shot.
Hey.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Yeah.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Yo, where's the "D"?
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
You forgot to be there.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
When did you decide all this?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
A rest?
So...how's the knee?
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
So why'd you give up ball?
I'll play you.
One game.  One-on-one.
So you're gonna bitch up?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
What's that, not great?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
What surery?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
Well can you connect me to someone else?
I'm here, I'm listening.
Brain and Lung.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
OPEN THE DOOR.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Who was it?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's not -- what's a 422?
Just Jim.
Please, yes.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Let's make a deal.
Well.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
I'm sorry --
-- can I get you?
-- what kind?
Where's Richard and Julia?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Can you hold it?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
How much you pay me for my help?
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
Did you listen to me?
What's up?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
"The" cause of dullness in others --
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
I paid you back.
Braces?
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
When was the last time you talked to your son?
There's no asshole like you.
Go fuck myself?
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
Graduation?
Twelve.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I'm gonna start rolling --
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
-- just to clarify --
Are you asking me that?
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
Not really.
And that's what you've heard?
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
I wouldn'tve asked --
It's not your given name, right?
How long...you think?
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I AM CALM.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You on any medication?
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Yes.
I won't.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula --
What were you saying, Stanley?
Slowly or quickly?
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Will that help?
Yes.
No one else that I know?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I don't.
I think that you know.
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
What's MOW?
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
I can't.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Bottled Water?
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
Do you have that?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Alright.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
M'lady...?
My Queen...
May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Wh-- Wha--
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
A body.
Tomorrow.
You can do it.
Three days.
Go on.
We must stop him!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
It is also a place of burial.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
You dead yet?
Eh?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
You set to go -
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
What's this?
Did you start out area six?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
What?  Wait a minute -
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Speak of the devil.
Where up north?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Holy shit -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
Oh man...what happened?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I knew I could count on you.
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
You must be going somewhere.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Somebody hurt him?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
What's one way?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Run it.
Tell me now.
There has to be.
What's that?
I'll cover the back.
Not yet.
How did you come to Gateway?
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Francis? Where are you?
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
I don't want to know.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Yes.
Oh, God.
You'll let me go now?
Absolutely,
Do you have it?
It's Will Graham...
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Why do you think I called?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
'Intimate? !"
He only bit women so far, right?
What's average?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
I call him a monster.
No.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
If I were?
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will?  You could come up here.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yeah...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Are you gonna kill him?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How did it happen?
She got all right?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
You're insane.
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Twenty!
Right...
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Why Memphis?
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Then your father's a wimp.
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Excuse me, Andy...
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
Is he in his room?
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Sure...
Don't be ridiculous.
No, it's all right.
Is that...?
... Yeah.
I need an exit!  Fast!
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
Right now?
How?!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Why do my eyes hurt?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
The beginning?
What did she tell you?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Got it.
You're the Oracle?
But what?
What?
My name is Trinity.
That was a long time ago.
Should I be?
What happened?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
What are you talking about?
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Tank, you're hurt.
Look fella...this is private...
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Where to?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Nope...
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Diane, how are you feeling?
I know.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
No, she's got epilepsy.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
What was it?
Maybe, who knows.
What is it now?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
You mean it's heisted.
Just keep him quiet.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
That's your name?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
He's cute.
I know you do, darling.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Annie made them.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
...See you tomorrow night.
Thank you for coming.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
May I interrupting?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Perhaps you could remind me.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
A voice?
What'd it say?
Yeah, something he goes by --
I am now.
For how long?  And why?
I don't care.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Can't, sistah.
She knows you real self?
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Good morning, Jennifer.
What?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
I haven't.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Joe --
Whatever you do.
I appreciate you --
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
When you go, I go.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
What's it like?
What do you mean?
Uh-huh.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I'll be the judge of that.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
That's me.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Of course.
I think you know --
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm sorry --
How're you doing--?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Next week?
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Bravo.
Aw, you're tough.
Thank God.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Nothing.
What a night.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got patients coming in --
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
You said you liked me.
...We know so little about each other.
I'm sorry... um... ?
Condition?
I have no memory.
Couple days.
No, let's go.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Where'd you get it?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Yes.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Your wife?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Kill him.
Don't protect him.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Don't say another fucking word!
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
My wife.
Well, that's me.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Thank you.
I enjoy it.
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
You know it?
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What's wrong with this one?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Why are you following me?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
How'd you know I was in here?
What's wrong?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
No, you won't.
Sal Maguda.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
What's "nothing"?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Later!  Do you dance?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
What do you mean?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I forgot the napkins.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Packaging?
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Anything?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
No.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
What are you talking about?
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
How'd they get onto you?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
So lay it out, my brother...
What do you care?
What the hell did you do?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
What's in your socks?
What for?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
I'm scared.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
These guys're good drivers.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You're what?
What you got me up here for?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for anything.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Getchmis olsun
'Figgers.
Where?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Yeah. How's Mom?
For the money... )
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Just what?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
And you?
That doesn't seem so bad.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
What?
Why the suit?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
That's a great philosophy.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Lawyers?
Who?
Jeremy...
Weird shit...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
He's special.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Please.
Metaxonycha Godmani.
It's me. Can you hear me?
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Yes.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
Annie, what's the matter?
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
...have to wait.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Maybe.
Stop--stop right here.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?
Well that depends.
Your room.
Mmmm.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
You picked another winner!
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
And you're happy about that?
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
What you got there, mate?
..or hard wired..
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
What if I pay the rent?
Where's the bloody -
I wouldn't do that.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Are you okay?
No.
No.  Should I?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
That simple, huh?
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Do I?
To friends.
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
Krieger.
Where were you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
You didn't have to.........
Go ahead.
Whoís dead?
I donít think so.
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Youíre in Prague?
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Kittridge.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
On what?
It's quite out of the question.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Where exactly is it?
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Jack.  Jack.
The package is in the open.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Would you remove your hat please?
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Abort.  Thatís an order.
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Cosmo?
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I have my eyes open.
I'm getting married.
I didn't give you away the first time.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
You're my father.
Why you looking around so much?
Yes. Do you want...
That's it.
Loretta. What's that smell?
Bus hit him.
When you get engaged?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Stupid.
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
She was right to leave me.
Yes.
I'm a wolf?
What are you doing!
No!
Because I have no Luck!
I was dead.
I've got you.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I've never seen a moon like that.
Take it easy.
What?
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
It's the best thing there is.
Awful?
I'm really afraid.
Let me go home.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Yes?
What do you mean?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Seven-thirty.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A month from today?
Who is he?
You have a brother?
How was your plane ride?
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
What?
How's the mother?
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Alright.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
So.
Where is she?
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
No idea.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
No.
People home.
I'm a little cold.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
...What?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
The same!
All right!  What do you want?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Come on then.
Hello.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Ni!
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Too late.
Where?
It is the rabbit.
Oh, shut up.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
I'm getting better!
I feel fine.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is the capital of Assyria?
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Do you want to come and have a drink?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
But I don't like her.
Who are you?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Sir Galahad!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
They're all saying the word ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Seventy a year.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
What are you doing?!
You watch your tongue.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I wish to see my mother.
Whom you address.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I'm fine.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Why do you think I keep her here?
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Mr Brown.
What are those?
I am told so.
Who by?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
To keep out the cold.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
John?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
This is my good John Brown.
Should we take it seriously?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
What's her excuse this time?
I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
Has he been hurt?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Where is my son?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
I'm in the middle of it...
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
What are you looking for?
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Yes...
But I don't understand...
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
It means she's screwed up.
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
You're broke!
It's been a very strange day.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
I'll speak to someone.
Okay, I'm thinking.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
One.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I told ya.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Yes, there was.
Was anyone hurt?
What is it Rita?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Mulholland Drive?
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
I'm all right.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
And who are we auditioning for today?
What's  the matter now?
This Denny's.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
So, you came to see if he's out there?
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Hardly.
No...
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
What about Matt ?
Leave him, he's dead.
So what do we do ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
I wanted to let his family know....
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
What are you DOING here ?
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Where ?
Don't.
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Then what do you want ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
Will he make it out ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you writing a poem?
People said she looked like me.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
This is California, anything is possible.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Hi Dad.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
I will. How's Shelly?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Hi.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
Don't wake up Vada.
Vada.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Boyfriend?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Never heard of her.
What do you think?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Nick?
Write me a poem?
Muh??
Ten bucks.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
Committed?
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
Maybe.
Oh...what's that?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Good morning.
You couldn't?
Sort of?
Oh, sure okay.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
What do you mean?
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
What?
Can't you see it?
Stiffs??
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Oh, how do you mean?
Did she ever see Vada?
How's it going chef?
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
You never cared before.
What??
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
No, no no....
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
For this class?
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
No.
Probably.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
He's allergic to everything.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
I think it should be outlawed.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Oh no!  UUH.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
No, I don't wanna.
It's my mother.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
You're right, let's knock it down.
I am running faster!!
I don't like her.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Well, let's spit on it.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
You flew all the way h...
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Zit cream?
Ben Gay.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Can you watch the road?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
And loving him means loving all of this.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
I've missed a step.
About Michael's job.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Exactly.
Well, somet...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Michael? What ha...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
Does that make it right...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
It's not just a gag, huh?
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
How is she?
What's he running for?
Where'd he ever see us?
President?
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
She's in Paris.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Well, he's really amazing.
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
Oh... Well.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Yes, it is --
How long have you been with them?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
No, I don't.
Linnea?
I don't know who you are.
Wow!
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
I knew when I first met you.
Older.
I'm twenty-eight
That's unkind.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
Fifteen minutes?
What...?  0h, yes.
Linnea?
You're not.
Sleeping.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Probably a little too long.
Come on back to bed.
What do you think of him?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Where are you from?
You always live there?
I know a couple.
You want a ride into town?
It's not bad.
That's what Tim said.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Not good.
Yes.
Yours.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
I'm sure we will.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
No.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Hypnotizing.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, no.
And where do you keep Mickey?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
I can't do that. Five guys.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Want to talk to you.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
Went to college, huh?
Yes, aren't you?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
How about another beer?
How d'you mean?
I wouldn't have let you.
'Been up north?
Goin' to see my kid.
I'll see you later.
Four.
Hi.
Okay, I guess.
How about it?
Don't call them that.
He could live with us.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
You didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
What about your boy?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
About ten dollars.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Don't do that!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Duff, I love you.
There's nothing to say.
What's so hot 'round town?
Like what?
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
No thanks, Lee.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Guess it's never been easy.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
I understand.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
I ain't drunk, honey.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Since when?
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Take this off.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What about her?
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Did you trace it?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Never heard of him.
Yo.
Where the hell have you been?
You're late.
You haven't got it?
Case.
What?
What's my end?
What is it?
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Holy shit...
I gotta know... did it work>
What the fuck... are you serious?
On a good run... yeah.
You okay?
I know.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
What is with this school and prom?
Oh, man! Who told?
Leave.
Well excuse me.
Yeah.
Anita!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Do you even know these kids?
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Oh my god.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Rufus?
Well, are you here with anybody?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Wow - I-
Not at all!
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
I know.
Taste it.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Where are you going?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
How come?
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
You mean a shithead.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
What's all this.
Any ghosts in here?
Disappointed?
About what?
What is it - What's wrong?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
'Morning.
So, school going alright?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Hi, guys.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I gotta stay up, Max.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
So?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
I don't know...
You got five minutes.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Oh God.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
Sorry.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
The truth.
What are we going to do?
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
What are you talking about?
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
God, that's an enormous arse.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Films mainly.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hello.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Okay -- fine.
Whoopsidaisies.
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
No, you were brilliant
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
My son's name is Johnny?
You know what they say about men with big feet?
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Well...
I don't know what happened.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Can I have your autograph?
The movie star?
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Bella -- this is Anna.
In a depressingly asexual way.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Is this your first film?
Ahm... room service.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
The others?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Any more announcements?
What?
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Which floor?
Yes.
I was in luh-love with her.
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yes, ma'am...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yeah?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Welcome back.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
That's okay, kid...
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
God Bless America.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
No!
Why not?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
He's not!
I see...
That's correct, Doc ...
I'm afraid not.
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
How do ya know that?
What's going on?
Yeah!
Ten bucks.
Oh yeah...
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Hi.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
What kind of crap is that???
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What for?
Were they pen pals?
No.
Your great aunt.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
We'll KNOW.
But Faith--
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Damon Bradley...
How could you do this to me?
You're limping.
If it's any of your business, yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
What?
So?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Hi, Peter.
Oh.  That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What?
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Hi.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Been here long?
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Faith, this is my mother.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Why don't you ask him?
Come on, it's not so bad.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
No...  I can just tell.
I have vacation time coming to me.
What are you doing?
Ah ha!...
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
I'm hungry.
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
I meant about my idea.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
I know, but...
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
And he is living proof.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
A porco?
It's siesta.
How old are you?
You miss me?...
No, why?
Right.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She's not here.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
That was the idea.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's— 
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
Wow... .
See! You don't understand!
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
You training to be a nun or something?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Do you like pigeons?
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Listen, you like beer?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
Terry— what's happening to you?
You... .
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
I want to see you, Terry.
You go to hell.
You can!
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
What?
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Really?
Raise a hand to me and... .
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
Those creatures..!
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
You mean...!
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
You didn't visit him in prison.
He'd call every once in a while.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Just that she got away.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Jack?
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Half for doing what?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Who?
I'll need a last known address.
There a problem, Foley?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Who's sitting here?
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
If I could have a little more room.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
How many was that?
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
None of your business.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
You like bourbon?
Love it.
Well, does it make sense to you?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You really wear that suit.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
Weren't you expecting us?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
You don't remember me, do you?
But you're sure we've met, huh?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
Why's that?
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
He said he stayed here last November.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
It's beautiful.
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
So?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
Thank you...
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You're Walker, right?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Where's that lizard?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Didn't you say test the limits?
Yeah.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
You hear my okay?
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
How's everything?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Have the planes made it to China?
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
How do you like my hair?
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
They're waiting. Come on.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
And we're here on the couch...
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Oh yeah?
Looking good out there.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
What do you know about classical music?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Charlie? Was I dead?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Oh, God, Dion.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Is that one of your poems?
I'd love to.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
I thought I knew everything about him.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
I have a note.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Sort of.
What about?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What do you mean?
I'm not the maid!
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
What was?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You're giving me the creeps.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Give me some credit, will you?
Wbat're you talking about?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
What are you doing?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
What's the matter?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
What?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
He pissed me off.
Is this a good spot?
I know, Mom.
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Allright. Calm down.
K-R-O-one.
Aren't you giving an exam?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
What's that mean?!
I'm not going to die.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Take it easy, Walter.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Innocuous?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Sure. It's fine.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Uh huh...
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
We proceed, representing your estate.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Really?
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
That's right.
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Right.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
You're the asshole, buddy.
How many gays do you know?
Duh...
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Going on... like...?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Oh, Lord....
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
You barely know them.
Like the light is scalding it.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
Big Evil?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
How much you weigh, Johns?
Why did I fall on you?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
I don't suppose....
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Imam. Slow down.
The sled as a shield....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Not if I'm the one.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Not a star-jumper.
What, it's broken?
The best. But we won't need them.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
The blood transfusion.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
It's probably wrong --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
The evidence was very meager --
Got your sensors?
Yo!
Which direction?
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
long pause) You know it.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
But I'm not prepared to die.
She comes along too.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
I told you not to bring the other one.
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Stop right there.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
We can't.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Like you, I find it difficult.
This is his assertion.
He doesn't know.
Bunker...
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Says he can't walk.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Vancouver, B.C.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Okay. You win.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Dance?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
So have I.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
That, and the fun of it.
In a way.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Do you think I was faking?
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Ale. I don't mind.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
If I understand what you meant by that.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Very ridiculous.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
What will they do to you?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Got the information on you?
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
What's a buzzer?
How about a cup of coffee?
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You asked me where it all came from.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Lay off, can't you?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
I don't think you locked your door.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
I'll know when I find it.
Was that about the right angle?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
You can find out.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
Oh nothing.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
I don't understand.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I told you she's just..
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Yes.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Thank you.
I'm not sure I can face it.
How's Mary?
Are you going to have coffee?
Freshman and sophomores...
Thank you.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
You don't trust me.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't seen much of you.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Jeremy phoned this morning
What did he want?
Not yet you know any of these people?
To the Fleet.
It's shit.
Let me see.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Ha ha...
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Hello.
What about the Cromwells?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Not bad.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
Oh no!
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
How you figure?
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
What's this?
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Why should I?
What?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
Sorry.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Shrimp and fries.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Look at you.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Why us?
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
I think it's Hawkins.
Your uncle will like this.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Of course.  How much?
I'm not just talking about sex.
This isn't a date.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
What if I lose it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
My what?
Cynthia's not coming?
I'm here.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Yes...
You're being ridiculous.
I'm up.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
'Lo.
He... he just does.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Then you would use your--
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Having a good time, Vivian?
What?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Then I'm here till I die?
Should I be?
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
Can you move at all?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
I will never doubt again.
We'll never survive.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Why is that, do you think?
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
He's really very short on charm.
It's you.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
What? What?
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
-- anything you want --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Sorry.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You are wonderful!
I must know.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
You know what a hurry we're in.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Your grandfather's here.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Assume away!
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
You found a flop!
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
What is she gonna do here?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Maybe it's not true!
No way out.  No way out.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
No kidding?
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Yes.  We would!
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
You, Blum go Motel.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
We can't play today?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
I solemnly swear...
The Graf Spee...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
I mean in show business.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
What?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Tell me all about her.
How early?
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
I'm Mary's sister.
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
I ought to call the police right now!
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Where... can I stay?
Where's the old highway?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Probably on his way back right now.
Sam.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
Sorry.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
Can you?
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
I'm thinking of it.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I'd like to.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Thank you, Norman.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Norman took a wife?
Yes.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Yes.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You didn't find anything.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Did she talk?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
That's it. You get it quick.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Well, news of Buckley?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What were you dreaming about?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
So that's the way it is?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
But it was really my fault.
What do you think I am?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
And they never proved anything against him.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Let it go.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
No kiddin'.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Cry-baby?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
You weren't going with her?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
You go in for dangerous things.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
To lunch.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Mia...?
Could you?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
Yes?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
What'd you do, Rose?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
What was your mother like?
I don't know.
What do you think, Brother?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
The new girl is here.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Yeah.
What are they doing, Doll?
He had his hand on her titty.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Why is it taking so long?
How could that be, son?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Please do.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Turn up your hearing aid.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
She will succeed.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Is she all right?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Is anything wrong?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
"A.D."
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Hey...
What the... ?!  What was that for?
No, we're stealing.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
I... I think I can... clarify...
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Yeah... great.
We got him.
Been waiting long?
Come again... ?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
The gang's all here!
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
The same as always.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
I'm sorry.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
What did he say?
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
What do you remember?
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Janet.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
Right!
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
Maybe we could try it this way.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Hello.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
It's Thanksgiving.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I should leave.
I always knew you was pretty.
Sharp -- Real nice.
Apollo?
...I dunno.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Why?
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
My side.
You're hurtin', man!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
...Still don't feel no heat.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Of wa?
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
What's ya name again?
What about for food an' stuff?
Ya still light seventy.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Excuse me.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Ya puttin' me on?
'Bout an hour ago.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Whatta you get outta this?
Real good.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Would you keep goin'?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Help what?
Whatta you think?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Ya really like her?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Surprised?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
You shot Roger.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Why, what is Tybalt?
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Well what shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Well, what was yours?
I will follow you.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
What wouldst thou have with me?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Do you have it?
We kept it...
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Well I don't!
So where do you go from here?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
From Interpol?
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Nobody's saying they don't.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
That fucking figures...
There's been a slight problem.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Then where is it?
And you respect him.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Long enough to shoot back.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
What a surprise...
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
He trusts you to lock up?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
I wanted to see who you were.
What's going on?
It was at that.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
You know him?
You sure your friend got the right place?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Right now?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Why's that?
You slept with her!
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Ready to roll, partner?
What the hell...
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I've got one condition.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
What are you talking about?
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Uh huh.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
What for?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
What's wrong?
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
Nothing happened?
Great...
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Sally, do you love me?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Why?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Hmmm...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh...C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
At least around here it does.
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
There was more than that.
Not in the trunk.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
How much is that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Is this about the funny money?
How'd you know?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
No.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
You're not very good at this, are you?
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He'll be back soon.
Excuse me?
Slow down, baby.
Wait!  There's people down there!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
What's a Chinese heaven?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Red Dragon.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
We made it, man.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
A little Mu-shu.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
What's going on?
I need your help.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
Sir, I can explain.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
He was just doing his job.
Beach Boy.
You speak English!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
I know a shortcut.
The license!  You get it?!
Did you make the plate?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Excuse me?
Oh no, I dropped it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
You don't like it?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Shut up!
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You sonuvabitch.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Really?
Good one!  Thanks.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Maggie!
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Yeah.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
And you are?
I think you'd look good in red.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
They made me put my hat back on.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Really?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
I don't know.
Of course.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Excuse me?
Yes.
I'd rather not.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
Does it matter?
Lighten up, wahine.
He's going to be the pastor?
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
What?
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Nope.
You take the microwave?
What am I going to do with a microwave?
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
And then I'll see you in New York --
You go.
About forever.
You should write something about this.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
What?
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
I love that dream.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Please --
What?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
It's probably just the flowers --
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
You don't like the one he was now?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Yeah.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you want a fruit plate?
What?!
Dad, I don't know about this one --
P.  Dad?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
-- a slice of pizza --
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
What was?
Great.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Did you call that radio station again?
Are you going with her?
Okay.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Do you like baseball?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Hi.  Sam?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Hi.
I thought you were never going to call me.
Is he there?
No thanks.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Why are they singing, Mama?
They are singing for me.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
They say I am no good to you.
What makes you so sure?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Can be what?
Be still ...
Tell me.
Hunting.
Sun up.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Are you Australian?
No.
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Then leave.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
What are you hiding, Danny?
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Nice day
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can I ask you something?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
What does that mean?
Can we talk price?
If you say so.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
He's the only one I told.
When is the deal going down?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
You think that's a good idea?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In West Fork?
Yep.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
In the shadow by those two trees.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
How about that jeep?
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
GO!
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
I think you're right, Keith.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
There's always a bright side.
Sure, what do you want to know?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
So, where are you from?
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
Demolition, right?
How fast?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Gee, it's easy.
C'mon, just do it.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Did you sleep with her?
Meaning?
Wait a minute.
I can put that together.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
What are you doing?
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Okay, I give up.
Lloyd?
I like him a lot.
I swear to god.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Honey, about what?
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
This is me telling you about me.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Keymaster?
Thank-you.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Me?  Sure I do.
Come on.
Yes.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
You're shaking.
Then why are you shaking?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
We'll see.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
I'm sorry.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
One more time would be nice.
Okay.
How's it going?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
You're freaking out here man.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
I don't know.
It's not a charade, all this?
Should I stay?
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
He's important to my business.
It's good business.
Of course I'm on it.
Yeah, okay.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
How you feeling, all right?
Pistols?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Yes.
I think it's too late.
Four hundred, four fifty -
There will be generations because of what you did.
They've broken their pattern.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Who is this?
Why would you wanna do that?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I did that.
What?
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
She dumped me.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
No. This is a set up.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
I see you read the book.
Meaning?
Don't worry...
What do you mean?
No, wait...
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
Yes, goddammit!
Easy black boy.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
..it's really about family and tradition...
Do you want to die?
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
You ass.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
What kind of a game?
Nope.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Jesus Gale what happened?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Where are you Dewey?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Always.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Geez.
No really?
Basements creep me out.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
What?  What movie?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
W-what do you want?
Who is this?
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
Yeah?
You ready to party hard tonight?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
It's on the table.
Oh it did?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Uh-huh.
I don't understand...
Who is this?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
You getting scared?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Where are you?
Please don't do this...
Come on, yes you do.
No it's not. It was Jason.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Sidney's father?
What are you doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Afraid not.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Jesus...
I'll look for it.
Please. You owe me.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
You're evil.
Can you knock?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
Jesus, this place is packed.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
The official term is "psychotic".
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I thought you dumped her for me.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
A woman...
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
How's that?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You go to movies at least?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
Punishing.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
And so what?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Him?
You got to be kidding.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
I'm fine.
He's preaching.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Stay with him.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
This painting...
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
You should look into private schools.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
I say NO!
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
That's what I said.
Keep talking.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
What you want me to call you?
You want us to fire a shot if...
Because she's my...my...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Futterman?
You ask her!
I think maybe we oughta...
What's that got to do with us?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
I got your boy killed.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Martin, it's not funny!
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
What?
Hello.  Can I help you?
I've killed my husband!
And the title of this piece?
You did not like the speech?
Oh
You are a gentleman.
Tomorrow.
What is the chief part?
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
Nothing comes.
No, your marriage bed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Will it restore my gift?
I have a wonderful new play!
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised!  Locked?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Fifty pounds? What for?
Cut round him for now.
What is the story?
Ethel.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
And--?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
I have lost my gift.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Master Shakespeare
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Oh my lady, my love!
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
You never spoke so well of him.
You cannot marry Wessex!
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
I have spoken with your father.
I do not love you, my lord.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Where did you learn how to do that?
Do you understand me?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
"Poet?"
How do I offend, my lord?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Is there a man?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
Serve.
He made it clear.
Only on expenses.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
He's still here.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
I don't know.
What does it look like?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes.
Well, yes.
For the flat.
Alex.
What I am.
Hugo.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Did what?
I don't want to. It's different.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
No, no, it's different.
I don't see the point in that.
He can't stay up there.
Expecting anyone?
It's the only way.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Can you afford this place?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
What about?
Downstairs.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Two?
Who said there were four?
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you know many of these people?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
No.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
It wasn't like that.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Hello.
What guy that died?
Writing seems easy.
Did he sound upset?
A certain weakness.
Yes.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Maybe... why do you ask?
That you were just indulging me.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- is that what this is all about?
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What're you doing later?
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Want me to?
You know what I'm talking about.
No.
Her?
Shit.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
No shit.
Yeah...
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Pardon me?
You're late, George.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Probably the bathroom.
Jill's coming with us.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah, baby...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
You were great.
You were great.
Where do you want to go?
Look who's talking.
God, there's Lester...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
Yeah?...
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
Not yet.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
How are you, baby?
What?
I am?
When can I talk to you?
No, but I think they might.
What do you want?
Who?
What business meeting?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Yes.
Did you?
-- A wash and set.
In a way. But...
Sorry, honey, I...
I know it, I know it.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Oh yeah...
All right, who're you with? Jill?
You're home.
What do you mean?
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A daytime soap opera.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Poster-Kleiser.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- uhh-huhh...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Johnny!
Good for you.
That bastard.
You're kidding.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
No.
No!
No of course not.
I'm hungry.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
You mean they ate each other up?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Yes, Dad.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I guess so.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Because he hides.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
And, er... where are they now?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Hi, babe.
Sure is.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Any ideas yet?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes, I did.
Jack!
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me,
Stay away...!
I'm not going to hurt you.
five months of peace is just what I want.
I'm intrigued.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
I'd better collect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Hi.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Are you all right, Marty?
No.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
What?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Do I need one?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
You want to know what I think?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Oh?
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
Really.
You know, I just might!
SING!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
You are so damn sexy.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
What? 
Good evening, Vincent.
Oh my! 
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
What?
Shirelles.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
What?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
She won't?  Why not?
Bobs
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Run!  Take off!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Your name?
Sit down.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
What's a concubine?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
You saved my life.
And if I don't?
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
And if she runs?
Neither did you!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
We've got to save her!
Sister Mary Patrick?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
He's decent.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
It's so beautiful...
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
We must be a curious sight to him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
What?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
It is sacrilege!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Very few, if any.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Where are we going?
It's spectacular.
No, I couldn't...
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
My suitor?
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
If you want.  But...
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Why would you do such a thing?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
And this gives worth to butchery?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
You... you are alive.
He rides tonight.
Father saw you die.
I don't reckon.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
You have any biscuits for sale?
Did you decide, sir?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
What are all them books?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Yeah.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Maybe they needed it.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Naw.
Yeah.
Why?
So it died when it come out?
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Huh?
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
You walk fast, don't you?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Yes sir.
I'll be.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
What about me?
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
No, we have to get this story.
Before they were married?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
What!
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
I'd love to.
What about for you?
What's that, Sol?
The Queen of England?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
For keeps?
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
What can I do for you?
And you told your nephew about it?
And?
What's your offer?
Well what?
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Mostly what.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
The what?
Here and there. Around.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
He's dead?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Eight-thirty?
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
No way.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
His only copy?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
Now, Mister Gi...
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
You think so?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
It is.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
For certain, no.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Improved...how?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Okay. 
I'll say.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
You mean it's a girls' band?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Fight it.
Good night, Daphne.
What happened?
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like right after the ceremony.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Get me Room 414.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
What'll I tell him?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
What's that?
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
No!
Thirty-four.
Where did you girls play before?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
You're leading again.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
I don't care.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
Oh?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
What's the job?
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Then why did you take this job?
Yeah.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
You are?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Not at all.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
I'm not interested at all.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
- opening of the Opera -
- riding to hounds -
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Why?
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
You heard her - yes.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Love it.  Which way?
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
I don't mind if I do.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
What's on Thursdays?
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Have you tried?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Is it that hopeless?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
Good night.
Really?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I come to the old lady's funeral.
PLEASE!
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Go where?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
I had to say something to get you here.
You heading to the train station?
No, tell me.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
That was a long time ago.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
You’re funny.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
It’s cute.
Would you grab my shampoo?
There’s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
Subtle?
Is this for last night?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Oh, no. He told you.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
You pawned it.
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Yeah.
“Not yet...”
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
You don't live around here, do you?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
What he talk 'bout?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
But where is my daddy!?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
No, Miss Johnson...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
It was too dark, Daddy.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
When's that?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
You got two shirts on?
What is it, David Lee?
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Tired.
There, you see?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Montana.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Mph rmph rm!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Thank God, that sucked ass.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Oh no, it's that kid.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Donkey raping shit eater.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh my God...
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Oh, brother.
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Oh dear God...
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
What if I just left?
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
So...
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
So, are you on for the next one?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
You gotta think of your old age.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Taylor?
Yeah?
I'm not going with you.
I'm in the bridge.
So close...
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What the hell is that?
The pin machine?
You a mini-golfer?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
No kiddin'.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
What's on your mind, Miles?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
What the fuck is this?
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Don't tell me, John.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
How Mr. Kastle?
After we eat, Dad.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
So, what about you?
Come on, bargain with me.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
What about plan C?
Sez you!
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.
Get out of there!
Back away then.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Geologists?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
She should've known better.
When was this?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Wait a second --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
What caused it?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
Some sort of lead or something.
We had considered it.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
What about you?  What happened to you?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
So what?
Four days?
In case you die, too?
But I don't know how --
What's the matter?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Still clear?
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Something for burns.
I'll just boost the doses.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Someone did.
You manifested that, Beth.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Hear what?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
For who?  The fish?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Like what?  I'm not --
Don't be defensive.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Page 87 of what, Harry?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Beth left?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
But why would she -- ?
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
C'mon, Norman!
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
You want me to try?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, he's polite.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
What?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
How much do you think she's talking about?
Is that good or bad?
Who are you anyway?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
How can you store an energy field within you?
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
Are you all right?
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
You don't believe in the Force?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Did you read her mind ?
How do you make him do that ?
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Johnny, wait...
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Carl can wait.
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Should I be ?
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
C'mon...
All bands.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Hi, mom.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
What do you think you're doing ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
Yes.
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Mmm.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
...lost the screw...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
Hi.
Sleep well?
Yes...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
What is it all about?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Big day last night.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
How big is this horse?
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Mornin, sister.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with...
What...
You can go...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
You guys had better leave us a...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
There's other things to be learned.
I wasn't in the car.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Yeah.
Yes, yes, but...
What...?
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
What?
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
I have to talk to you.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
He told you that...
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We're out of money.
I don't drink.
Why?
I'm gonna nail it.
I've got a date.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
My oh my.
You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
We got the permit.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
There's no witnesses...
Mmm.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
And we're glad to have you here...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
It takes all kinds.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
...we can't lose the wind...
I don't care.
Like who?
That will never happen.
I'm gonna call him.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Wow.  Who's that for?
I can't hear you.
I said...
You don't like his friends.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Not with my mouth open.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Yes.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...

Great.  Big ears, too?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
No they're not.
You touched it.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Queen of diamonds.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
That I do.  Always will.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --

Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
I'm here.
Something's up wi...
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Me too.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Yeh?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
However many.  It's not enough.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Look, you've never liked me...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
Small world.
Oh, my God.
And you said...?

And you said...

See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You're the hip and fresh.
For what?
Rache, get out of th...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
Restless.
What if he is?
Marty, ignore him.
He was in a concentration camp?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Nice to have you here.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Yes.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Who is Jesus?
He's dead.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Marty...
We used pull.
Sure!...
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Oh. What happens now?
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
OK.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Thanks.
Hey, Mikey!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
What are you doing here?
You're not.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Hello, is this Pam?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I do.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
How many?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Thanks.
I know.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Prnceton.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
I said I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Well Filmore--
It's nothing to worry about.
Enjoying the tour so far?
Go fuck yourself...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
What!
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
We can't--it's power driven!
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Where are you trying to reach him?
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
My seven body orifices????
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
So what?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Do you recognize my voice?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
A shooting war!
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I'm trying to, sir.
Where, sir?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
I presume the planes are armed?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Yes?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Check.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Master safety.
Yes, Major.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Forget it.
Intense.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Hey, you said you did a video?
A cloud.
A cloud?
Any gunshot victims?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Where are you-hoo?
Stuck with what guy?
It's your birthday?
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No, I'm not worried.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Erica is in the van back there.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Guess not.
Am I fucking him?
I'm so burnt-out.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
It's okay.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Thanks. See man?
Yes!
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Hi.
What'd he get you?
Mm.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Military marching bands.
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Two-fifty.
Can you tell me what happened?
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
You lied to me.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Jeff! Come up here!
Look, why do you care, huh?
You could've come over.
Your sure as hell right about that.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Of course I do!
But do you stand for anything?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
What feelings?
Of course.
Nothing.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Well, what about us?
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
So you think I should?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Look, get down off my property.
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
No, this has everything to do with you.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Is that Jeff?
It's none of my business?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah?
Just one?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Could you give me a ride?
I'm going out later.
You know the fuck not.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
No.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Let me explain something...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
That you?
Yeah, hold on.
You want us to help you pick up?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Is that you down there?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
You forgot this.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
What about all those ideas you had?
We're engaged.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
It's just impossible.
You're tough, all right.
Good.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Hello, Betty.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Fair enough.
They'll love it in Pomona.
You can stay here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
What are the notes?
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
And she's turned you into a servant.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
How's that about your being my friend?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But which one?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
I think I'd better keep it.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
And now?
Are you asking me for a "date"?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
How do I fight it?
No!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Do you have any theories about last night?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Nigel, get lost.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Where is inner space?
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Why?
Then come with me.
Mr. Roebush?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Too much mayonnaise?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Say!
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Kitchen. . . Technician
Thirty-five.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Say what?
Which country?
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Ricky?  Where...what...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
We've already met.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
53.
It could make weather!
Today coffee----
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
It's true. It's true.
I didn't think I wanted to.
We'd better talk.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Does Lois know about this yet?
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
I like trees.
Genius!  --  Lex.
What's a curl?
Now This I want to hear.
My kind of people.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
He has powers as we do . . .
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
I've never been in a place like this before.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Oh . . . my . . .
Any more like you back home, Clark?
Like me?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
I think he's kind of cute.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Who?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
He's . . . cold. . .
Ready, Uncle Lex?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
He's thirty-five years old.
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mother...
Unbelievable.
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Super...man. Hmmm...
Again???
You think he's for real?
Krypton!
Mr. Romance...
La de da da...
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Ready?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
Boy!
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
He sure as heck does that.
He is. Usually.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Oh.
It's not bad.
Where do you hail from?
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
What is this??!
They'll soon be over.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Ally Jones.
Then...when did she get better?
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
He knows that?  Billy?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
Isn't it a lovely day?
So do you like your new room?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Yes.  It's a present.
From you?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Tell me about it.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Do you have the blood test?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Dolores?
You think someone else caused the accident?
How does the family survive?
You remember that much?
You are?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Why not?
How do you like it, Nicole?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
How will he do that?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
Great.
Will the police do anything to her?
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Did she accept?
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Can I come out?  No.
Can I come in for a minute?
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I don't?
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Uh huh.
How?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Talk to her, Sidney...
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
He goes out with girls.
I don't think so.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
What sort of thing?
This sort of thing!
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
What's the matter?
Why not you?
You're talking very fast.
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
I didn't do anything!
You haven't told him yet...
I made you write a beautiful song...
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
What chip?
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Liquid metal.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
You have to do what I say?!
Everything.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Drive for a minute.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
No shit?
We're better off by ourselves.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Why attack Russia?
I must be destroyed.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Mine's the Eleventh.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I was warned.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
No!
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
This is absolute nonsense!
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Do you know what that is?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
The Miracle Kid.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Sure.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
You were in insurance before the war.
First oboe.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
What do you think?
I hate the beige one.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
That's none of your business.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
I volunteered.
What about it?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Hot dogs?
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
So much pain.
What are you doing?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
This is nuts.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
What are you talking about?
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
You deserted me.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
Can we talk?
Take the picture out.
Get out of my car!
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Who is it?
What are you doing?
Stop talking to them!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Originally, Connecticut.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
They'll be wanting it back.
Fun?
Okay.
Will you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Is there a room key?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Goodnight.  See you home.
The Hinchberger wedding.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
You're not telling us something.
Well, this lot is full!
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
All night?
You want company?
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
No.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
Sorry.
All right...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You know what he's really upset about?
This is where we're going?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Who?
Why'd she kill herself?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
What's his first name?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
What.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
No reason.
Huh?
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
Boomerang.
Y'what?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
What?
What's so fucking funny?
No one else is even here yet.
You goin' back inside?
Steady on.
He's gotta know why.
Do you have any friends, man?
Didn't get it.
You just cooking then?
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Sort a few things out.
It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
How'd you manage that, then.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Something like that, yeah.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
It didn't discourage you, though.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
He alive to see this?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
It was you.  Downtown.
Eh?
Where is he now?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There is?
He's expecting you?
Where is he, then?
-- You know his name is Frank.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Thanks.  You, too.
Tell you ...
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Birdy--
...she can go up there.
I'll have it in a week.
...You bring a check?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
But it's...
So?
You don't have to--
Should I... should I tell you why?
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
I don't know. I don't think so.
So... who... who actually--
Uh-huh.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
The sub-basement?
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
What's going on?
I'm coming with you.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
We're not supposed to go back there.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Oh no.  I smell it.
What kind of egg is it?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Where would we find it?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Dr. Green...
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
Genetic damage?
What is it doing?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I don't believe it.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why is he in the basement?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why would we--
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Marlon--
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Who were you talking to?!
How's your hip?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Good.  Good.
We don't even know you.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
What's that?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
And what's that?
He just let it explode.
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
You found something?
What?
I think they have that covered.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Scully...
Scully, I found the bomb.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
I'd been told as much.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
You think they went left?
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Very weird.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Scully....?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
Just like that --
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Cold...
We're going to the morgue.
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Our vaccine may have no effect!
He hates me.
Miriam...
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
Yes mother.
Damn him.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Where the hell are we?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Nervous?
What about the cat?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
How is she?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Den leuten.
They're forged.
What's that?
Tell me more.
It's just what he used to say.
We're both in it, Harry.
He liked to laugh.
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
Just around the corner.
Been here long?
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Listen, Callaghan.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Well?
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
What time is it?
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
No, a major, were you really?
What about?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Striptease, sir.
Listen...
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
...give evidence.
The Roumanian?
Harry...
That's all you meant?
...this time.
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
What do you think you're doing?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
What do you care?
Why the fuck not?
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
What's he care about?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
I want to learn to read it.
Why?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Where are they?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
What'd you say?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What??!?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
Of course they're Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
I don't think you know what you are.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
What about chicken?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Which one were you aiming at?
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Where?
How did you know they were Jews?
We tested the new bomb.
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
Did you tell him?
Did the driver really freeze?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Good afternoon.
Hello!
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Congratulations.
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Roberto?  How long?
What about the shoes?
What's with the voice?
And... does the voice come back?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
I dove 315 feet!
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Well, what are they?
Not at all!
Why?
Everything about what?
Two years younger than you.
I'm concentrating.
Absolutely positive.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
You want to lie down for a while?
Why?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Well... here.
Louis, we were French!
Again?
How was your trip?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Who... Who is that?
Wait!  Professor...?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Yes Esther.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Keep going.
We do!
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
What are you doing?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Good looking?
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
I don't know.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
No.
It was you.
It's better you don't know.
Tormented -- ? Why?
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
Wait ——
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Yes. The lipstick.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
Who is he?
I know. Funerals.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
I know -- Teresa -—
When will they be back?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Disney! How inter...
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Aren’t you curious to know about Friedman?
You’re mad...
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Leon hung himself...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
You don’t say.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You splendid bastard...
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
Croissants.
The word for those things is croissants.
You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I know where to look.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
No... No...  I swear...
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Am I supposed to know him?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
What is?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
I’m sorry...
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
The acid bath?
If he had, you’d be dead.
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
What do you mean?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
I would like some fresh straw.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Who do they think I am?!
The king said you're his finest archer...?
What... what do you mean?
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
But... why... what's the point?
Jeanne's alive!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I tried to.
I don't know...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
Am I... am I dead?
God defeated the English, not me.
The English??
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
If there was, I didn't see it...
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Yes, it's a miracle.
No... not like this...
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
I need to confess again.
Whose were they?
Yes, it is.
Hello.
I'll be fine.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Henryk's in there.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
I can look after myself!
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
I was listening, Kitten.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Szpilman.
Careful! Watch his hand.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
The Alps.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What's in here then, lead?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Play a gig.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
I'm out, Johnny.
We cleared 22 here.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
What do ya want the others to get?
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
You mean you blew it.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
We'll get by without 'em.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
You just worry about your end, kid.
And?
It was too noisy.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Raise 1,000.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
Who are you?
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
You got the 400 grand yet?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
You want a drink or something?
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
What?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Give it to me.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Yes.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Shrapnel!
Nothing.
What do you mean?
What about this Nunheim?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Good morning --
Where were you?
All right.  All right.
I don't like him.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Thanks, and goodbye.
But what if you need more money?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
My wife.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
But he has nothing to do with it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
I had him out this morning.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Who's that?
No.
They were kidding you.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
But it's Christmas now.
Want a drink?
Who's that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Your guess is as good as mine.
He's just been for a walk.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I did find him!
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
Well, don't they?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
What are you going to do?
Got a nice evening dress?
The suspects!  They won't come.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
No, Mr. Charles.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Trying to put it off on her?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home!
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Not much of a pass.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You got no reason to do that!
Get off him.
What happened?
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
What are you doing?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Invest it.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What?
It's a mine, isn't it?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
This.  Whatever it is.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
Where the hell is it!?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
To where?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Well?
Epps.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
What does that mean?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Like I said; so?
If there's gold.  If!
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
I thought we were dead.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
I can't hear him.
HUMMMM.....
Look,dirt!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
No!  Don't go.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
THX and me.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
You're in violation.
When?.....How?
Which way?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
I knew him.
Remember this...?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
They're not here.
Where are they?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Go ahead.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What was-? Why...?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Fuck factor?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
It's from an IRA.
Computer device?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Jesus...
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Why are we stopping here?
What the hell was that?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
You okay?
Sir...
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
It's our only option.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
And harems ... ?
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Yes, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
What do you mean?
Monescu.
Just as you say, Doctor.
The tennis player?
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Thank you, Baron.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Certainly!
Filiba ...
Spanish passports?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Um-hum ...
Together.
Crimson!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Instantly.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Divine ...
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
I know!
About what?
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Then why did you do it?
No--I'm sorry.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
The pumps --
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
Who's the best? Say it.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
I make my own luck.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
Sure. Count me in.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
If only it were that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
She had beautiful hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Jack, I --
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
It's bad.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
I'll join you later.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Will you leave me alone?
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Yes--are you?
Like her paint job?
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Good-by!
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Tell me.
Don't be a c-a-t.
Well, I can't.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
How well do you know her?
Who with?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
No, sir?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
You take some awful chances.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
How about you?
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Hello, young fellow!
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
How?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Sure.
O.K.! Send that!
Hello, Denby!
Who won?
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Like it?
Do what--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
Thanks to me.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Why?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
What's the matter?
Nothin'.
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
He said to turn loose of him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
What's wrong, Doc?
How you feeling, Doc?
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
What?
A which?
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
No.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I need it.
That what you got me up here for?
'Least they don't scare women.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Florentino!  He's getting away!
There they are.  No herd though.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
They're carrying guns in town.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I see.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
I'd rather die alone.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Paris -
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
It must do something.
Gone fishing.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
I got you covered.
... Does this do anything?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
- Shut up!
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
Sometimes you just have to -
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
Who's in charge here?
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Fueled and waiting.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
You okay?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
It is just a regular card.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Go back to sleep.
Hush.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
You must have been really sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
How is everybody?
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You invited me.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
Those boys never did have good luck.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Where is Skip?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
What?  What is it?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Spaceship.
Woody, stop it!!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Great!
Miss.  G-6.
Heh-heh.
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Hey!!
Will you quit moving around?!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Toss 'im overboard!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Bad news?!
Woody!  Speed up!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
He's not here.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
What is he planning on telling them?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Don't bother.
Carl --
Me, too.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
I don't know.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
You do?  What else you do?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
What do we do?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Not Tiger Woods.
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Yes, sir!
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
What's your name?
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I don't know what to say.
You won't say anything to my parents?
Yes, I hope so as well.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
I'll be right after you.
Shag her senseless.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Where are you going, Diane?
It's where I live.
Ssshh!
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Because it's illegal.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
It's an interesting theory.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Do you recall the school motto?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
There's no need.
No.
You take the test?
I'm sorry, Tommy.
No, I'm clean.
Running time?
Roald Dahl.
So who else?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
It wasn't that bad.
He made me lick it.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Fuck you.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Four Grand.
Are you serious?
The Sick Boy method.
Your usual table, sir?
It's fresh air.
Six weeks.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Raise shields.
Can we have it quiet?
Bob?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
MM.?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Goodnight, Spock.
What do you mean?
Be one with the horse.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
A "t."
Spock... the booster rockets.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Now learn something about yourself.
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I know you better than that.
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok, we must find a way...
You did break in.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Did he say why?
Okay, okay...
Of what?
For what?
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
For sure...
Right on the money!
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
That was uncalled-for.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Who is your User, program?
What about our friend - Sark?
Not us, I hope.
How about you?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Why? What are you going to do?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Yes, MCP.
Do you know what he's talking about?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Where are you off to young lady?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yeah, Dad.
Dad, how come you know the words?
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Yes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Harry?  HARRY?!
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
I still don't believe it.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Give me the page.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
I thought this look like your work.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
No!  Never!
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
They must've just missed me.
Why did you continue to see him?
What?
My husband can't know about this.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Are we going to die?
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Who's your little friend?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Helen.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Did you get the letter?
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What time is it?
What do you want to know?
Where are you from.
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
You mean she got a bad batch?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
A real live pimp?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
What?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Why Cancoon?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Yeah.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.
The zoo.
What's to think about?
Clarence.
In case.
No. But thanks.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Leave the gorillas.
No.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
I can, but I don't.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
What do you want from me?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Uh-huh.
Come again?
Thank you.
Sure. No problem.
We talked him into it.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Just put it in your purse.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Well?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
They forced me to take drugs.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
Meaning...???
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
July?!
1995?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Shot!  Who shot you?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I'm not crazy.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What's that mean?
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
Christ no!
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Out of here.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
How much?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Wrong number.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Jesus.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
Like they're made of polyester.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
How much money has he got?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
He was going to--
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
What for?
The trunk.  It's locked.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
You've got to be--
Like you don't know.
Why would I kill her?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Just ran into a little trouble.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
I did?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
What should I do?
Drop it, Jake.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
That's a thick change of heart.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
How old are you?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What the hell are you talking about?
I wasn't doing anything.
They're not very imaginative?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
I didn't do anything.
But, Senor--
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Oh, Jesus.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Hell no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What?
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Mister!
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You're talking like a madman.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Next time you'll do just fine.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Look, Harlin.
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I like that about me, beautiful.
You sure you can manage?
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I didn't say it bothered me.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Like you.
Still playing?
Try me.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
What about us?
Stop it.
I could if I had Jake's money.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Morning, officer.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
"Arkady"
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Four.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I'm listening.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Okay.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan?
Yes. Is this David?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Would you like to try going--
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
In college. A car accident.
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
You've misunderstood.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
He's kind of a miracle.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
I mean if you knew karate?
No Jeremy.
That's great.
How are you feeling?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
...I got a present for you.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Free ones?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
But he was called...
And?
Is... is it... loaded?
Did you... kill him?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
He's... he's dead.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
N-no, sir?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Yeah, I guess so.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Finish him, Ned.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Eleven.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Three ways?
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
Shit.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Yeah.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Yeah?
Jack. What are you doing here?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
They want more time to think about investing.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I hope I didn't disturb you.
You are a criminal.
Get out.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You okay?
I'11 be alright.
How are they going to do it?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
with what?
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
No.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Edie.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Nothing.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
What book is that?
I did.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
No.
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
...things change.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Listen to me, fella...
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Exception!
Kathy Price.
Missus...
The TV didn't work.
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
Laura.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Isn't there something you...
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Yes.
I...do you want me to leave?
Is there going to be a later...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
No...no...
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
Hi, Mickey ...
Uh ...
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
So what?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Huh.  And why is that?
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
I want you.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Nothing.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
I told you! Right here!
Will you have dinner with me?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
But I like that one, Scottie.
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Where shall we go for dinner?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
No, Ernie's is fine.
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Some money.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
When?
Oh... wandering about.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Good-bye.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Here with you.
Where?
Yes...
Home?
Where?
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
What else?
No.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
I love you too... too late... too late...
Where?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
What is her name?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
I've never run across one like that.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Johnny!
Pop Leibel.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Here you are.
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Did you need it?
Oh... this and that.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
Well...
Jesus.
What?
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Why?
This is pathetic.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
She's got no fucking pulse.
I'm calling the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
What?
We can't do this.
How do you figure?
We have to get going.
It has worked.
No. I think it's fucked.
If anything ever happens to me...
I don't think so.
So. When is the wedding.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Where is she?
Yup.
No.
Call 911.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Nobody knows she's here.
I'm calling the police.
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
I'm serious.
You're sick.
The hell I did!
I don't hate women.
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Are we supposed to?
Government cutbacks.
The wedding cake check?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why what?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
How do you figure?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
With all my heart.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Yeah. Nesting.
Okay.
What!
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Well, can you come back inside?
We're not canceling.
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Who's dead?
You fucked a prostitute?
Move the bodies.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Everything okay?
You're not breathing right?
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
I don't hear it.
My God...
You alright?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I guess.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We will.
No, the children sleep with me.
Take me there.
You must think I'm mad.
Let me pass!
You believe me, don't you?
Yes.
How much is that?
That's it.
My God, what have you done to him!
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Well... is it so urgent?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Are they going to work here too?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
There's been an accident.
I'm afraid.
A black bull came.
He came in through the cupboard.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
In English, please.
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
Why would they be going there?
You all right?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Their weapons missing?
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Enough to level an entire city block.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Go to hell.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
What the hell's going on?!
What do we do now?
You and me have nothing in common.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
It's <u>producing</u>.
No, this is great.
...this is a snappy song....
...where?
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
Who we got here...?
Yes
...that's the general idea.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
...I just missed my plane.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.

What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Ask it.
To preserve their Way of Life.
...you the Press Office?
When's he coming back...?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
Better.
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
... That's what you told us to say.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Coulda been a contender.
About what?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
What are you doing here?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I don't understand.
What the hell do you want?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
How much is enough Gordon?
Hello Bud.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
Well, why stop at that?
I don't.
How you doing Buddy?
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
Anybody want another drink?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Would you like a closer look?
Thank you
Jenkins!
No?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Oh that explains everything.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
No thank you sir we're fine.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Stop saying things so loud!
That was very good.
He loves you very much.  He just--
So much.
I started seeing things.
Did you?
Why is he worried?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Have you been hurt?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Well maybe your wife...
Tell me.  I can help you.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
No, I don't.
She never mentioned her father.
He was so pissed.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
You should have heard her play.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
She's making this up.
Jody--
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Someone's there.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
But Claire--
Why?
What are you going to do?
I know.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Not the focus.
You are...
Nope.
Maybe we should just...
Why?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
He killed her.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
What am I looking at?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
When?
Norman...
What are you doing out here?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
What?
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
We walked all night...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
I may have seen her on campus.
Who?
I never asked you to quit!
Claire...
I know.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
I had you sent away.
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
What is wrong...?
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
And whose houses do you design...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Hello...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Hey - you're bleeding.
Mm-hmmm...
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
And it can't be forged?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
STEPHANIE?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
I don't like sugar
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
I thought it was you - how are you?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
That's crazy talk.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
So that's a maybe?
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
It's not up to me.
Me-ow.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
I don't get the distinction.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
I see.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
He's on the move?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I'm trembling with excitement.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You do like girls, don't you?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You were the new and improved you.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
Yes?
Talk to me Artie.
And where might that be?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
What about the blood?
And the child...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
That bothers you?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
It's those rocks, up there.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Curiosity, I guess.
Yes.
I'm here.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
Who is it?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Yes.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
How...
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Didn't you see her this morning?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
It is?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
My.  It's gotten longer.
Private train?
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Willow Ufgood.
Sorsha.
You all right?
Where's the baby??
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Who?
She's in love.
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
But what am I gonna transform??
I just wanted to test it first.
Are you sure?
She needs to be changed.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
This is not going well.
Hey, careful there!
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Are you really ever coming back?
Yeah.
Just us.
You have no right to keep us here.
They kid a lot.
Oh? Anything else?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Home.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
But Stoltzfus said...
We had some lemonade and he left.
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Where's my baggy pants?
I hear you.
You know where he is.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
You didn't have to...
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
She say where he is?
He'll live.
They are English. They don't understand.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh --
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Hickory!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Yes, I'm ready now.
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
Oh --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
We might.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Yes -- let's run!
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Where's Kansas?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Here --   Come on.
Dorothy!
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
Where do we go now?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Quiet!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh - look out.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
How can I ever thank you enough?
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
What is it?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Construction’s not exactly my line.
Old friend?
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Yes.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
I can’t stay.
What is it?
Vodka martini.
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
Where’s M?
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
And the payoff on the tables?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
No! Bond!
I’ll send someone out.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
She's with me.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Laurie --
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
That's because --
. . . That was quick.
Where's Laurie?
Coward.  Giving up.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
You do everything Yorgi says?
We hung out last night, remember?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
What are you?
I'm from L.A.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
They tell me you're an American agent.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Are you alright?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yorgi and Kirill.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Toadies right behind.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
The Peace conference...
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
For what purpose?
What's wrong with him?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Jean... can you?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
What do you want?
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Where are we going?
How?
You designed this yourself?
I felt like she almost killed me.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
It does indeed, Max.
From your office, sir.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Of course.
What a strange fellow.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
My father was a sick man.
Nineteen, sir.
I see.
Are these your bags?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Fro-derick!
Did you hear that strange music??
You can't win 'em all.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Don't fall for that one.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Can you play it?
Thanks...for all your help.
What monster?
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
Is everything ready?
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Look, Doctor!
I thought it was wonderful.
Me?  Sing?
Give him the sedative!
I think so.
Just passing through the night.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I will.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Are you ready for me?
Three minutes to go!
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
