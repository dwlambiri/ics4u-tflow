Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Cameron.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I hope so.
Hopefully.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
Why didn't you tell me?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I just wanted --
Perm?
What if she never starts dating?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
So they tell me...
You burn, you pine, you perish?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Not at all
How much?
Fine, thirty.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Block E?
Just a little.
Who?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I know a lot more than that
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Funny, you're the only one
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Sure, I do
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
I hate him.
What?
Busy
Who?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
I dazzled him with my wit
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Yeah...
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Good enough.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Make anyone cry today?
Tumescent!
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
I know.
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
Yes... I remember...
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
There'll be a time.
This time with me!
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
How did you manage it?
Father Marchena!
Damn God!
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
What did they say about Granada before today?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
Come over here.
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What's your cut?  How much?
Give me another one, please.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'll make some for us.
Pouring it out!
It was my decision, not his.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
No!  Nothing happened.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Better than one.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Hey.
I'm not.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Yes.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
We have no money.  Come on.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Credit?
Did you hurt her?
As a plumber?!
In love?  With who?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Well, he killed my partner!
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
What??
How long they been livin' here?
What the hell happened?
The clerk?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Yes.
And don't you worry about it.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Thank you, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
What do you mean?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Roger.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Sure, anything you want.
You're crazy.
Bullshit.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's never been one of my problems.
How much?
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
When? How?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
What's wrong with that?
I guess he got the message...
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
You sure you want me to?
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
So what?
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Let's go, Reggie.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shut up.
You chickenshit punk...
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Give it back.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Crystal.
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
And the third one?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Why not?
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Apipoussan!
Uh...
Protect life... Until death.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
...What do you mean?
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
I'm not accusing you...
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
You don't understand...
I don't know what to say
Amy...
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
I promised him to Machine.
A fellow investor.
Machine's in?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Eddie.
What?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Fuck you.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
See ya.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Thank you.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
That's exactly what I am.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
You could do worse.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Three days.
Then what else can we do?
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Don't worry, honey
No...
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Me too.
No.  A deal's a deal.
Had kind of a long night.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Well we gotta do something!
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I don't know!
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
So they caught up with you, too?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Somewhere down there?
Under <u>water</u>?
What direction does the system indicate?
But - what can we accomplish?
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
All right - go to it.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Twombley involved?
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
Damn straight!
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You think so.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Really.
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Sun's gettin high.
Piece of fucking cake.
In the chest.
Yeah.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I don't care. They're out.
You know.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
I don't want to.
It's stupid.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Yes.
Oh.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I want to go home.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Okay. She's fine.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Forget it.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Oh, Wade.
Good.
I know your parents.
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Marg! You got orders!
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Call it what you want.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Yeah, no duh.
Don't you even want to ask?
Alice...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice... I...
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
I prefered the terrorists.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Roger.
why did they do that?
A dubious distinction, no?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Come on, Alice.
What do you know of my husband?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Jim...
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
That isn't necessary.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
What?
Excuse me?
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
But...
who can I say is calling?
Yeah, right.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Yes, sir.
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted!
I mean until we start to burn up.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Now!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
I guess this is a first for you.
Don't be too long.
Yes, sir.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
I don't want to hear that word!
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
No.  Poached.  Over.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Do you have an appointment, sir?
All right, it's a matter of death.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Thank you. Cream?
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Ted!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
And a little ice!
You promise you'll write.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Huh?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
No. No thank you.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
My wife?  She worries about me.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
We can't let him get away.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
For you, anything.
Sure.  Just a minute.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You?
What?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
It's insured.
They're but off!  Do something!
Yes, Hicks?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Alive?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Fuckin' A!
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
You're just reading me.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Uh, what's next?
Think of what?  We're fucked.
So what do I tell this guy?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
They're dead.
You promise?
You mean dead.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Indeed.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Well, what does it matter to you?
You have leave to try.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Where?
Yes!
What are you talking about?
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi.
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
I heard voices.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
Why?
I can't write it!
Madame. How can I help you?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Isn't it obvious?
Why you?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Adorable!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Michael!
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Would you tell me why?
I have no idea.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
That's right.
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Because there's nothing to see.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
You burned the score?
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
Are you ill?
Would you? Actually, you could.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Yes.
Yes.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
On the contrary.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
Baron!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
I did.
What difference does that make?
Yes.
Incredible.
The Emperor has given him permission.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Excuse me, my dear.
How did he look?
What happened to them?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
I beg your pardon?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Aw come on, Alex!
Shall I read to you?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Lovely.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
No.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
So they said.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Good.
Right.
You're talking about the woman I love.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Come on, where?
It's circling us.
Plan?
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You must believe me.
You don't have to say anything.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Oh.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Where's Matt?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
What good will that do?
That's very simple. I was home.
Fifty thousand dollars!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
That don't do us any good.
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Cyril!
Now?
Oh, yeah?
I'm listening.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
But I haven't . . .
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Yes, sir.
What are you talking about?
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Matt, come here!
Oh now, don't be silly.
All right, dear.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
It couldn't have been earlier?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
It's tougher than it looks.
Oh no...
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
How?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
She was European!
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Twenty?!
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Both would be nice.
Strategically.
This here is the Younger Gang!
You're right, sir.
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
The posters?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
But you got big!
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Where will you find such a girl?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I think so.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Good.
How much did they get from the safe?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Oh, that's the best part.
It's going to be a long winter.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
You just haven't been looking.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I'm just leaving.
Nice.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
Ask me a question.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
After six.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Jean? What?
Why?
Just...say...no!
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Paul Owen.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Does he do this all the time?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Oh no, I'm okay.
I know. I'm sorry.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
No, he just hung out there.
We were both seven in 1969.
Actually, yes.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Don.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Not in the mood, I guess.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
No, Owen.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
...But?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
Isn't that -- extreme?
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Nothing?
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
That'll be a test, won't it?
He wasn't acting?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
What'd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Well -- you sent for me.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Just do what I'm asking!
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Gary?
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Got out of my other commitment.
The Day Care?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Please don't go.
Bring it to the other location.
I could get it out of him.
You're not listening.
Where is he?
You may.
To my health.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
We know all that, Exposition.
Yes?
Carnies.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Thanks.
Groovy!
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
I'm sorry?
A Chigro?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I'm sorry.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Show me.
Great.
You didn't...
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Secret ...
Peter ...
There, look!
Ropes?
After the cold war ...
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
So am I.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I'll never marry you.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Whereas you are.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
No trouble.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Not quite.
Surveillance? By whom?
... and now?
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Perish the thought.
Did I? My mistake.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Check out the other guy's buns.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
You're kidding.
Women!
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What is this person's story here?
I love that car.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Thank you, sir.
But how can I do that?
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Why don't you get undressed.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Let's get naked.
Quiet, Mother.
Let's see your bread.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Gary, you're quite an animal.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
What do you mean, it changes?
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Of course.
Then it's on to the real thing.
Who?
My Debbie?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Not likely.
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
In the Field Museum once.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Hey.
Roll the hose.
Just leave me alone, okay?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Fuck you.
So hello.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
-- What were they doing there?
Shut up!
You look great.
Really? No kidding.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Then why did you quit?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I need another one, sir.
But the right guess on this is arson.
Yeah.
You look like... Brian.
Four months.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Nice boat.
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Coffee sucked.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
I treated you better.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Didn't think you'd make it.
And the world -- the whole world.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
You don't know... nobody knows...
Alderman.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Yeah.
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Yes.
Yes.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Yes, Sister?
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
Yeah!
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
You're in this up till ya neck.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
EUREKA!!
You're now Mantan.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I'm telling you it's not.
I'm wid it.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
We think so.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Pleased to meet you.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So what's up with you?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
How so?
Please don't go there.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
You sound like the media.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Regardless, he still is your father.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
What's a Negro.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Thank you.  And always smile.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
To come back to our roots.
The one with da big...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
You don't read, do you?
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
How do you do, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
I have heard of them.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have faced that problem before.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
It is my only object.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Yes!
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
May I be quite frank with you?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Tender Hegenheim.
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Fine.
HEY!
We don't know. West is dead.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
There were six of us...
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Sir, yes, sir!
Do I?
If not you, then who?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
But not the only victim, right?
My heart weeps.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
You're drunk --
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Not for long.
You're crazy --
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
What?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
Little bit.
So did I.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
Want company?
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
He whispered it in my ear.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Childs.
I used it to start the fire --
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Well, she... uh...
I know.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
I never knew.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
You don't like it?
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
I'm not scared.
You learned from the best.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
Okay.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
I think someone hasn't.
It would kill you, huh?
Okay. Okay.
Story of my life.
Yes. Exactly.
How did you get so many?
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
Is he going to be okay?
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
You know what for.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
We'll stop then.
Yeah.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Right.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
Right.
No, no...
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
Good night.
He wants money.
He wants the money from your bank.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
She's alive?
Nobody's that unhappy.
What's your name?
Please.
Maybe you will find out.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Cash.
I need to uh...
Oh, she older than that.
I need ya help again.
For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
I'll take a jar of that, too.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
How long... how long I been out?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
What do you want?
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Nothin'.
By myself?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
I know that.
Shit. Who hasn't?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
I told you to TURN BACK!
One thing at a time, Laz.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I do.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Ronnie...
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
The hell you call me?
Why?
Who do you think the Jap is?
Not a prayer.
You said that in the last two places.
Maybe we should bail?
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
I want to go talk to him.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Kampai.
A wife.  She left.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
How can you be so sure?
There was a change in plans.
And I'm supposed to care?
He's got a reason.
Why would you care?
This by this...
What?
Why me?
If he won't cooperate?
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
You're just all so... so different.
Of course not.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
No.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Where do we start?
How do I stop one?
The umbrella.
I like you too.
No.  I got a problem.
Meaning?
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
I don't know nothing about it.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
Why should I be?
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I'm sorry.
Me and my dad.
How are you doing?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
No, I don't.
What difference will it make?
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Thirteen.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Yes?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
My office.
Yes, ma'am.
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Nope.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Yes.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
Oh, I could die...
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Sure.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
I guess we'll need another locker.
Name it.
I didn't know that.
Two weeks.
Never drive again!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Good-bye!
Not that one!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Yes, sir.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Your mom made that all by herself.
I promise. Is that all?
Uh, I think they have.
You nut!
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Just look!!
Gladly.
Say what?!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
A psychiatrist?!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
How could you?! This is just like home!
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Would you excuse me?
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Mutants?!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
--and we will--
I forgot some of my stuff.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Those sluts!
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
And if we can't find him?
I don't know. I like to think so.
To get some frozen poultry.
Stop!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
The criminals are winning.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
No, not at all.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
No. What is happening?
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
OK.
Same here.
Hello.
Yes. Frank--
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No police!!!  No police!!
Do you love me?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
What?
Oh he forced you, huh?
My bourbon.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
This is it.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Am I bothering you?
What else is new? Right?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
He got a little jealous.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
That's what I thought.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
I'm really sorry.
Shoot.
Jeffrey? Why?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Look under the body.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
What?  What, that guy?
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Well, I didn't but...
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
We paid attention in school.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Be careful.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Okay. We're ready.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Uh... two shooters!
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Eight.
No way they could have seen it.
I...
No. You sure you're okay?
Roc. You okay?
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Yeah boss?
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Yeah.
Nothing. Go ahead.
Dignan! Stop!
We got it. We got it.
Why not?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
I'll say it.
What. What's the matter?
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
That's not correct.
Where's the rest?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Bob!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I don't think you will.
So do I.
Hang on a second.
OK. Roger.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I'll see you there.
He did?
Nothing.
Behind Bob's house.
Dignan, I --
What?
Take a deep breath.
That sounds like Dignan.
Me?
I don't want to die.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
See you, Bob.
What was that?
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Cuba.
Like silk?
I hear you're a good thief.
Feel this.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Wait a second.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
I don't know about that.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
No. I was calm.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
They said he's a drug dealer.
That could be anybody's.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I can't do that, Bob.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Let's go!
26 weeks.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Yes.
Who? Applejack?
Well, I left some money in there.
Sure.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Nice to meet you.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
One last push. One.
What do you mean?
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Excuse me.
Don't you want answers?
Thanks.
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Okay.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Sorry. Old habits.
I don't know.
What's going on in Berlin?
-- what? --
He was at the campground yesterday.
We can't wait to be sure.
-- hang on --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Who is Pamela Landy?
My first job.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
By who?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
It is suicide.
I have ordered conscriptions...
The Scots will fight for us?
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace's followers.
I don't want to be a martyr.
It's up to us, Hamish!
That depends on the man.
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
Thank you for inviting.
Nor I!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
And I with you. But you must wake.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
What?
Can't he come out for one day?
Okay.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
How long will I be in here?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Hi, Lenny.
So how's Tommy?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Those are your clothes, silly.
I dunno.  Just being weird.
So it didn't feel... weird?
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
Because you're... different.
Which is?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Me neither.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He always has.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Come up here a minute.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Occupied France?
And the other alternative?
Not an easy day to forget.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I will.
Uh huh.
I didn't count the days.
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Please.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
I don't understand. What about you?
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
No, Victor, no.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
I love you very much, my dear.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
I beg your pardon?
But we made a deal.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
I slept very well.
May we proceed with the business?
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
And that is?
Even in Berlin.
Good evening, Captain.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
Put that phone down!
Yeah?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
No. Not me, boss.
Yes, boss.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too much, I'll die.
Do too little you'll die.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Well, not really, I --
No.  that was the last one.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Not if you work for FedEx.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I can't even keep fish alive.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
I can't take him to work.
Yes there is.
What was inside?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
No.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Mom, meet Jango.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
That's why you're a gambling man.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
To life.
I need to do it.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
No sweat.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
I'm *not* a doctor!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I know.
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
Burma!
At least you were never lonely.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Sure. Thanks.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Someone not from Maine.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
It's okay--I don't mind.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
In other words, scurvy.
Nobody's named this one yet.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Almost.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
That's not a bad place to start.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
She walked.
Today? Started off great...
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Come on...
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
I think two million.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
No thanks. I'm good.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Good boy.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Great. Thank you.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Why?
It's what I do. It's my job.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
No, I want my cut!
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Where the hell is she?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
So what do you want?
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
My car's in the garage.
I can imagine.
I despise the job.
A couple I know are getting married.
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
What?!
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I want a job, Giles.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
Who was he?
Not particularly.
Not entirely.
You mean I won't resist them.
You want me drunk?
I won't be that long.
Turn around.
I've got a job.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Probably.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
What about a drink on the way home?
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Marion. It's a book.
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
Gambling's not about money.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Nothing about you.
It's not that.
Yes, I know that.
You know where I'm from?
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
Impossible to calculate.
First visit to London?
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Just an accident. Nothing.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Yes.
Who did it? Tell me!
Have I?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Thanks.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Jack.
No.
Why four? And not three or five?
Any exceptions?
They've been tested.
You won't. Not without permission.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Yes.
Fine.
Does he win?
I can see.
Right, that checks out here.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Armed.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Exactly.
Of course not.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Any of 'em any good?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Wha?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Doolittle, hello?
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Yeah.
How I make my living, what's your point?
What're you talkin' about?
How come I never hearda you before?
What the hell are you doing?
Leave.  Now.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
Am I?
Yech...
Every week.
Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Whoever that is.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Too early to tell.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
It was open.
How do I know you didn't?
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How well do you remember the lab?
Your basic hodge-podge.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
I'm sorry.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Straight.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
They're prisoners to their genes.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
I actually know how this works.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
I'm the victim here.
Exactly.
Does this person have a name?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Bye.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Weird...
We are not stealing my mom's car.
DUDES!
The easy way.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Theoretically.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
I'm telling Mom.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Will you go with me?
I'm going home.
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Maybe she's asleep.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
It's safe here.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Have you ever made love, Donald?
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Why?
Who is he going to kill?
Why would I tell Mom?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
You can suck a fuck.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
I stole four beers from my dad.
She's alive, sweetie.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
We was robbed.
I just did.
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
That's right.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
What?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Gladys! Stop it!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Uh, Gladys?
This is -- what?
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
Who to?
"My President"...
You do and I'll fire you.
Take a letter...
Yes -- why?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Yankee Poodle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
Did you shoot the rapids?
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
And Vera niece, too.
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You worm!
THEN IT'S WAR!
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
How lovely.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
I don't understand.
Please do.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
You're English.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The main spire.
John Merrick.
Say "Merrick".
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
A dressing bag.
Yes. John wants it.
HE'S GONE!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
Ah! It's my father!
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
But surely you know...?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
And the week before that?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Of course.
I will go and wake them up!
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
What about the raping?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Ah.
Aaagh! Rape!
Why?
Find it... AND cross it!
He was lucky...  Sit there.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Who have you been talking to?
That's my boy!
You may need a real Berserk.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
You'll be sucked down too!
Nobody gets killed.
What are you talking about?
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
You will wait?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
You could charge him what you like.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Relax!
You'll drown us bo...
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Easy, Dad!
You liar!
And something to sharpen them with?
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I did. You said, things were fine.
Why what?
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Okay.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
I don't want to take you out of your way.
It's okay.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I'm fine.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No. I --
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I think so.
Okay.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
No, it isn't that.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
Really? Is he cute?
It's very late.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I don't know.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I probably got the same thing as you.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
You must have been crazy.
I'm like a joke to them.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Go back to sleep.
I'm sorry.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Sorry. I just --
'kay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's a good one all right.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yeah.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Hi.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Welcome, Howard.
Well, thank you, Mary.
Is that Nietzsche?
Alexander Pope?
That's fine, Stan.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
You can if you want.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
Justin?
Coop, where are you...
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What?
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What's on your mind?
From the Other Place...
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Justin.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Peters...
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
Son of a bitch!
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
I just finished drying...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Ship's log.
I'm sorry.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
It's easy for you to be patient.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
This makes five.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben! Ben!
Ben, are you there?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
They're not costumes.
But all these people...
I think that thing is Ben.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
Sue... look at your hands.
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Of course. Of course.
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
You can't leave them out there.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
How much did they cost?
On the ledge?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
They were left over from the last shift.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
I know it's yours.
All right, I take it back.
Get going.
No. It's too soon.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Damone. It's Mark.
Chicken!
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Fine. Get lost.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Yes.
I like sex.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Climax together.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
No.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
That little prick.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yes.
Where do you feel like going?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Excellent.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Anything to drink?
Yes... It makes sense.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Tell me. What do you want?
Dobermans don't talk.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Not down in my parts.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
This is my granddaughter...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
You whore!
Lacerda?
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
They were all veterans.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Me?
That's a strange attitude.
We can't risk letting them in.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Where is everyone?
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
OPEN THE DOOR!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Shit!
Look.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Will I go crazy or something?
Okay then.
How much you got?
Good.
How many?
Seven.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
You smell like ass!
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Gimme the keys.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Nothing, just lookin'.
And the last one is the...
That's fine.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Well...
I said I'm not lying.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
You're afraid!
Frances.
Right now we have to be practical.
You're under arrest.
Without me.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
No. Never.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
...Then go.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
But, Kurt, I...
I wouldn't miss it.
What is this?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What?
Kaminski.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Frances...
That's right.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Yeah. I don't know.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Who's writing this guy's lines?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
Then why did you bring them?
What's wrong?
Sure.
Mama...?
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I'm going out!
Oh bullshit.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Please sit down...
I see.
Stay calm, please.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
What?
I was watching.
Then why weep for him?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Her body pleases me.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
I wish to be your wife.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
So do I.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
It is
Now husband and wife.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Can you think of a better reason?
They'll hang him all the same.
I resent God's monopoly.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Is that your diagnosis?
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
The strain was evident.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
Artist.
I don't know.
Almost five.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Okay.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I meant everything.
Where's Ned?
I don't believe you...
I love you.
I guess...
Umhummmmph.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Aw.
How much do I owe you?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
So let's do it.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Jacob.
He's my son.
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Yes.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
In the Winnebago.
In other words, no.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Kate, Scott?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
That happens, you'll get it back.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Everybody goes home!
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Okay.
Not even for lunch?
Knock yourself out.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
He didn't recognize shit.
Sight seein'.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
What?
No, I didn't.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
I'm here with you.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Yeah, it's mine.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
Of course, but there's more --
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Straight up?
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Just like you would be.
So dump on me.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Which is guy-speak for...
They had to kill 'em?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
Sure, sure.
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Should I be afraid?
That's not right.
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Your new roommate.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
The first female President?
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Great. See ya then.
Where's Audrey?
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Oh yes he will.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
Who is he?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
What?
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Good idea.
"The show must go on."
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Yes but, we were wondering-
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
GO Commander.
Up.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Right.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Why does this sound so familiar?
Gwen...
Mark 12.
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
Wh... Where are we?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Is that a fact.
Same old story.
That can't be.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Well... I misunderstood, then.
No.  I guess.
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
Yes, I believe so.
Who's in command out there?
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Lafayette is a child!
They are... friends of Congress.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Gag on your own invention, then.
You invented this, this...
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
How can you say that?
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
General Lee, sir!
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else?  From Virginia?
To win this war I need an army.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
It is; we need you George.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
You're out of your mind!
They can use their imaginations.
I reserved a Cadillac.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
I guess still in the locker.
Who?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
You gave him the money?
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
That's all.
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Really? You ever been arrested?
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
What's it called?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
He drown?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Just a thought.
Read it. It's a grabber.
His shrink's trainer.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
Ask your man here.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
We talk different?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
They report it to the IRS.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
How much is the wife offered?
Rough day on the set?
Man, can you scream.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
There a part in it for you?
Sounds fair.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
Really.
You thought I was faking?
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Be quiet and listen.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Shylock?
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Sixty pounds.
No.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Right. Wednesday.
Threw a turbine blade.
How long to fix?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Could be meant as a warning.
If they knew what they were carrying.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You smashed it!
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Then you're a lucky man.
There's a charming thought.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
That's what I call a payday.
You're a pal.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
So what did happen?
You're more practical than superstitious.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
Wish I could say the same.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Showing you what?
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Over the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
What's this?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
What is it now?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Huh?
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Hi.
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
How long have you been up?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
How perfect.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
Wait...
Where did you get that?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
He gives me a total boner!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Go ahead...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You're insane.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
What happened to Seymour?
So should I come over?
What are you talking about? Who?
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Shhh!
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
That's okay...
I know it's over, asshole, I --
You don't know what you're talking about.
I did too!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Oh, right...
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
OH MY GOD!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
Jesus, Seymour.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Are you okay?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
What? You're kidding me...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
And you like them?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
No problem.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
Right, exactly!
Maybe she's with Josh?
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
I assure you we came close many times-
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Does he speak English?
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
We need to talk.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
That's very considerate.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
Thank you, Samuel.
I do, actually; very much.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Underneath.  Somewhere.
They will want a lot of money.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
I'd rather not.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Oh no.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Hi, Egon.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
I know.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
You need the exercise.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
I'll get one more reading.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
Wonder what?
What's the matter, dear?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Can't you tell me now?
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
We'll get back to you.
Print is dead.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Why not?
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Well, that ought to do it.
Look!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Me, too.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Right.  We'll believe anything.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
You flatter me, Caesar.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
I don't know...
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Only from a distance.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Would that Marcus had lived.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Well, we can try...
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Well, they die for it!
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
No.
Wait a minute.
With a family?
No.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You do?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
No.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
All right then! Yes!
Did you say rape her?
What did she say?
Because it isn't true.
My belt.
I don't see how we can.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Carl who?
Oh no. He said that.
Not exactly.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
I am going to call the police now.
Get out!
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
A room. I'd like a room, please.
What? No. Nothing.
No.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I'm very neurotic.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Sit down.
Yes.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Come on.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Thank you for taking me home.
I haven't. No.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Now?
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Yes.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Why don't you watch?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Okay.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Are you afraid of me?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
About five years.
No.
See if you can guess.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Why are you asking me all this?
Kind of.
We'd go to his car.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
I was just kidding around.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
What?
Of course you did.
If that's how you feel --
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
May I stay then?
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Do exactly what I say.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Very good, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
I am not threatening you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
You miss the point.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Dad -- can you listen --
I don't believe it.
Splendid!
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
No --
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Oh -- work!!
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
I'll do anything for you.
Would you like to make a man happy?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Yes --
And...?
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Just for a minute then.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
What is the matter?
Oh -- 
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Yes.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Till then.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Ready, Baron.
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I must have made a mistake.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Be quiet.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
No, doctor.
Oh!
Oh -- but -- I --
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Preysing?
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
No -- now.
Yes.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Well, he's a gentleman!
Shhh -- here he is now.
Yes --
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
What a session this has been.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh -- but it can't be.
I don't know you.
Yes, the police must be called.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
No news yet?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Bobo, no, I --
My son was in the hospital --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You expect me to buy this?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
You brought a case? Good.
What? He's going to be all right!
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
What is?
But they must be! They cut glass!
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
It's not your fault.
Perk, remember?
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
They twisted my arm.
Sure.
Bluebell came in?
You don't have the stomach for it.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
You, too, Roy.
This way's perfect.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
What?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
A future. The only future I've got.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I can't. I just left home.
No more than this?
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I want to know everything about you.
Every day in every way.
Working the what?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Yeah? How?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
I went out to Delmar.
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
That's natural.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Not many.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
I like a woman who takes control.
The cemetery...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
No shit.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
I was trying to get away from someone.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
The serial killer?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
What is it?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Shit, Linda!
Why?  You interested?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
You stay away from him!
Here.  Let me try.
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
Halloween.
Wait a minute ...
Or what's left of him.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
The hell with the diamonds!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
So long, Colonel.
Huh.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
You never played a violin.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If what?
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Is Penelope in?
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Is anybody besides you here now?
Man and boy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Where did you get the poison?
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
You're wrong.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
What then?
And he keeps it in his apartment?
What are you going to do?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I came for Paul as well.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
What a handsome word.
No.
I mean it!
Ooops.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
She's fine.  Please--
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You've been bitten by bats?
Would you say that again?
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
You're old--so old.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
What are you going to do?
She did?
How horrible.
Yes.
That is sad.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
No.
Father's friend.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
You're going out?
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
That's something I suppose.
I'm glad.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
Good night.
Yeah.
Far as I know.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
A what?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
I believe in miracles now.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Or get eaten alive.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
He died of a massive rupture.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Do you want to take a session?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You want a tip?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Just one.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Um-hm. Live sound.
No. I saw her with Tod.
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
Huh?
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
What rate?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
They are the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Yeah.
What are you paying me for?
Where is she?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
They're legal now.
The police? They know less than you do.
Get out.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Who is Ratan?
What is going on?
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know nothing, man.
What do you think of that? Or this?
I'm worried about Jake.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You working in San Diego now?
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Where are the papers?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
It's very interesting.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
But what?
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
I don't know.
Yes.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
I like you, Maude.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Well, they're my species.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
For you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
To a girl. Here.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
No.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
The moment of truth.
Eh?
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Oh, I do. I do.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
I've got to finish it.
Finish what?
And what about you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
We don't take hints.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
What is it?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I worry about you.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Did he, now?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
I'm in charge. We go back!
Myers?
Yes?
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Hostage negotiations.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Out? Out out?
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Two steps back, please.
Want to buy a bed?
It'll go in.
It's just a puzzle box.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
Many times.
Stay the fuck away from me.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Come to Daddy.
Oh.
I don't want to see the dress.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Keep your voice down.
Later.
What?
Not know.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
No. I'm not.
In here.
Are you O.K.?
Can I get you anything?
O.K.
What are you talking about?
You want something to drink?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Maybe I will.
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
YOU'D like my room.
I've forgotten.
Never better. You sleep well.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right.  No. That's nice.
I see.
Your father told me you were working here.
You gotta be kidding me.
What's next?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Fuck off, Barry.
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
It's the new --
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Uh.  That's me.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
I want a tape.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Maybe I should talk to him.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Yeah.
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
But don't you remember?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I think you know that.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Never?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
It's me.
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Those aren't mine.
Pigsty.
Do you want me to be there?
Uh... No.
What?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
But what?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Hi.  What are you doing?
Where?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Barry said its done.
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
So?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Thank you.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Whiskey.
Good.
That way.  You?
I'll call you.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Fine.
Sure.  Ten cents.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
You're the expert.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Does Carl Smith?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
You're wrong.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
You are.  Now.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Follow me.
You won't.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Just a little crazy.
I'd like you to try.
You killed those other two.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
What is it you want?
I'm just curious.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I want Taupin.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
You always were hard to impress.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
But you lived.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
You know me home.  Me name.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Again.  Try again.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Kiss me.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
So sure?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
We have no understanding.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Either you are with me or against me.
Must he go?
Thanks.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
What name is he using?
He knows I'm here.  How?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
What are you doing here?
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
And if I refuse?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Home.
His only kid.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
What?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Out some place.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Then who are you?

Where are we going?
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I see what you mean.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, I'm independent, too.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
No, you don't!
Do you want to get us scooped?
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
What home?
No, I can't.
You bet I've got a better offer.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You -- you --
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Thanks...
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
We're not interested.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You're not fooling anybody.
It'll be Heaven!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
I always have both.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
All right -- all right!
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Good coffee, isn't it?
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
I won't.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
All right, Judge.
I'll go right after it.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
That man there!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Don't move!
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Ssh!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Huh?
A very fine-looking women.
She and Mollie were talking.
Do you know any swear words?
OK. You're in.
You couldn't.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
A bit too quick.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
You need trees for an avenue.
And absent bridegrooms!
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Where to?
Fair enough.  The river.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Or what?
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
What about R.J.?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Well, yeah, kind of.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Really fucking awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Yeah, showtime for what?
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
It won't work.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
That's nice.
He should be back in a couple hours.
How's he get around out here?
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
You got to be fucking joking.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I was just kidding.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
Where we headed?
Shit... fuck procedure.
Aw, fuck.
I guess not.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Right...  ...come on.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
Hmmmph.
Not in front of the boy.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
No. You look so beautiful.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Shan't happen again.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Loves animals. Loves you.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
My brother says he likes you, too.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Be still my crotch.
With pleasure.
Shut up, you.
Where?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Yes, darling.
I don't know. Something.
He looks perfectly fine.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
It would just be helpful to know.
That's great.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Even better.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yes?
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
It's open...  What'll you have?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Well, nobody has to sell.
Thank you.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Deal the cards.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Thought you only drank milk.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Thanks for the drink.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Sign up.
I been thinking.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Over there by the bar.
You hustlin' me?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Give me a drink, will ya?
I told you you'd get your money back.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Gimme ten bucks.
Heads.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
What bus?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
No, not always.
I'm not.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
You told me.
Okay. So what's your name today?
What's this supposed to mean?
No. You?
What's it so hot in here for?
He knows. A lot.
Well, what else does?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Just for luck.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Is that a fact?
California. Oakland.
Yeah. That's right, too.
That's what the game's all about.
You name it.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
Where you lived with them.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
What's inside?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Please.
That's fine.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
Better now, son?
George, you're acting very strangely.
Good night.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
What happened to your other slipper?
What?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
All right.  I'll be right back.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
I'll bet.
So sue me.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
What'd I say?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Then God help us.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Then find them.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
It had been deemed classified.
Dick-weed.
Really? Ballet?
Oh. Sorry.
We're already over Mach 2!
It's all fuzzy.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
Deploy.
I said call them back.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
You are on your own?
You've got it!
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
I'm going after Dad.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
How dare he?!
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
What were they looking for?
Don't know. Think of something.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
If only I could have been with you.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Will you take it easy!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
She talks in her sleep.
And the chair.
Head for the fireplace!
...the solution presents itself.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Ships that pass in the night...
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
The penitent man. The penitent...
"J".
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Junior?! Dad...
Ready.
That was seven hundred years ago.
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
I don't need camels.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
I don't like to show off.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
No.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Their children?
A snake!
It's pulling me deeper!
Can you move your arm?
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
You've got to go to sleep now.
No... they won't kill me.
Not quite.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
Willie, come on!
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm...inside you.
This candid camera?
What is your name?
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah...Who?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
You're not crazy.
I'll tell you what to say.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I'm not leaving until you do.
I'll sue.
Take a left and your next right.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
You'll be me.
Why not?
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
Try another language.
Wait.
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Is something glinting?
Not blue enough.
It is my business. It's my name.
You have no taste.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You got any books in there?
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Follow her.
On what?
I can't keep up.
...imagine a better grape for the region.
I can't see a thing.
You were with GRUNER!
Not sure at all.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
That's nice.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Don't worry.
Me.
**?!! 
Yes. Joe.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
How do I look?
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
What?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Not...complaining, actually.
What's what?
Then who did?
I just work for the travel firm.
I am sort of scattered.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
No, he didn't do that.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
You think I'm like that?
I asked him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
What'd...you forget?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Nothing we can do.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Her?
I told you, I work for him.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I know a nice island.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
The experiment. The danger...
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Okay.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Where?
Yes, baby?
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Okay.
Get me Wigand.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Catch ya' later.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Try the car.
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
Let me call you back...
Hello? Yeah...
What?!
I'm alone on this...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
Area code 212-555-0199.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Alright?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Lowell!
I'm with Don on this.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Next to your father?
You mean... since this morning?
What?!
No? No, what?
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
I can't say that!
You called me.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Seven...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
You threatening my family, now, too?
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
-- and we are sure...
Triple!
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
What the hell is Botox?
Set one side for Bel Air.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Thanks, buddy.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
You do?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
May I come in?
Those are gifts.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Marylin?
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Hello Miles.
Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Well -- is that possible?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Miles -- why so angry?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Three is not Farrow.
Who's Rex's guy?
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
We'll go into that some other time.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
I might.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
South America.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Oh, come now
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Oh, nono.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
What would you like to have me do?
Yes, sir.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
No.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
No. I'd rather you didn't.
What are you talking about?
You must have me confused with
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Yes.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
What's got into you?
Thought you were hungry!
Try me.
I hate the horrid stuff.
You think it's simple, huh?
Clever.
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
What for?
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Come here, you little fool!
Left twenty minutes ago.
Thank you.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Well, I'll be
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
A trumpet?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
I can use a smart guy like you.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Yeah, I guess you do.
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
There's a word - orders.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
It leads farther than that.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Who?
Allen Dulles?
Are they?  Why would they?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
The assassination, Jack?
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Splendid, love to see them.
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Do you walk home?
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
I can't believe you do me this way.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
How'd you know where he was?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She wants to go back to work.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
That doesn't sound dark.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Was she helpful?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Uh-huh.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
"American President"
They seem to like the idea.
He was here?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Do you think they bought it?
It's not that simple.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Spain.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
I'm just tired in general.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Was she there?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
Si.
But you didn't do that.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
Great...  ...Wanda!
Dreaming.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
Talk to you tomorrow.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
It's a cockatoo.
That's a good idea.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Designer clothes.
It's a diet thing?
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
Were you a disco girl?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Who's arm is that?
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
And your point is?
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
This one.
That's what I been tellin' you. Start adding these motherfuckin' figures up, and you tell me this ain't a business to be in.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
What did he do?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
That's right.
How am I supposed to know that?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Haven't a clue.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
She's been there since Thursday night.
She was afraid.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
I know where it is.
What isn't happening?
Like Della.
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Me, too.
There's nothing to expose.
What do you mean?
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Hey, wait!
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Why do you say that?
No. Not really ...
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I say you should get a shrink.
How do you know?
I saw Sarah the other day.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
You should go back to her.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Where to?
Who? Jed?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
They're like demons, Jez.
Show me Della!
Here. I'll do it.
Are we in Brooklyn?
I love you, Jez.
How come? The army?
Why didn't you call me?
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Like it was yesterday.
It's strong stuff.
Pleasant dreams.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
I need to see you, Jake.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
I just need to talk.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
I don't know what to do.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
Alright, asshole.
We don't have time to argue!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
What if we don't?
And what happend to ...?
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I get it.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm on my way.
You lost the charge?
He was chasing me!
That ought'a help the situation.
You need to get laid!
You killed him?
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Oh shit! There he is!
Who are you apologizing to?
Oh, alright.
I love you.
Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
I gotta go back.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Are you finished?
You wanna die?
Exactly.
Sure but what good will that do?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Who's driving the boat?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Sure he is.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
What? What?!
Chum?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Why don't we just tow it in?
Be careful, for chrissake.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I can't imagine why.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
He's busy.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
I think I can top that, Mister...
The shaft is giving.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I know.
So that's cool with you, then?
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Viscera?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
No, more commercial stuff.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Come on, I have something for you.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
What's the matter?
I heard that was you.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Your name, please?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
That is sick, man.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
They're yellow.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
It's a loft.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
So you don't do any of those things.
He whips you?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Could I try that?
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Early, you are so sweet.
What'll we do out there?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
I don't know. Wish I did.
...Too bad.
How much do I owe you?
If you say so.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
She wasn't feeling so good.
...Brian hurt his foot.
Shut your mouth.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
Now you gotta be careful.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
What do you mean?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah me too nigga.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Darcy?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Right.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
I had a female vagina last night.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hold on.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Nothing?
Do you care about me?
No, Fidget, I...
Why?
Come dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
I'm sorry.
But I only had sex with Telly.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Did you bleed?
No, I didn't bleed.
Passion...
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Not too late.
Nah.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
I wouldn't know.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
What was your relationship with her?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
What do you mean, stand out?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Did you know her?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Not really.
Then call them!
You like to brag, don't you?
The police haven't told you?
The game's over.  You lost.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
No!  Wait!!
He already did once.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Thanks, David.
Who's Kathy?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Meaning?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
What did he mean by Huxley?
Ten days ago.
Through a rental agency.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Maybe I already have.
Are we going to go through this again?
About what?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
No.  I don't.
Sounds very violent.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
No.
Then show me who you are.
You've got to face the things you feel.
Call room service.
Then why are you backing up?
Exactly.  It's the key.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
Right.  Here!  c-4.
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Because I know what it says.
It could be anything.
Where is the Fortress?
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I won't leave you here.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Never.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
You're coming with us.
We must enter the swamp.
You have done it?
Even by you?
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
I am Quell.
We'll meet you at the inn.
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Hush!
Then look!
I knew.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Many have perished in that maze.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is too late. He has drunk.
I was beautiful then.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Yes.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Well, I don't need them...
How can you say it?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
Now, try a running guy.
OK.
...Because I feel it.
Why?
...Why didn't he close the window?
...Later.
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
...No... he's my lover...
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No... Dino's.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Why am I such an authority?
It's impossible.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
I won't let you die.
You need a ride, Preacher?
That's enough.
I'll kill you!
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Yes -- you are.
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
You can't change your mind.
Pacifica, California.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
You tell stories?
Nine.
Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to it.  From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
You're amazing.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
Where am I?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
Hello.
You were going to get my door.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Yes.
Very clever.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Of course.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
What do you mean?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Can we just ignore it?
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Let's stay for a while.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Where are you staying?
Where have you been staying?
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
I have a 4.0.
I loved him!
I believe we are.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Yes. I was washing my hair.
You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
He chose them already?
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
I know. He has it sent out.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Aside from that.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Projecting joy is not my job.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Oh, my God!!
I don't know --
I do.
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
I guess it'll have to...
So are you!
I completely agree.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Three months.
You're right. Phew!
Faith.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Always.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
To be my bride, of course.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Faerie ring?
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Don't you know?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Aye!  That too.
What know you of fields of war?
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
Fire away!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
Be patient.
I'll go search for it.
Shhh!
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
And I... love you...
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
I don't believe you.
Jest with me then.
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
And as barren of love as stone.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Oh, but I have.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
You've been inside?
What are you doing?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
Sam!
Since seventh grade.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
It's so beautiful.
Red.
You'd better call and cancel.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Uh...using Josh like that.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I'll survive.
Are you his friend?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Is that legal?
Monday.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Hi.
I don't know.
Really?
I'm okay.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so uptight?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
I thought I was helping you.
A sink?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
how much weight have you lost?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Maybe...?
That's too long.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Yes, it is.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Not a shower.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
Why would you be there?
No I'm not!
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
I might have a solution.
Don't.  I don't want it.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
Sun glasses?
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I need you to do me a favor.
I want you to find someone for me.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
Why call me?
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
You're a good mother.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
Who?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
The payoff.
Should I?
We should take a vacation.
What?
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
You could keep it and rent it out?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
In the bedroom.
Better make it a week.
Is Mae Rose okay?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Is Spanky here?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Want me to come back some other time?
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Start your job? What kind of job?
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
That's right, a loan officer.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Oooh...
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Still got that ten dollars?
So you made a generous contribution.
Winston. His name's Winston.
What does that mean?
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
What'd you say?
Say what?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
I said you're soft.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Move it out.
Hey, Ray...
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
Satchmo.
That's a long story...
Blacks welcome there?
Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Uh. No it won't?
I'm calling you out, brother...
You're already there...
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Boogerland!
By she, do you mean he?
No.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
The Dark Prince is here.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
That way.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
You think I'm a tourist?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
What?
What was that?
I think I'm floating.
Yes...
I have to, Valerie.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Yeah. The deep South.
And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Just wondered... what happens?
Well... you can't have them all.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
At Carousel tonight?
Here.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Jessica.
No.
About what?
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
Maybe you'll think of something...
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
They won't listen.
I won't.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
Things change!
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
At least it's over...
What makes you think so?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Listen.
What?
This is our bedroom.
What is?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
What's that, Ed?
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
I don't know.
Okay...
Okay. Thanks.
What's up?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
What's the word on the street?
Who is it?
When he went to work, right.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Tone deaf.
My... My head.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Alice who?
I like to laugh, Fred.
A videotape.
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Why would anyone do something like this?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Pornos?
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Whatiya mean?
Sure. Sure I do.
Come on... get in.
Come on.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Yes.
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Oh, I see.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Is it?
Yes!
I'm thinking.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
I'll say.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Goodness, no!
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Who?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Why, no.
Splendid!
Oh, dear.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Father Perrault is dead.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Uh-huh.
Porters?
Let me go, Bob!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
We'd be eternally grateful if you
Bump?
It's Fenner.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
I guess I lost:
All the time, sir.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Don't worry about it.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
I think that's what's happening...
Get back in the car!
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
What the hell does that mean?
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
Come on now.  People are smart.
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
What if I don't?
Will it lower the curve?
May I have a look?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Fine.  Good.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Where's he making his big speech?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
Someplace safe.
Why?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
She grew up.
Because I found out about her...
About who?
That's comforting.
It's all I could safely move.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
How do I find the --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
I understand.  What's the other thing?
Uh, sir...
Everybody runs.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Go back to work.  All of you.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
She said...
Rufus.  She's a precog.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
They don't belong to anybody.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Sean --
I forgive you...
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Some -- somebody's father?
Who said I would?
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
Yes.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Who?
I forgot my glasses.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
Yes.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Tell me how all this works.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
You're Bobby, right?
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Yes, sir.
Is it a good room?
Is it the good room?
Thank you, sir.
We used to take baths together.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
I love you. Come home.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I feel weird asking him.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
There's no touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Excuse --
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Yeah.
Where is this happening?
Brooklyn.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Where's Ricky.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
I didn't say that.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
No.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
What is it?
You want --
Nah, man...
Where's the drop?
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
So, it was a draw.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I know the number.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
How'd you unlock my phone?
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
I'll get the girl.
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
How much is it?
How much was it?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
What are you doing?
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
They asked who it was.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
He woulda told us right?
You too?
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
No more, man.
So what do we do?
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
What?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Ugh...
Drinks are free, right?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
You strapped?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
No?
That shouldn't be a problem.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Yeah.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Don't worry. I get it.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Who's up for a night on the town.
He had it coming.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Heard where?
Solid, daddy.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
What you talking?
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
Come, sit with us.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Why do you ask?
Just an idle question.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I love you.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do you want me to do?
Betty it's me. It's me.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
So what about him?
What do you want?
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
I have connections.
Give me the address.
I show, you give me the information?
Deal.
[Daniel.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
What do you mean, I'm here?
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I said the plan was right here.
Pinta...
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
I'm looking for potential.
But why not?
It's better to be free, right?
Where?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
No, that was in Columbia.
I don't understand.
I dropped her at home.
That's not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Frank. Frankie.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
You got that right.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
Because...  I was already dead.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
I'm trying, mom.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
You helped him get this job.
That's what friends do.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
What?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
What makes you say that?
I'll call her up.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Who told you that?
I don't think I remember him.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
It pains that they should do this.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
I really should get home...
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Come on inna dining room.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Sure.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
That's the one.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
You not ugly.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What, Ma?
You want a beer, Ang'?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
Okay.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
No.  Or why you should.
Pour one for Painless.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Or her figger.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
I got some.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
When?
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
C-A-M-E-M...?
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
No, no, that one.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Oh, Jesus.
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
You're an attractive man.
But I'm married.
Ayuh.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I didn't have much choice.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
The one and only.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
Your tent?
You mean who hit who?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
I can try, sir.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Yeah?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Yeah, I'm all right.
Um-hum.
Against what?
Who?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
How much money do you get?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
A third party?
All set, Ann?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
You bet I will, Ma.
What letter?
Oh!
There is no letter.
A deal?
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Take it easy, John Doe.
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Baseball?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Shut up!
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
A gag. A gag!
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
That's got nothing to do with it!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
What difference does that make?
She isn't?
That's too bad.
What do you mean, too bad?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Racket? What do you mean?
Out the window! Something just flew by!
SWAT wants to go in.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
You don't want to know.
They want Walter dead!
You're gettin' the car.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
I what?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
For now that's all.
I'll give you something.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
How do you feel after a shooting.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
Recruited you from where?
National Marksman Competition.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Where did you hear that?
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Yes.
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
To run last?
And doing a very good job of it.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Let me show you something, Ray.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
I worship you.
If you did, you never showed it.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
I've been thinking.
Yeah.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
SHIT!
Your concern is heartwarming.
What do you think would be in order?
What happened to your Trans Am?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it?
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
To live forever.
Why --
This is how you pick up women --
No.
Then what?
Unfinished business.
But what if he doesn't --
There is no --
-- Yes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
-- I saw the program.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Some things never change, do they?
Yes.
Try me.
Destination?
-- Waiter.
Yeah, right.
I've never been this sore in my life.
About twenty seconds in your time.
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
But not you.
Life knocked me back.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
What's that divided four ways?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
I can just imagine.
For what?
Gives us something in common.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Like a party for all our friends.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Tommy Reina.
See if these two are my friends.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Didn't know you felt that way.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
Not stupid. Fat.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
The name's Charlie.
I've got friends.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Jesus.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
He called me "Doc."
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
What?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You want to come inside?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
I don't want to talk about it.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I'm sorry.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mother!
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
What happened?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
And where is she?
... Oh ...
You mean it's dangerous?
Never.
Looks like it, but--
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Who?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
That's taking place outside now.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Good idea. When?
Is the wind tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Have *you*?
You know, we're getting married.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
What is it?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
Taylor, my dear.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Yes, Jim.
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Aw--
Ma! Hold him!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Uh--could--could I help--?
What? Who?
Mr. President!
For one week!
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Will he yield for a question?
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Mr. President--
I have no defense against forged papers and--
No, Jeff--please--!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Office of--Senator Smith?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
Most natural thing in the world!
Well--he's got nothing on me.
Convene?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
You *couldn't*?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Why?
I did--and--and I got right up.
It *is* not!
You--don't know it, do you?
Yeah. This land to be bought by contributions from the boys. You have that. Money to be--
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Wow!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Hurray!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Wonderful!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Then you *did* say it.
Goodnight, Senator--
And how's your bill, Senator?
How's that, buddy?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Susan!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Why don't you do it yourself?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Some people like it.
Certainly.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Now, what do you see?
What did he play?
A girl?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Mary - I - excuse me
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
With pay!
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Me, sir?
Oh, yes sir.
I wanna see that guy!
Proceed.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
All set.
Why, no.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
You're going to New York with us.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Yes. That is to say
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Shut up!
They can have the Estate.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Me?!
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
A child? My uncle's?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
I write poetry.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Yes, sir.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Excuse me. What did you say?
I did what!
One hundred books?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Were you supposed to have a session?
I'm fine.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
You are so mean.
Should I open it now?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Tastes good.
Oh?
Well, come on in.
My patient had to leave early.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Doc.  Ainge...
Where am I supposed to eat?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Got a license?  But no car?
Is she a friend of yours?
Mumford... like the town?
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
That's right, the fake kind.
Why don't you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
What?
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Is something wrong, Sofie?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Um-huh.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Transference.
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Hello.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
No again?
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
I can tell you anything else.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Things got a lot worse.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
See you Thursday... regular time.
I'm honored.
You want my advice? Far out!
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Wow.
Well, okay then.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Why do you like to fight so much?
Intestines.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
Twenty.
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Are you sure?
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
How?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Why would I do that?
It's everybody's problem!
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
I was mistaken.
I'm your sister.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I knew you'd know.
What --?
It must have slipped my mind.
Head hunting.
I'm his daughter.
I'm the Bowler.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
What about Captain Amazing?
Why not?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
You don't seem very angry right now.
Monica!
Now you're talking.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
Good point.
SO WHAT?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Well they've crawled back out.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Hey... he's gone.
We're superheroes.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
It is?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
But how do we get in?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Great timing!
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
I'm not insulted.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
It is a terrible shock.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
Does your mother know you have come?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
I will never forgive you.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Go away -- I'm busy.
I know what you're doing in there.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
You couldn't face telling me what?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Show him in.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Don't move me.
What happen?
Naw, I already ate.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
What you mean, so?
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't know yet.
Me too.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
My brothers won't give me a ride.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I saw it.
Excuse me?
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
Let it go!
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Rancho Cucamonga?
What?
Huh?
Good, let's get out.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?
I threw my back, again.
Business.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
That's right.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
You wouldn't...
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No.
Forget about it.
How did you see us kiss?
Nods.
No. Kisses to you.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
Who?
What!?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Could I see it?
It goes in that little hole.
You're a big girl, huh?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Come with me, honey.
Only you.
No.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
About what!
A man of the Cloth?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
The devil wins sometimes!
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Mm-hm.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
All right.
No. No one never did.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
I'm through, Harry.
Them kids is yours?
What are you after them for?
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
The man! The man!
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Jesus.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
She lived there.
Right home after. See you.
Warm milk. Gross.
Great
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
What was it like?
A dress you wear in the evening.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Just for the honeymoon.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
May I ask how much your rooms are?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
No, no.
Brave... that's right.
Just looking around.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
Well, we're back home.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
What can I do about it?
Confess what?
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Yes!
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Your type will soon be extinct.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Please don't misunderstand me...
Then you don't want me to go there.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Thank you. Thank you.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
The telephone is ringing.
Oh, let it ring.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
What are you after?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I have never heard one.
I wish they had never met.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
Anything, Ninotchka.
I promise... I swear.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
How do you do?
Months, Swana.
Has done what?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes, it does.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
How do you do, my friend.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I understand that, sir.
Yes ... I got the money.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Lincoln used it.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
You never told him?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
What about the documents he promised?
Sir ... six bodies.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I expect more from thee, Richard.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
My friends call me "Mister President."
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Winning?
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
What do you mean, Jack?
I beg your pardon --
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
Jesus Christ!
Syracuse.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Maybe I am.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
That's right.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Sir?
Fire him.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
It's over, Dick.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
I don't want them to love me.
Anything.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
When?
You.  What' you're doing --
Hiding what?
Thank you.
Don't be ridiculous!
They were for me.  They're mine.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
When did he die?
Nineteen zero and nine.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
I'm... discouraged.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
He can take all comers.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
The old boy shot by the highway?
That's possible.
Gun out and up.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes Sheriff.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Don't hurt no one.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Hey.
What should I do?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
You expect him?
Step out of the car please, sir.
Screwgie.
Not a bleep.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I don't need to talk to you.
You know she won't be there.
Sixty-nine cent.
What way would that be?
I was just passin' the time.
You already asked me that.
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
No.
Sir?
Uh-huh.
What room?
Yessir. I understand that.
That's not an answer.
Another additional.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I'm retired.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I don't mean braze.
What product.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Yes sir. Two tours.
...I meant your food.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
What about it?
Great. Good. Content...
You must be joking.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Maroon.  I stole it.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I came for love...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Sure I loved it! It was great.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Like Rome?
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
You're hurting him!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
I came for love. My fianc is here.
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
...okay.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
You should have a little faith in people.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
No...
What 'look'?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
...that's a good motto.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
I said 'got it?'
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, five years, give or take.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
"Injuns?"
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Oh fuck...
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Mr. Campbell?
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
Oh my God!
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Helluva awgazation.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Yes, sir.
What for?
Thank you, sir!
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Great ass.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Sid, there's no baby.
One more minute.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
That's it?
Does it still hurt?
What would you do differently?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
So?
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
The fuck did you do that for?!
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
You're an idiot.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
They're coughing.
What about us?
I mean it!
Oh, that phone call...
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Observe.
478...
What?!
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Yeah.
Nope.
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Don't though. 
I'm here.  I'm here.
Close it!
On it!
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Are you finished?
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
You mean...
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
Alone...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Bullshit...
Shut the fuck up!!
Later for that. I'm done either way...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
Late summer.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
Thank you.
As do you.
I know that.
Of course, I do.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Sir?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Are you going to meet with him?
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
You're in no condition to ride.
How old are you?
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Father?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
What?
Cheraw Falls.
Where?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
We saw.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Remember Braddock?
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
I will. Come and kiss me.
For a little while.
To remember.
That's enough, Ellen.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
What's at the end of it?
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Does she love the cat?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
Whose burying ground?
Your cairn.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Yes.
Shit! Look at this mess!
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
You don't understand--
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
Did you see his shirt?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm sure.
She.  Goes.  Free.
You can't.  I can.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Did you, now?
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Commodore, please!
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
That would hardly be proper.
It would appear, so do you.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Exactly.
What's your plan?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
Indeed.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Where did he come from?
A moment.
But --
No.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Do you think she loves him?
No, Icky, this is real.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Poppy, this is not the time!
That's the guy?
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Is that what Argon told you?
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
What about it!
Blame the victim.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
That's going to fit me?
On the counter.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
God, what a fight that was.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
We lost him.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Dexter.
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
For the letters, of course.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
You wear them of course, silly.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Gallagher?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
Your house?
Why
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Oh, is that so?
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Yeah - go on.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
That's so.
A what?
Sure.
No?
Dawson, sir.
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
and those and them.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
I dyed one and washed the other.
Right!
Hello, Stew.
Been where?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
You quit trying to stop anybody
Thanks. May I sit down?
I beg your pardon.
Okay - you remember Joe
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yes, sir.
Me, sir?
No, sir.
I just putter.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
Sure.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Bud brought it to me.
Here's my favorite.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Where are you gonna go?
You want to get out of here?
... Lover's Lane.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Trust me ...
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Well--it was dark out ...
Okay--that's enough!
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
To who?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
They're happy like this.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Nothing?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yes.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What?
Out there.
We'll just put up the top.
I'm not sure.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
Re-runs?
BUD.
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Look ...
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
... Yeah.
Yes.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Yeah ...
Just listen to me ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Aren't you a little early?
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Yeah ...
Cool.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Hello.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
That's your fault not mine.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
Hello everyone.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I don't know.
Yes.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
...yeah.....
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
I need help.
I don't know.
I think that'll be fine.
Thank you.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Alright?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
So that was your pudding?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
What?
Are you learning how to play it?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
...I don't know what you mean....
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
That's right you travel so much.
You left me at the hospital.
So here we go.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Ok.
How?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I didn't do it.
It's ok, take your time.
No one will know your name.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Can you hang on a second?
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Hi.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
Nothing.
You can't be late.
I know.
I know.
What did you say?
Yeah.
No.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
I must grant him his last rites.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Good day, Marquis.
His rug.
-- that was lust --
I know, because I felt it myself --
Why was it you never took her by force?
I'm here.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
His wife's influence.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
And --?
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
No. It most certainly was not.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
HER NAME, ABBE.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
I'll be waiting.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Uh-huh
The actor
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Not for me.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I will not have this in my home.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Yes?
The drinking.
Sir, I-
Please be quiet.
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
I wanna see the picture today
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Can I talk to Hearst?
You are talking to him.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Orson. Stop. Just stop
Sorry to disappoint.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Don't do this
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
What?
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
So they're Jews. . .
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
To do what?
Get out
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Please don't ask me to do this.
Well it' s all you've got !
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It was a -joke, George
I don't want to sit
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
I'm Christ
We're from...
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
About what?
I'm Ok.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
It's not done.
Nothing...
Sure. What is it?
Jack, I got no gloves.
Jack! Enough!
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
You wasn't with her, were you?
You know, like bang her or anything?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Well, that's what I mean.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Yeah.
I never noticed his face.
Positive.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I went to the movies.
What're you talking about?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
Yeah --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
Never felt better.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
You think I made all this up?
All right -- you don't believe me.
Do that.
I was jaywalking.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Give him evidence.
A detective's nightmare.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
You think he's getting out of here?
You figured that out, huh?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I told you that --
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Who said I was getting rid of it?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Gunnison?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
How?
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Lisa Fremont.
Depends one which one.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
You can tell that from here?
Got a shovel?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Uh-huh.
Only because it's expected of her.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Not yet!
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Huh?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Two minutes.
They always live.
Good luck, Buzz.
I'm cute, too.
We got to do something.  Don't we?
You see any cops?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
Say, listen--
Open it.
What's a chickie-run?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Why should you be the only one.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Leave me alone.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
But you don't think that's a solution.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Chicken?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
A what?
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Neither can I.
No.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
See, we're very modern.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
What a relief!
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
That one?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
We were romantic then too--
Why?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Radio said.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, I love you --
JESUS CHRIST!
Canada.
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
We? What "we"...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
No --
Put him in the truck.
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
What's her middle name?
What'd they call her in high school?
Where'd she drop her cherry?
A station wagon in Canada.
What the fuck are you talking about.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Mr. Bangs.
Cancer-sucker.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
Not with you.
How do we do that?
Hell you haven't.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
You gave them me.
That I should've picked you up?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
Sorry, it's my book now.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Don't ask me that.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Your name's Freddy something.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I do.  How do I look?
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
No, I'm not!
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Dead.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
You really think we were set up?
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Well, he knows a little about me.
That fuckin did it!
We don't think this place is safe.
Nobody. The light was bad.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
Maybe it's better that way.
You don't mean that Clay.
Hurry up.
No they won't.
Nice.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Oh... that's the time you went away.
There's only two of them now.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or --  -- go back and watch the horses.
I don't care what she asked you.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
I don't care.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Then why stay in the hills.
Yes, people make me restless.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
Maybe in Sonora.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
And we're running out of that.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
He certainly could. About a month.
Who brought you here?
Stop it --
Then I know my alphabet.
Do I know you?
Never happened!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Okay.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Maybe we can study together or something.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Huh?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Can you feel that?
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Listen to me I --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
It's okay.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
Let me see the files.
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Okay, give me my belt.
I guess so.
Father, come in, please.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Don't worry, I got your back.
Mother? 
You said you hated him.
Always the dentist.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
But, Chip...
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
You mean for TV or print?
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
Don't I get a kiss?
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Yes, I did.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
It's sugarless.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
What's he know?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Sure I do.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Where?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
Which room is it?
Let's get out of here.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Hello, Frances.
But I like teaching school.
I ought to know.
What were you talking about?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Why?
Good.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Who the devil is he?
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Why wait?
Good-bye.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Devil worshippers!
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's not a searchlight  it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince - not stars --
They may have been friends of hers.
It's here, too.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is - when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
That's too bad.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Nine years?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
What?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Well, I wasn't always impotent.
What kind of personal project?
You went out with her?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I'm sorry this came up.
Yes, I do.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
When we're making love?
Does he go down on you?
So you lied to her?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
And you feel the same way with John?
That's very flattering.
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I don't care.
Mmmmm...
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I know.
No, I didn't.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
What upsets you about that?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Yeah, I know.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Did you masturbate?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Radon leakage?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
No, he left last week.
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
What?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
He doesn't have a phone.
But he won't.
And what?
What's wrong with that?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
He wouldn't do that.
Why?
Thirty-two dollars.
Well. I can't stay.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Whichever you prefer.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Different.
I can't talk you into it?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Why?
You're intrigued?
I like the way he dresses.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Who?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
He'll be really mad.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Nick, you're so strange...
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
You got it!
I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Who trusts experts?
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Shove it, Ralph!
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Farley!
F for...
Fabulous!
SIN-I-FUL
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Bye.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Highliner.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
That's what people say.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
What?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Um... seventy... something.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
So you're going to stop acting?
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
And she likes Pinot.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
How do you know?
Shut up.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Right now.
Yep.
What?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
That was three years ago after that first party!
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Let's leave it alone.
I don't have to.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
The plan is... you go.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
How long have you been into wine?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
About two-thirty.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Right.
She doesn't answer me either.
It tastes funny.
Dad!
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Explain noises.
Are you going to do this or what?
Yes, it was.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
We have to go in the basement.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
It's getting stronger.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
I have some upstairs.
I just asked his name.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
I would say so.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
No.
Why not?
What did you say?
It's like War of the Worlds.
What friend is that?
Your next water ain't for three days.
It was my fault.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
That's it.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
I haven't done anything.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
It's a town...
Anybody got any ideas?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
It's none of your business.
Good luck, Mal.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
That's the good stuff.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Of course.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Excuse us.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
"Forever".
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
Do what?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Well, I --
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
There's... a wall between you --
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
Somebody said she was here.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
I love you too, daddy.
I know.  Thank her for me.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
It's a yacht.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Long live the First Amendment.
Thank you.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
You know what I'm talking about.
Dr. Crowe.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
Yes.
No gas... Hey, that's good.
Oh my God.
They scare me too sometimes.
You think I'm a freak?
Got it.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
It's our pleasure.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
...Hi.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Sorry.
Not someone -- Mac.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
I could. You sucked.
Metaphysical question, man.
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Not while you're driving.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Don't look.
Like your guitar break.
And that makes you look like a squid?
I got to leave my post.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Brought you munchies.
How many you need?
You're my princess, aren't you?
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Gold--digger, huh?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Margaret.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Eleven.
Ciao.
Like what?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
That's me.
No.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
Yeah, guy?
Do I have a choice?
Then don't.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
What's that, pardner?
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Where the hell are you?
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
You have a butler working that floor?
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
And threw us into the lake.
Two of 'em?
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
You woulda?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I left him a message.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...So you made another deal?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Right, you got clicks, anything?
It's gettin' done Sid.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
Security's locking down the elevators.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
What else did Padiche say?
Can it work?
You'll end up like me.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Why did you agree to come here?
Whose side are you on?
He'll let me in.
What was it?
To who?
Who are you trying to convince?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
To calm your anxiety.
Yes.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
I did too.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Sartorius.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I'm disgusting.
I never said I didn't.
Then you won't make it.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
I wish you wouldn't.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Occasionally.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Beg pardon?
I got money.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
I'll miss you, Mike...
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Stop being nuts!
What do you want to do?
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I'll think about Wednesday.
Long enough.
And I'm making mine.
Nothing.
My ass is falling.  It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Get in bed.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I watched TV.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
What about Tommy?
No.
Me neither.
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Call a cruiser!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Mom and I got plans.
Shooting?
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
I know.
I'm always here, Pete.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Don't be pitiful.
Lemme down, bugface!
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Huh?
I think I'd like that.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Peter-- my condolences.
See?  You big dullard.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Your dog ate it.
How much do you know about it?
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Like it?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Just drop me off here.
Plenty.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Coming up.
That'll do.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Forget it.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
My legs are frozen.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Maybe they were layin' for 'em out there!
You can say that again!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
You're crying, Animal.
You want to go?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
Anybody cover?
Who did?
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Give this to Joey, will you?
Oh.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
No! No!
How many do you want? A thousand?
Russian women prisoners?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Just don't drool on it.
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
And destroy every planet in the system.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Agreed.
Really? What do you feel?
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
I don't understand.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Phasing? To where?
What do you want?
No. Thank you.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Aye, sir.
What did you see, Chekov?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Spock's burial robe.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Not exactly.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
What's wrong?
Just him, sir!
Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station!
Yes. And I know you.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Welcome home, Jim.
May I ask why...?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
Yes, I was...
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
What must I do?
What I have done, I had to do.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Understood, my lord.
They know we would die first.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
How is that...?
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
Who --
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
What do you want with us? I demand --
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
We encoded four minutes --
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
Visual --
Chekov, who is this man?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Try the emergency channels...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Admiral --
Do it, while we have time.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Not at present.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
The ship -- out of danger?
Or the one.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Very well.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Energize defense fields.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<u>WHAT</u>?
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Distance from Reliant...
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Stop engines.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Come on, Pavel...
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
It is.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
The top of what?
I am? May I go now?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
The hell they did.
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Go ahead.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What do you mean now?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
... Damn!
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
In progress, Admiral.
Yes.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Out of control, and blind as a bat!
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
On my way...!
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
The keyboard... How quaint.
Right on. You fly?
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really?
Do machines ever play?
And our people?
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
The purpose being...?
Commander Riker...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We have to find shelter...
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
What...?
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
I never kissed you with a beard before.
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Yes...
At least four hours.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
I'm your creator now.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I told you, there's no --
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
I have the password right here.
There should be some kind of manual release...
She's a very... determined woman.  Phoenix to control. Mister Lange... let her in.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
<U>Engage.</U>
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
What makes you say that?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Then make it so. Have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Agreed. Options?
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
The charge is murder.
You may need assistance, doctor...
We DO sleep lying down.
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
We were until your torpedoes!
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I beg your pardon?
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
You tell them, Lieutenant.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Anything else you want to tell me?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Energize...
Aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
What peace conference?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Confirmed, Captain!
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Not from us!
Aye, aye, sir.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Why?
Indefinitely.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
You're working late.
Dying?
That was another time.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
On my way.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Why?
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Yes.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
Do you have a moment, sir?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Make it so.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.

Thank you, Commander.
Theories?
What do we know about the population?
Weve got him!

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
A coup d'etat?
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
She's a predator.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
Praetor Shinzon?
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
Yes.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
I won't defend my life to you.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And what of the Enterprise?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
He is what his life has made him!
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Runs in the family.
Yes, Praetor.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I came this far alone ...
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
He's got a gun!!
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
What?
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Pancakes.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
This car runs on gas.
Space?
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
It was yellow.
You better.
You want this ticket?
I was afraid.
It was a mistake.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
I must meet my ship.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Do they talk?!
I understand.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
We can.
Where?
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
I will wave to you.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
You could have killed us both!!
Call the police!!
In the cars, too?!
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
You saw that?
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
That's right.
What kind of things exactly?
Talk to me about costs, here.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
What?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
What clip?  What was it?
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Commissioner Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Define illegal.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
She still loves me.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Black.  Jack.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
You sure?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
You really want that on your head?
No.
That's right, Jan.
You're thinking...?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
What's the bad news?
I'm on my way.
What kind?
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Do you think he singled you out?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
That information's being withheld from the media.
The man knew how to dress.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
Oh.
That's true.
Does one exist?
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Sounds like fun.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
I don't...
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Like the quiche?
You too?
Like what?
Oh. You know.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Well, who represents you back east?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Right.
Right.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
I didn't mention her once today.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
An eight.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
No. Just O.J.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Well, you're doing so well...
He's trying to be an actor.
You asshole.
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Hang on, Voltaire.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Whu?
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
Always, baby.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
Baby, you did fine.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
She was hot.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
She thought you were money.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
We're not messing with you...
No...
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
...Definitely...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
And what is that Bonasera?
Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Like hell I will.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
What percentages for my family?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
When did he call?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
You wanted me to be your son.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
That's for you to find out.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
I'm German-Irish.
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
How will they come at you?
They're waiting to see my father.
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I love you.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Let HER ask.
One of them fingered the old man.
Until the old man tells me different.
Just be patient.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
I don't get it.
Okay.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Say again?
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
I love jazz.
Bird!
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
Copy out from here...
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I've got plans!
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Ha.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Marge-maintenance.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Yes it is.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
No, he should talk to you alone.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Okay.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
Dickie did it.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
To the manner born.
He's having an early night.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
I hope so.
I think we sort of found each other.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Thanks.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
It's okay.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
Or I could come back.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Peter, I... I...
And don't forget. I have the key.
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.
November, I thought.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have!
That's an expensive gun.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
Really?
What did you do?
The moon?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
But this is a porno movie.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Keep it.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
This is gotta be a game, right?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
That's fine.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
A real skunk.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Iris.
No.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a...
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
Yeah.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Yes I am.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Oh?
Your name Sport?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Iris?
Slow.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Things got ya down?
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You want to talk about it?
You know how I feel about what you do.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
Womack ripped it up, right?
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Well...
How'd they get it inside?
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
What?
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Have you got a cigarette?
Oh.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I do.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
Listen to me!  The young man in there...
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
A few.
Vultures...
I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
No, sir.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Exactly.
You can't testify.
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
I taught you that.
What?
Cat.
The customers?  I don't know...
It's about me.
Oh.
Got any money?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Yes?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
I despise it.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
That's up to you.
Take them.
Just a little one.
The little Brenner girl.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Thank you.
Impossible.
What happened?
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
A what?
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I know, Mother.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
And if you don't?
Please.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Goodnight, Lydia.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I said I wonder if you could help me.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Doesn't what make me...?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Look, Mr. Brenner...
He was watching a ball game on television.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Yes.
No.
What did it say?
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
Yes.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
Of birds?
...everything I know.
How long have they been gathering there?
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
And he'll talk?
Yes.
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm not sure, but...
How?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
But can't you give me any idea?
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Where can I find him?
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Gray killed her.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
You've no thought of going there?
It was a woman when we put her in.
A doctor?
No.
But what makes a thought start?
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
A pleasure to torment me?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
Burke them?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
I was talking about you.
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
I don't want to see!
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
Erin. Who?
Shut up.
I know.
Could say that.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
I want you... to bend over.
Just hold on to me.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
It still doesn't mean...
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
Yes -- that is true.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Yes -- of course.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
I'll say goodnight again.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
You still haven't answered my question.
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
I'm not going to marry anybody.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
It won't work.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
I was.
I'm sorry.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
No -- I'm afraid not.
This one could save your life.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
Fine!  Stay here!
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<u>Four</u> to go.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Sam, don't --
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
You better not like him too much.
I'll hitch.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Not funny, Sam!
Lucy.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Okay.
Because I love you...
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Even poor people have T.V.s
You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
You promise?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I don't know who to trust.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
The dogs?
You buy any of this, Blair?
We got morphine, don't we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
Well, get to it.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Well, stick to it.
I'll put this right through your head.
Don't let up, Childs!
I am going after them.
Little over two hours.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Can you think of any other tests?
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
Why?
Calm down and get in your position.
Then we go after him.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
I had an accident.
Where?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
Morlocks --
You know of them?
Kalen... hold on a minute.
It frightens you.
Yes...
Why did they built it?
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Created?
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
We make them see what we wish.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Why would you let me go back?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Trust me...
Sorry... I was distracted.
Well there's something new.
All right, what is it now?
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
I've seen it.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
For God's Sake, David --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I know that --
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
Thank you.
And this is your "work"?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
They've gone to a better place.
I am.  Are you a climber?
Should we be...
Depends on what you're seeing.
It's not my job to believe you.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
[Beat] Thank you.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
What?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Good. How's your mom?
Believe me, I know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
Why would we do that?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
You told me this was how it happened.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
You like it?
Have you always been a waitress?
So you never knew your mother?
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Yes, baby?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
My Lord.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
What for?
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
I'm a robber.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
And what's the mysterious code word?
It's me.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
Yeah!
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Let's get it over with.
Just past Boise City.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
You mean now or before?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Harlan.
Thelma!
What?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
What?
We can change our names.
We can live in a hacienda.
It'd have to be pretty good.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
You're drivin'.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Say you're sorry.
We're fine!  How are you?
Nah.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Yeah, right.
You're kidding? What did they say?
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
And this adversely affects me how...?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
You know, clean the pipes.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
People get hurt that way.
Who?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Stalker, huh?
The sawbones?
Same here again.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
How about -- ?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
What?
Warren!
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
You bet.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Four.
I never said that.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Ah, she's okay.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
I don't watch the new ones.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Where would I have seen your work?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Thanks.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
No, that's really unneces --
I wasn't trying --
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
What are you doing?
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What if I can't?
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
This is about Cuba.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
Ray.
Good.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
She's your sister?
A what?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Not no more.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
We're going for The Stronghold.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Ray. What's your 20?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Yes, ma'am.
I was inverted.
No.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Evan... or Maverick.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Harmless!
What about the plane?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Make what?

It's not suffering anymore.
You're horrible
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
You want to go ballistic?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Were upside down!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Okay, okay.
Yawing right.
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
GET LOST!
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
We did it.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
I've seen this before.
So have I.
Didn't everybody?
I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
Yes sir.
Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Take me to the hotel.
But maybe you can change all that.
I'd advise you to hurry.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
So why am I still alive?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
I am Quaid.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
Hetero.
I'm listening.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Swallow this.
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You tell me.
Yeah.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
You know I do.
Do what?
All right, forget about it.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
Inside what?
Jump!
Just wondering.
The one in the mine!
Some kind of mutation...?
My cannon.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Howdy, Rhonda.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
You got that right.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
You got <u>that</u> right!
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Civil?  I'm civil.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
You bet.
Okay, ten dollars.
Around here?  Why would they?
Let's assume that it is.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Complain to the Bar Commission.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Not at all --
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- a speed manufacturer --
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- Remember?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
I haven't paid you.
I don't need sleep!
Screw you too, Kitty.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
That's right.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
-- What trial?
And its purpose?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
And you b-believe that.
A woman.
Tell me some other things about her.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
What was?
Let's ditch this place and party.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Ever see her with someone else?
What happened to her?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's what I heard.
That's good.
It's late, Sam.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
She must have known someone.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Thanks.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
And what a muffin you have.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
We're on our way, Baby.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
What's going on?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
School?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Yes.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
I'm fine.
Very good.
...tell me about this case.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
When she...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
...and you're going to do that?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
The most respected...
Who told you that?
Mrs...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Why?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
Do you want me to go...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
No.
I can't guarantee that...
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes. Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
And ask me what?
Who are you protecting, then?
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
Yes.
He's not in, Sir.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...now who is that...?
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
Admittance form is wrong.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
You use their witness.
Yeah. I'm awake.
The Hospital...?
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Should I?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
All right - I've seen enough!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Did it do you any good?
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
It's gone now.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I liked him.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
What was it like?
Have you got a pocket compass?
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
Looks like the fishing was good.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
They'll probably move at dawn.
It was nearer than that.
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
How would I know...!
Can I read it?
What?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
Chase...
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Heather, has there been another call?
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
He was just here!
What?
Say how they find their way back home.
Coming for you...
I'm fine.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Really?
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Robert?  I...
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
I can take it.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
What?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Believe what?
Congratulations.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
Me too.
I can't watch this.
Ya know... "It".
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Jesus, you never told them?
You're officer of the watch, George.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Why'd you jump?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Like you'd know what to do with one.
What?  Come on...
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
It hurts too much to care.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Joy, rapture...
You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
Up you go.  Right now.
Yes, I was.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
You black?
She really say she was pregnant?
Why should it?
Club Zanzibar.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
What happened on the charges?
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
I'm sorry.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
What I made you do, mama?
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
That don't seem fair.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
Hell, peanut...
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
We got through two states already.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
What kinda trash talk is that?
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Where?
I'm goin'.
Uh huh.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Yeah?
Love you, too.
So where'd you say you was?
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Santos... It isn't.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
In the head.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
No... But...
Well, she wants to fuck you.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
By who?
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Well?...
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Shut up and drink.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Competence.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
So what's the problem?
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
Evidently.  Coming!
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Do you know he won't expel him?
Excuse me?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
Stop calling me Vernon.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
With Emily?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Well...
Like the lady herself.
Right.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
I've got tenure.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
What's he saying?
The guy on the phone.
But... ?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
You can see the outline of a butt.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Me? Sure. Why?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I heard.
You heard? How?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Inside.
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
What is it, Grady?
Ah, right. The book.
Just kidding.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
I like the noise.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
When can I see her?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
It's a nice table.
Then what? What?!
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
What party?
You don't have to tell me this.
Sure.
You live around here?
Not yet.
I'm not pretty.
Have a seat.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
The girl.
Apartment's okay.
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Yes?
Your daddy will always love you.
You should go home.
It's getting dark. Go home.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
It's all the same.
A diary?
That's right.
It's okay.
Forget it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
You have no feelings for your niece?
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
We have a lot of work to do.
Is this the first one?
Please don't do it again.
That's my answer.
This is garbage!
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
How do you feel about that?
I'm talking about you.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
What about them?
Yeah?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
How about in the morning.
Yeah.
What did you do to them?
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
I've got problems.
Who doesn't?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Where're you?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Hey, you okay?
Wasn't up to me.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
It's trying to communicate.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Who then?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Let's go, guys.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Everything is.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
But then when will we see each other?
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Late, very late.
Tell me once more.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
It was futile. We went all over.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Who's moving?
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
There too...
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Here I am.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
What boat?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Is that possible?
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
No.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's not what he meant.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Who?
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
It made them holy.
I just heard you.
What would you like to talk about.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Who?
He's told you?
Often?
Yes.
What baby?
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Don't you know?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No.
I can't have them any more.
One.
Somebody told her.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?  Mmm?
Why not?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
I breathed!
You can tell me.
I can't.
Yes.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Yes.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
Would you like to tell me?
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Sister Marguerite I think.
A crucifix.
I don't know which one 
Where?
Yes.
Something they... that they overlooked.
You got to be crazy.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
When?
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Was there a priest?
Obviously there was.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
What?
Earthquakes?
The sheets...
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
Bullshit!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Become?  One is born a saint.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
You think she's a saint?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
I don't know... too late to stop it.
And the baby.
No!
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Lay them down.
Sixpence.
They'll be here.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Spoil sport!
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
Of course I can.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Get him out of here!!
It is, y'know.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Wake up!
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Is she?
See you.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
You can learn from books.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
What's he on about?
Don't dramatise.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
What little old man?
That little old man.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
He started it.
Aye, well, now! 
I would though.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Oh yes.
That's what you tell me.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Aren't we ...
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
But...
Paul's grandfather.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
He can't be far.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
I feel like shit...
Cattle ranch!
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Kill drive engines.
That's what I'm going to do.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Can you see anything in the hole?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Unknown.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
How's it coming on the engines?
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Is it alive?
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
How do we locate the creature?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
What do you mean, no?
We're not going anywhere.
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
It's not going to work.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
We've got about a week left, right?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Found what?
But?
Still worried?
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
You win.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
No... don't...
What can I do?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Better tell the boss.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Take a look at this.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Appreciate that.
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Compensate!
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Eddie what?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
You take charge.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Stars.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
What else?
She doesn't know.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
Yes, Addison.
Why not?
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
That's how you met me. In passing.
Margo.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Then you two must have a long talk-
Amen.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Huh?
I told her. I sounded off.
And cut that out right now.
You in a hurry?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
See you...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Gone.
I mix what I like.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Well, I am.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Find out.
What did you expect - live sables?
See you home...
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I don't intend to be.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-
Something most important you can do.
'Remembrance'.
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
I wouldn't like.
How far to the station?
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It doesn't matter.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Isn't that what they always say?
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
What is?
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
How do you mean?
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
She was a revelation...
I mean really, deeply angry...
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
Call, what call?
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
All you got to do is name it.
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Who'd you vote for?
When?
You want me to be the bastard.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
How high up, which Republicans?
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
What's the matter?
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I'm so glad.
And you will.  But not now.
Well of course.
I know where Dwight works.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
--Deep Throat?--
I think.
Just let me get a match.
...No... never in so many words...
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
Where?  What do you mean, where?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Mitchell knew then.
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
Talk about Segretti--
How grand?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Howard Hunt here.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
That was awhile ago.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--go over your sources again--
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
Sorry, coach.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Like what?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
No idea.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
I'm not playing.
...I've never tried it.
Do you love her?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Yeah, that's right.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
You fuckin' rule!
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
She's a mermaid, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Move with the music.
God dammit, Stifler!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
What?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
Dude, prom sucks.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Yep.
Uh huh.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
I don't know... Surprise me.
What?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I don't know...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Looks like he lied to you too.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Uncle Terrence.
Andy? Andy is that you?
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
What were you showing her?
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Good day!
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
Not you. Him.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Why?
You shouldn't have pushed us!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
Sad?
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
I'll never let go!
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
No. Empress, you --
I had nothing to do with it!
What's your name?
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
The alarm clock.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Oooh! Here! Here!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Oh, thank you.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
What? What?
Oh! Italian, right?
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Ooooh!
Of course.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Will it change your wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Oh. What?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm cool.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Yeah.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Don't get upset!
My head is throbbing.
Oswald and ghosts.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
Tsch, a few.
Are you?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Key word here is "indulgent."
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Just give me the license, please.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Where?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
SO?
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, yes, yes.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Had a little help?
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Well, probably.
Borrow whatever you like.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
So where is young Jonah?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
I love her too, Joe.
He's not going tonight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Lucy overdosed.
Monica.
Forget it, Judy.
A perfect night.
I adore him.
They're paying him scale.
There's still time to undo this.
Scout's honor.
Not.
I mean, you're really back.
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
And how hard it hit?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I'll never forgive you.
Me too.
Oh, Sally Mae...
Has she called?
Sure.
Ah.
Oh.  You're serious.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Sally!!!!
I think he's really angry with me too.
Yes.
I like you.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I so wish I'd known.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
The charades.
Oh?
Really??
Very.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Not enough.
You know it's true.
What does that mean?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
Hm.
The both of you.
Big time.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Right...because every ant's important!
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
Wanna dance?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Look around, sweetheart.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
And only you can become a Queen?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
And do Princesses do improper things?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Superior numbers, kid!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Ant Team Six...
ONE TO NOTHING!
...Not enough food?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Yes, what else?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
...Ants...
I'll be back.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Yeah, I know.
Under the mat? 
Sheldrake?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
It's a bet.
Why?
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
Sure.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
How come?
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I'll fix you some coffee.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Was he really upset when you told him?
Sure.
Gin.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
For me?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
We're going to finish that gin game.
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Mind if I come in?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Think.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
You're going to take her off my hands?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
You left your wife?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Sure.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
I'm not sure.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You got a girl-friend?
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
No kidding.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
I'm with you, lover.
Who?
A.W.O.L.?
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
That's right.
You know I liked it better long.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
We talked about a lot of things.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
Where does she live?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
It won't happen again.
See if they'll what?
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
What !
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
Sometimes.
How long were you up there ?
No shit.
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
Shot himself. What for ?
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
What is it?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
About what ?
But why ?
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
How big it is?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
No. Walked.
Can you trust them?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
I'm Kurtz.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Yeah.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
Yeah, I like it...
How's yours?
Oh Captain, that is so true.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
What's a big question?
The river is beautiful.
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Forget it.  It would take days.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You don't get it, do you?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
It's a spring day...
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
But I would.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
You met the gift.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Me. My home number is on this card.
Spencer.
Okay.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Oh, please...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How do you know about my mother?
How ya doing?
Why did yo do this for me?
Now I want you to do something for me.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
This one has a special meaning.
I'll take a bus.
So long.
What are you doing here?
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Well...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
No!!!
I just love her.  How're you doing?
Don't want to. I love you.
What the heck do you mean?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
Well, that's a load off.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Yeah...
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
What are you talking about?
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
We go around once.
That's right.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
I don't believe you.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
I know.  It was a joke.
Ten million --
Now you understand why I'm here.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
How?
What do you want to know?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Yes.
No.  Something honest.
You were there?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Okay.
Then, we wait.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
What did he want?
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
So?
I went into their room this afternoon.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
It happened to you before?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
What?
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Can you tell me about it?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Like you?
Because it's in English?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
I thought that was part of the charm!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Yeah, I'll take some.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
What are you on about?
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
What are you talking about?
Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
Sure I'm sure!
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
No!
Yeah, maybe.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
I hope so!
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Sure, I've done it easily.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Okay.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yo, dobree!
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
Insurance!
You mean it's started?
Yeah seems okay.
No!
Really!
Not all of them!
Working....Under cover.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
With you.
I do.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
That'd be something.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
You do --
Later.
You don't know me.
This play -- ?
-- Your act only works with an audience.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
My relationship with God is my own.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Then maybe you can read mine.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
And why would that scare me?
I'm not allowed to date.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Not possible.
Twice a year.
What about your father?
Sure.
What are you going to -- ?
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
That's what I mean.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I have expectations, too.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
Please.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I'd work backstage or something?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Seventeen.
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
Lemme see that.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
I'm going to be at the dance.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Yeah,  Right.
Shhhhhhhh!
Then where the hell is he?
Why?
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
You did what?!?
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
That's just what I needed to hear.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
What theater was I at?
Sure,.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
She plays the clarinet, too.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
You lost that one?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Nope.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Sure thing. Come on.
What'd you come out here for?
Yeah.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
What're you doing?
Cause I can't allow it.
It's okay.
Doing what?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Yeah.
Nothing.
There you go.
I know.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
No.
Don't ask me.
I can look and see.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He was nervous.
How's he doing?
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
They're stealing my chopper!
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
It?  Who does?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Go away.  Let me rot?
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
I have a radio fix...
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
You wrote his scripts for him?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Chet! From downstairs!
A week, eight, nine days 
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
I need help, Audrey.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well not much.
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Can be. Not easy, but 
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
See you, Charlie.
Seen a doctor?
That's all right, really 
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Hold on 
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Must be.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
No.
Yeah.
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
It's been three months.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
About a year and a half.
Yes, you do.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Fine.
It's not the same thing, is it?
What's it about?
She's seen everything before.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
I never have before.
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Funny.
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
Come over here and tell me no.
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
I told you.  She kills him.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Routine.
What kind of talk?
I hope I helped you out.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
I said keep it.
And you volunteered.
Did you check all four years?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
It's in New Jersey.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
That's good. At least they're interested.
I don't like beer.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Sure, ok..
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
What?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Who am I?
SAMO.
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
Your people.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
I guess it was a long time ago.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Me? Why?
Stand still.
Thanks
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
No, actually I feel worse.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
Wrong on both counts.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm listed.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Silent night, violent night...
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I don't.  So, no.
And a very, very good one.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
What is it?
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
I don't know.  It just feels right.
I hate being lectured.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
He'll be here.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
She knows who we are.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Then you never loved me?
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Why, indeed?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Big house. How many rooms?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
You do know. Try.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Everything.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
... Where are you calling from?
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
What are you, scared of heights?
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
And what did you say?
Hi.....  Roses.
No, I'm fine.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Isn't it?
Right.  Got it.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
You.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first! Me first!
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
My butt's bothering me!
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Um... ass... head...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Deep and hard.
That's better. Yes?
D.C., Chief.
Not now Bork.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Where are his pants?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh, ten uh...
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
That's my girl!
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
You can build another one... with her.
Just a hunch.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
Can you scare them off?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
You're the dead.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
No.  You don't want his help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Are you a spirit too?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
I think she's in with them.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
I see.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
He does, does he?
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
A Black man gave me the message.
Yes. I am.
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Oh? Certainly...
Hello, Eve.
No. I'm a gardener.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He does...?
Hello, Eve.
Fine. He's very nice.
Yes.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
I see.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
Thank you, Eve.
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
Thank you.
Yes. I like to watch.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
I see.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Oh, good.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
And I'm Ben.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I understand.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Thank you.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
Correct.
... Oh, really...
Sid, it's useless!
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
No problem, Chief.
Right, Chief.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Thank you, Colonel.
Yes, I did.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Who am I thinking of?
Tell your friends.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I have to go back now.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You've always hated the animals.
And he was with her.
I need a shower.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
The monkey.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I know.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yessir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
I wouldn't know.
Yeah.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Do we get to wear a crown?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Great then.
Who's calling?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
and she is mine...
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Thank you.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Won't you be late for work?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Better ask Paul D.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Huh.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Shit.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Fuck you.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
And this guy peed on it.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Am I wrong?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
I've had a--
Are these.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
You're not interested in sex?
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Dieter Hauff?
Well...yeah--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Mmnun.
Uh-huh.
What do you do for fun?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
I want a child.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Yeah, but--
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Agh--
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Wooden bridge, huh?
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
"Our" car, Walter?
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
Not if I have anything to say about it.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
No, I'm--
Huh?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
What's your point, Dude?
Hey, cool it Walter.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Help me put him back in his chair.
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
I'll heal.
Like cancer with a purpose.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Fry 'em.
What do you really think?
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Blood...
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Not alone.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
He was here.  Watching us.
You experimented on your own, son?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
How can you be out here?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Take him.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
But I just got here --
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
And that's a good thing?
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
I'm not leaving without you.
You're a week early.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Deacon brought me back.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
Go on, I'll be fine!
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
--which she may have--
Hey, folklore--
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Inside the grave?
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Then there she blows.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
--you should get back into bed.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
The, uh, blur there.
I want amphetamines.
No.
Never would've guessed.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What?
--coming out of the water--
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
No idea--goddamitt!
Next time try putting on shoes--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
<u>What</u>?
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--still go see the OB in the morning--
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
You planning on sleeping out there?
What'd you say?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
I'm sorry.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Does she, goddamnit??
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
In the trunk.
What do you want to know?
Remy.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Lubbock?
Sign.
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
What do you mean...
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Has Ray come in yet?
Don't throw that out.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
What?
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. cheers.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Yeah.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Can I feel 'em?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Well.
Never before this.
I . I don't know.
See my breasts?  . See?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Don't say that.
O.K.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
I asked first.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
They hurt his head.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
No thanks. what does that mean?
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
What kinda beer do you like?
Yes.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Where are they?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Let's go.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Well. Okay.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Okay.
... Stop it Mike.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
No.
No.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
You?
I don't want to talk about it.
Murder.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
Good night.
No, my brother.
Now do you see what I am saying?
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
You fucked me, Diego.
Cocaine?  How much?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long?  A week?
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Beautiful girls?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Alright.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
George, he wasn't asking.
Better than you.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
I'll be here.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Yeah?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
The strike is a success; but ...
And here?
Second district ...
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
Sure. By shooting at me.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
I don't do that kind of thing.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
How?
But there's more?
Yes.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Yes.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No -- never.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
I have.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Yes.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
What did Mr. Marsh say?
Yeah.
Show me.
For about one year.
And how are you now?
It didn't.
Why not?
She left me.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
Yes -- several times.
What did she say?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
I suggest it never happened.
What did you prescribe for her?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
What about Miss Lawson?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
He video taped you.
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
Yes.
--and that he changed his will?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Dristan nasal spray.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
You know I can't talk about that.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
I thought the subject was sex?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
It's only the beginning.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
You better.  Please answer the question.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yes.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Well, that's a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, I can help.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Did we want to?
They got heat in Michigan.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
How long you been married?
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
About a year and a half.
Must be nice having kids.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
We got engaged.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
Francesca?
Francesca?
Why doesn't it scare you?
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Oh, sure. Great.
No. I can't. Not yet.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
I sat outside and had coffee.
No, I don't mind.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Well, what is this?
How do you know what I experience?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
No. Don't do this.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Betty.
What's she like?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
Cremated?!
Apparently just before her death.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
He yours, sir?
Died there?  How?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
What it will be.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
You always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Have you ever been inside?
Please.  It's for your own good.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Bill!  Bill?!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I didn't sell it.
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Potential toxic dump site.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Evidence of what?
The same way you did before.
I think you're fucking crazy!
What the fuck is going on?
They just left, didn't they?
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Violet, please!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
What happened to them?
He can't kill you --
Everything you couldn't.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Pretty good, sir.
Sure.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Me?  Why?
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Yeah, that's it.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
Sure.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Five years is a long time.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
Good.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I know you will.

Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
Yes.
...they won't let you go...
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Look, maybe I should just...
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
We thought you were gone for good.
Get the fuck away from my car.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
-- you could put it together --
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
We're about an hour away.
I guess.
Anytime.
-- how? --
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Yes.
So get the hell out of here.
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
He run away often?
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
-- we're evacuating the building --
What have you done to my flat?
... have a look.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... yer ducts.
... new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
... get to it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Her name is Jill.
Even later.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What has Tuttle done?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
They weren't at school with us.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
We don't make mistakes.
Trust me.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Yes we have, Jack!
What?
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
You think these are tits don't you?
It's you ... it's you ...
No.
Why?
A heavy Christmas present.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Turn around!
What?
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
27156789/074328/K.
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
You are good to me Sam.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Er, yes ...
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Fixed?
Not ... as such ...
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
Are you saying this is illegal?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
No. Wait here.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
It's a miracle.
No underwear?
Mary ...
Got a beer?
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
You're going to live.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
He's dead, huh?
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
No.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
How is she?
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
The ghosts--
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
The brakes are shot.
That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
What do you want to break?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
What?
You're burned out.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Did you bring your grey suit?
No.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Your hair's a little funny.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Move away from me.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Yes.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
I'll speak to you.
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
Yes, sure.
How are you at back rubs?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Okay.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
This is hysterical.
What?
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
Oh it's enough...
N-no...
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
All about me...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Forget it.
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well...
Have a seat -
You might talk too much.
You're like an undercover guy!
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Suit yourself.
Hiya Maxwell.
Really?
T-turned on?
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Suck!
We hate you guys!
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
Wheels?
Don't tread on the earth?
Eeyuu.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Something like that.
Hi.
Jealous?
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I'm here with Jenny.
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Merrick...
I'm going to the senior dance.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
) What do you think?
Why don't we see a movie?
Oh my God you're having an affair.
What are you talking about?
Wait!
China.
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
I have to show you.
Cramps?
All right.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
We'll cover it later.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Uh... gym.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Try to pay attention.
You are such a wet.
As for example, what?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Football is my life.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
I was just scared is all.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Later for it.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
No --
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
You want some punch?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I don't think so.
You can learn to like it.
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
Nuke?!
No, no, it was great.
Yes I do...
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I think you're real cute.
--but you're father's in there!
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Annie, I think you should leave.
Who?
If you believe in Voodoo.
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You're outta here!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
And where can I go?
Pussy.
Take the first shot at me.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Don't try me.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
She's playing with my mind.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
What are you talking about?
You were wandering around.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
I don't know.
Matter of fact...
I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
Honey, come here.
It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
Okay.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Hey, Rich.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You lost your control.
Yes, you lost your control.
Please...
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
Meet me at three.
No, a...
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
What are you -
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
No, I'm not okay.
Well...
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
You bet.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Half of everything is mine.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
We can't get rid of him?
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I - I - I...
Understand?  I'm sorry.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Why're you crying?
Yeah. Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
Why do you need that much?
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You can trust me.
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!
I put her to bed.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I should have -
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Listen to me.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Let me in the house! Fucker!
But it was just mine.
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Well, I... I never tried.
Get out of here.
...I got muscled on the street.
Yeah.
Shut your mouth!
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Hey.
Can I go in?
I did - I didn't -
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
He's gone?
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Fine, fine.
It's in all the papers.
Of course, Remo.
And how are things going down there?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Yeah?
Let me think about that.
Okay.
Mm-hm.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Exactly.
Yeah.
A sponsor.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Okay, then.
Lester - he called you here.
Right.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
I think that's it.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Two.
Two?
Yeah.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
What's takin' so long over there?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
She asleep?
Hey, Shelly. 
This is Nick.
They're havin' a good time too.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Fuck you!
Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Take it easy, though.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I wonder..
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
What little boy doesn't?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
What do you want from me?
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Why am I still troubled...
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...
Whatever you say...Sis.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
What's the good news?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
I improved on the fucking original.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
What do they need her for?
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
26th off Wilshire.
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I can hear you again, clearly.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Even if you found us -- what then?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
What's going on?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Did you hear that click?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Lucky for them they didn't.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
You're going to let them get away with this?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
The guy with the transplant.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
L.A.P.D.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
You, I would've noticed.
You wouldn't --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Negative.
And then?
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
What does it take to kill you?
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Mind if I have a look?
Who are you?
There's no lady here.
Government business?
What would you call it?
It's him, isn't it?
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
No.
And what's it like?
Not me.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Like what?
As different as it's possible to be.
I am.
Maybe.
What does that mean?
All the time.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Ask to meet me again.
A little.
Sorry.
He'd bring me carnations.
Do you like me even a little bit?
Afraid so.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
You knew my Jody?
Stop it, Dil --
I like you, Dil --
Tell me you love me.
Not if you go.
The Metro.
Yes. Say hello to Col --
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Can't.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
What do you mean?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Yes?
It's your decision.
Are you all there?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
I seen your fucking face.
So, what do I look like?
I can smell her perfume.
Can't we take it off?
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
What?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
What?
I'll bear that in mind.
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
It's as simple as that?
Some kinds of women are...
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
When I was a child...
Yeah?
What does that mean?
Tell me something, anything.
Hurling --
You didn't?
Whatever you say, Jude...
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
That's right.
No -- I guess not.
What?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Open up.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
No.
May I have a cigarette, please?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
But you're -- divorced?
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Okay -- up there.
Open it.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
I'll take that.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
I'm scared.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Yes.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
But his mother --
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I don't know.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know.  I'm sorry.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
Okay.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Peter Joshua.
Please, not on my account.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
I'm not sure I --
How do you know?
Are you in the book?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
We'll find you a hotel.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
That's all.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Do you tell lies?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
He took care of Charlie for us.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
You said that two weeks ago.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I will. Is that all?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
No honey.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
She's underage.
She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
You're not?
Who's?
Then you should go.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Does she fuck?
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
NO?!
Mark invited me to the party.
Ok.
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
What?
I did.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
I'm making you feel like meat?
That's not why we broke up.
Don't make me order you.
What?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
And she didn't?
No, you keep one.
Okay, okay.
Oh...
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
He could've called first.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
For cryin' out loud.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
Peace.
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
No.
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
No, no, no.
...the ice cream for money!
What?
 Nice job back there.
Kiss my ass!
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...truck!
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
Come on, old...
All right, you got it.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Okay. 
Come on.
...Pete!  Come on.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
Come on.
Come on...
...you crazy bastard.

Hang on!
No.  Shit.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
...you're dealin' with!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
What?
Okay.  Okay.




Worth a try.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
It won't even start half the time.
So you took his...
So I took his truck, yeah.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
To tell you the truth, you didn't.

Are you all right?
Arlo!  Arlo.

 Okay.
Come here.
What?
Stop.
...here comes the...

Sorry.
They'll meet you at the top.

Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who put the big hurt on...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Us.  Owes us.
Thank you very much.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Be cool.  Be--
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
...within five minutes.
Well, well, well.
And it won't be pleasant. 
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
...including the permanently extreme.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
Now listen to me.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Grateful?
Mm-hm.
Almost quaint.
Brynner.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Check it out.
...-ther orders?
Move!
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Iced coffee.
...deer.
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
...Long.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.



...it.
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
 Two pots of coffee...
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Kabula's out.
...now!
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
Uh-huh.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

Been trying to figure out your secret.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...back...
...is death.
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
What?
We've got the real thing!
Do you recognize this young man?
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
 Pappas!  Move the car!
...there's a colonel...

BLACK BACKGROUND.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
'Course you do, Jake.
A ruler?
Do you know him?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
That's too bad.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Is she all right?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
How do you do that?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Just bring your checkbook.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
I think I'll kill her.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Tell her later.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Jake, listen.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
I get by.
Who?
Yeah?
I heard it was an accident.
Matter of fact I do.
Where?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Gittes, stay outta this.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
What are you having?
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I said I'll drop it.
What do you mean?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
I'll stop by.
I was grateful.
Why?
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
No.
They can't be.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
The police?
Then let's go talk to her.
I want to see her.
What did you do that for?
She's my sister and my daughter!
Sophie.
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
A Miss Sessions calling.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
There's just one question.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
What about the water?
That's a long fall.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Yeah.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
No, you have a press agent do it.
But that's what you told your wife.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
So what's that got to do with it?
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I can't take shorthand.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Oh!
Look at that.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Charlie?!
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?

Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Thanks.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
At night?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Yes.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
All right.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
A wasted day.
I mean I've got a job for you.
Yes?
I'll get you some coffee.
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Yes.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
What check?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
How do you do, Charles?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Queer?
Millions - if anybody wants it.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Are you serious?
This? How long have you been smoking?
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Dick.
Exactly.
Can I use the bathroom?
Awww. That was so cute.
I feel nauseous.
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
But can we date?
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Call the police.
With this guy locked in?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
So I'm told.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
What smells like shoe polish?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
I'm talking to myself here.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Yeah.
More or less.
I think they were Catholics.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Nudie booth?
The milkmaids?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
What?
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Number six.
You've had sex with a dead person.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
How'd he die?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I don't want to talk to you.
You're happy to get a fine?
What did she say?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
What time did we go to the funeral?
I was born.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Yes.
To you?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
With you? I don't think so.
Nothing personal.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Maybe.
Actually, that's his night job.
I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
Here. Now leave me alone.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why do you say that?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Three?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
That's because I never had sex with him!
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Please calm down.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Um. Thirty-seven.
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I feel sick.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
I do about three-fifty, four.
No, I wasn't.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Twenty bucks?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Bye. 
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Hal will have my head for this.
What usually eats a banana?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
The clip's not gonna hold!
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
My pleasure.
Give him the money.
Fine, I guess...
Three...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Why are you yelling?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Where's Hal, what's going on?
What about you?
Remember the first time we came up here?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Yeah?
Take the rope.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
There is.
What are you talking about?
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Ask the questions.
What about it?
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
No. She's dead!
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
Fine, sir, fine.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
No, sir, I feel really great.
What job and how much?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Oh.
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
I was quite enjoying that.
Yes!!!
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
The ride is free.
You got a deal.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Just had one.
In my office?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
The crowd had to dig it.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
...if they're wrong?!
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
No.  You say you're cool.
With what?
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
Yeah.
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
How about the thingy next to it?
How can you kill him like that?
I never learned jazz.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Makes two of us.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
Who's Heller?
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Answer the question.
Slow down!
Who?
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
Drop me off here!
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Shut the hell up.
Not for years.
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You bit someone's nose off?
What?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Really?
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
Nothing is easy.
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
Can you prove any of this?
Shoot.
How'd he die?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Jerry, I --
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Thanks.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
The truth shall make you free.
Please, sit.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
No doubt.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
It'll just take a moment.
What would you have me say, David?
And?
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
It's a civilian facility.
Is that your official response?
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
Could we hear to the moon?
Okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Now... you go home.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
And?
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
You sonofabitch.
I'm -- I'm fine.
How long was I gone?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
Spoken like a true believer.
How do you mean?
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Oh.  I brought you something.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
You don't know!
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
He's gonna be awright.
Well, whatta we got here?
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You just said he could eat anything.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter.
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Give in? That's our Luke out there.
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
I want to die.
But </u>alive</u>!
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Who was the man in the basement?
You know I can't do that.
You know where.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Who?
Because of your phone calls.
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
Let me get a little action started here.
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'll get a locksmith.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Okay.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
Yeah, everything's different.
Helen... excuse me, we...
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
I know.  Get out here.
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
Give me Ruben back...
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
No. But when he's in that car...
Have you seen his penis?
One of my suitors.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
The case could be made.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Really?
But everything's OK?
You look beautiful.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
I didn't say...
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Ruth's already taken him home.
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
Just remember that I love him.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
Lie?
Terrific.
That must be really difficult.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
Paul.
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
No, I need some serious household advice.
Really?
Are you OK?
Michael, take it easy.
Yeah, the plans.
Letty, please.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
What does that mean?
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
A pass.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
They left about a half hour ago.
Where did they go?
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
What?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
-- Super what?
Why are you here?
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
We'll think of something.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
Some bread and...
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
-- Did you set it up?
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm not going to leave you.
We both know I'm already dead.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.

Hey, you know you can't this in France.
Get in the car.
The hell it is.
No shit?
Yeah, I dig him.
Oh, you think?
Glenmorangie.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
It's not your fault.
Stick around and find out.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
I do as I please.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Let's go!
Shut up!
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
You're too young to understand.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Then you have no use for the sword.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Make a wish, Lo.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
What about you?
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
What do you have in mind?
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
I dabble.  May I?
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
She's still dead.
Oh.
I don't know you.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
18k.  Crap.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Who got himself what?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
You a lesbo?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
You talking to me?
The Fountainhead.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Refreshing.
Shut up.
No thank you.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
And you promise to abide by it?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
Not at all. Have a seat.
I think that's for the best.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Those are my letters!
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Did you hide the letters?
What do you mean?!
Why didn't you do something?
I want to go home.
Is it me?
Good night Cecile.
I know.
It works a little.
Yes.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Who is this?
Yeah?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I hate it too.
Any day now.
I'm aware.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Who are you spying on?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
So? How'd it go last night?
Exactly the opposite.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Kind of.
Well done.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
War it is.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
I need to talk to Annette.
She's out.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
Did you ever make a wish?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
What?
It's your play.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
I live right here.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
Why didn't you run after them?
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I can not tell you.
I shall want you for always.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I shall wear it in my hair!
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
A lady threw it to me.
It's a pretty ring.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
That means I can go alone?
But she's such a nice lady.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you hear it?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Yes...yes, that's true.
Go on -- out with you.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
At Victoria's Secret.
It's not just in my head.
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
My shrink says he's not so bad.
He's a very talented musician.
People notice you Frida.
Only to see.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And my bra finally fits again.
I wonder if he's married.
What the hell is the tampon test?
I looked like an Italian man!
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
No they're not.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
What choice do we have?
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
On your desk.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
So what book did you buy?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Goodnight.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
Tell her I'm eating.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
And fifth, you're dating her.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
How will we interrogate them?
You are mistaken.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Well be more careful, please.
Put it through...
I don't know who they are.
Wait, this isn't fair...
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
I'm...  being...  punished.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
They're dead, John.
That's easy.  You...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
You're kidding?
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
I mean,  if it's a problem...
What the hell is this ?
I don't give a shit.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
What about containment, Alan?
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Are you out of your mind?
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
He was only doing his job.
Sort of... Yeah.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
What?
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
We vetoed that?
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
The Fidelity nonsense...
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
What?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
We'd like to hire you.
You got a gun?
Uh...
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
Where are you going?
It's just so strange...
What?
I guess.
I know. I'm sorry...
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
What is it if it ain't a curse?
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
In the battle, sir.
To fucking Mutt.
Don't come.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Knox?
Knox Overstreet.
Women swoon!
But why?
Yeah.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
So much the better.
What?
Sure.
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
It's Nuwanda.
You know,
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
You can't be in here.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Are you going with Chet?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Then you can help him.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
What?
Found what?
And now he will?
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
I'll come to the performance.
I don't know.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Not an option.
Then you better start swimming.
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
I have been.
Where is everybody?
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
Fucking women, man...
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Good... Pass the beer.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
I'm telling you, they changed it!
It's Nick!
Yeah.
You don't!
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
You are frightened, no?
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Not so good.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I... No. You do this for money?
Who the hell knows!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I know.
Yeah.
The shot?
Fucking A.
I don't think about the shot that much.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Well, where's he from?
What do you mean, no???
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Great. Hey. That's great.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
What'cha got, Bennett?
I'd think about it.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
We have to talk.
What are you talking about?
He could be brought back.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Ooops, I forgot.
Are you a cop?
Got it.  Ejection seat?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
My insurance won't cover it.
When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
Relax, let technology do the work.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
No, sir.
I'm here.
...Have you been drinking?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You be careful.
But he was such a good cop.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
We will --
Belle --
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
No. She's gone.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
He was --
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
There's no joy in it for me.
Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
How much?
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Your butter money?
Mary -- it's gone.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Worried!
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
All right, Jabez ...
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
What's that?
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Just someone from New Hampshire!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
I object.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
And if he alters it...?						*
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
I'm a cop from New York.
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
You don't want to know.
Hey, you couldn't know.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Yessir.
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
No.  I never smile any more.
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
They're not after you, they're after me.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
It's okay... it's okay...
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
It looks like a whole roast.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
You alone, or you got confederates?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
... armed robbery ...
What do you want?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
I don't fool around with you.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
We like you, too.
What now, Sonny?
Okay.
What about Howard?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
No, that's all.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
I want him to think that.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
But I want to know what you think.

I never been up in a plane before.
All right. 
Bullshit!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Open this up!
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Oh my God, mother!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Not now, Mom, please.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Yep.
I don't know.
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What was you saying?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
What makes Sammy run?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I'm coming.
See ya around.
Stop tripping.
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Can you pay me now?
No, just checking.
You don't know shit about shit.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
When?
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Then we'll do something else.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
No rawness.
Tina, I'll be right back.
I am a man.
Later.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
What?
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
I didn't know you could read.
It's e-vit-able.
That's what I think.
I understand.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
You listening to me?
Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.

Tell 'em, Pop.
Don't start on me today.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
You did?
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
O'clock?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I'm fine.
What?
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
Home school? What's that?
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
You're not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
No.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
I kinda screwed things up.
I don't think so.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
The answer is George Jefferson.
No. What happened?
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
No. Look.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
Well, what should we do?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
Oh I think you do.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Do we have a deal?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
I reckon so.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Yes you are. 
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Who's there?
It's a surprise.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Love it!
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
Yes?
Yes?... How was your journey?
Yes.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
I can't... I can't.
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
We call that one Muad'dib.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!

Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?

SILENCE!
Those sounds could be imitated.

Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Really?
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andtruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
I don't understand.
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Rolling.
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Isn't he?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Better than not getting a job?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Toss us out on our ass.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
But there's plenty of other parts.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Would that work?
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
I like to think so.
I think you're quite handsome.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Tits.
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
Who?
OUR picture?
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
"Dracula."
Okay?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
Yes?
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
What's uncanny?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Mr. Wood!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Anything good?
They celebrated the common person.
You're nuts.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
A woman wants to be pursued.
Leave her be.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
This guy.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Your brother's here.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I hear the dog really liked him.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Oh... how come?
I know, I ...
Everybody hates me!
Look at this.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Really? 
I'm sorry.
Somewhere.
...yeah?
No. It's your fault.
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
What are you drunk?
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Why do you do that?
No. What happened?
Oh, Jesus.
Great.
Me?!
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Oh, man! So...
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Ed?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
I'm looking at new cars.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Good for you.  Good for you
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Doing what?
Take as much room as you want
Walt needs to see you.
Still clear?
Yep.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Sherry... I love you.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
What do you mean?
What...?
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Paul, get out!
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
I'm not sure.
It's Bud.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
So you saved her.
We talked.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Of course... But how?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
No!  Please leave!
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
She told you?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
At least not anymore.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
What little studio?
I got her address.
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Until he gunned down six people.
I don't own no shotguns.
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
They shot him in his library.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
And?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
You sound like you mean it.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
Where is he?
On what evidence?
Do you have any proof?
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
A sweet man.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Showbiz.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Nothing.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Really?
That's who they are.
Okay.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
I was a traffic analyst.
Yeah.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Here?
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Who?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Are you sure about this?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
<u>What's</u> your point.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
Anything at all?
For your wife?
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
Have you been working with Rachel?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Oh, please--
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Here, you can use this.
It's not?
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Never.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Why would I--
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
I <u>did</u> care how.
Yeah.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
--otherwise we may have to--
Gimme the shoe.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Oh, well, that's true.
Fuck off.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Why would the Union--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Alright!
No "900" numbers.
Just be cool.
Ssh!
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Why would the NSA--
You gotta--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
To the cops?
Turn yourself in.
I need help.
Are you okay?
What does that have to do with you?
What?
What about the tapes?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Get it.
Hiding something?
If they've looked at the video.
Excuse me?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
You felt obliged to.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
It's a folk song.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
It hurts too much.
Don't leave me!
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need ithard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Or was it Toronto?
Are you Hana?
Bonjour.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Very true!
What?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Candaules
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Are you crazy?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Yes?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
I've been told that before.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I don't think it's indifference.
Never heard of it.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Is something funny?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I don't think so.
So I follow the wires?
I follow the wires.
I try not to expect you.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
Nya-nya-nya!
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What's he saying?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
Or my wife's.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
Who am I?
Then don't.
That's good. Terrific.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Possibly.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
I'm not the one to ask...
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Let's just see how we do.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
To our...partnership.
You were afraid of heights?
Something like that.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
Can't be too careful.
Surgically attached.
There is one more thing.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
I'm not leaving without you.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Remind me why.
We're supposed to.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Jesus.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
For what?
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Excuse me?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Course I did.
Find out.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
<u>No</u>.
What do you mean?
You didn't care about my case?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
The extortion, the threats ...
Take it.
Ross.
I guess I did.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
How come you're not eating?
George!
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
When?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
How would you know?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
About what?
I can't leave my job, George.
I will.  Bye.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Barks and growls at his boss.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks his right on!
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Because of my father, I guess.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
Sit down, and shut up!
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
I'm going to see what it is.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
And what are they, pray tell?
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Yes, you do.
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
You're going to attack them?!!!
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Thanks to you.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
We have no use for your kind.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
I'll be back later.
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But tell me why ...
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
It is the future you see.
And I too.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
He's a gorilla.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Where?
Dream on, blue eye.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
What's the little black box do?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Does he know how to activate it?
Right over there.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Yeah, kinda.
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
Down that way.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
The what?
I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
Thank God.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
It is deep...
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
I want to thank you.
In the great book.
What book is that?
Guenevere...
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Because you and the land are one.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
You.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
I?
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
And you got an invitation.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
A man to see you.
How are you today?
It affects concentration.
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
The priest.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
What else?
Have you told him what's happening?
Father?
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
How do you know?
Okay.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
What's playing.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
La plume de ma tante.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
It's possible. Possible however
Bastards! Stop!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
You're not going to drive.
Yeah, come on in.
Mondays.
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Frank.
How many?
Oh.
What's wrong with the kid?
Accident?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
When they coming in?
Jack.
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Terrific.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
She'll get here.
Here, how's this?
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
Just a lucky guess.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Good idea.
Why would I mind?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Celebrating.  Join me?
He was just having fun.
Cancel, Frank.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
Impersonally.
We ran long.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
Zip me up?
Piece of cake.
Give me that.
Virgins.
First times. Hey, look at this.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Forget it.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Job.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Right.  Bring him back.
Come on, Ed.
He doesn't bite.
He'll come around.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Every year.
In and out.
It's a shitty  song.
Better than that.
I'm not upset.
All I said was you were good.
Ed? How many people live here?
Long story.
Nervous?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
So ... ?
I've given it up.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
He's got blood in his eye.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
How old is he?
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
For what?
No.
Jon, what is it?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
That's what they always say.
Damn right.
Go on.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Not if I kill you first ...
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
Janie?
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
No problem.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
You always say that -- then you leave.
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
Call me spontaneous.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Is that tonight?
Why Jack?
But I think I like you better this way...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Wheres my real dad?
I think I could figure it out.
Check...
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Thats where you work.
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Howd you know my name?
I never won anything in bowling.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Hey...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
How much time?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Need a nurse?
Uh huh...
I was in the city.
Because thats where I live.
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
...my feet are hurtin...
That is the general idea, yes...
Excuse me?
Really.
How would you look at it?
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
But you always seem so certain.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Its wonderful...
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Not with what they pay me...
Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
Last night was great...
Tonight.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
You'd never know it.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Youthful high spirits.
I had it at four.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
Victor's better at these things.
<u>Should</u>?
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Give me a mirror...
Give me the god damn mirror!
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
What about you?
I can go hotter!
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Okay, "mom."
Sweet.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Ben's still out there --
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Passion.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
Excuse me?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
And reverse the mutations --
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Raising the shields.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
What're you getting at?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
We're pushing oxygen today.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I have no idea.
A surgeon might...
What gives you that idea?
It's too late now. We must go on.
You left something out.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
What about Dr. Michaels?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Then don't drift down further.
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Yah.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Oh, geez.
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Any others?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
And what about the other fella?
Uh-huh.
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Sir? Right now?
Yah, real good.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Okay.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Jerome Lundegaard?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
...Yah.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
...Huh?
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
No, see -
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Oh, yah?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
No way.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Nope.
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Oh. Geez.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
No, no.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah.
Right, right.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Have you finished those reports?
Does this sound strange to you?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Who do you think could've done this?
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
In case we want to switch nights.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I don't know ...
When?
I don't know.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
You're afraid to say.
What is wrong with you?
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Who's this?
Who's this?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
My suitcase was vibrating?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Don't I?
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
Strange.
The fight.
Hum.
A liposuction clinic.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, I'm not...
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Tell him!
Tyler...
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
What are you talking about... ?
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
You... you can't be serious about this.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm going to...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Not exactly according to plan.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Noooo, please...
You will.  You know you will.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
You told me you'd say that.
Well, sir, you said you might.
Yesssss...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
What?
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
...My Premonition was just like his.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Sure.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
I know, Dad.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I'm... really sorry.
Right. April 25th.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
I wish you were on the plane!
"Next?"
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
What's that?
You stopped.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Batteries not included.
I've seen worse places.
There are no worse places.
Pirates?  No kidding?
I suppose you have...
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
I thought he was with you.
Huntington Beach, California.
I couldn't get you in.
Let's get that tent down!
Why me?
I'm not jumping blind.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Nice work.
Black.  No sugar.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
It's not necessary.
Have fun.
I could take it or leave it.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
There were treating me like a headcase.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Well, there's nobody special!
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
Why this is outrageous!...
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
And who's Lydia?
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
No... it's just...
No.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
No...no...we can't...we can't..
No, I have to work.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Parry!
What are you doing?  Give that back!
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
So what? You going to help me?
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
What a gyp.
What are we about to do?
No, I...
Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
No, dammit, I would easy.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
I don't, huh?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Washington.
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
I didn't get it, did I?
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
You know who it once belonged to?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
What?
Yeah, well, he's...
My turn.
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
That's what you said?
I'm fine.
Yeah, I think I could.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
What?
You're all full of shit!
It's all right. I'm fine.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Besides being very rude.
That's an old maid's tale.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
So get the fuck outta here.
That's it?
Wussup, Victor.
I'll be right down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm a good friend of hers.
You're kidding.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I wasn't asking.
Fletch, this is dumb.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
You're lucky.
Full name.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
That a boy.
Thank God, the police.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Your aunt?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea.
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
You don't know me.
Nothing. They're still there.
I'm fine.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
Are you serious?
Till then.
I'd have been long gone.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Velma.
Since he moved to L.A.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Course he has. That's his wife.
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Of course they are.
Where are you going?
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
They busted me last week.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Twenty years.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Why not?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Who?
Come inside.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
Spot right here.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
No, thank you.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John! You used to fly together!
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
You ordered it here?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Here, take mine.
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
Long story.
What does all this mean?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
I'll take you to a game.
No.
Gail, please.
Bastard.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Come here.
I want to hear this.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
No wonder.
She moved out?
...never reads the paper...
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
What...
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Yeah.
Of course.
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Did she tell you anything?
But I am...
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Wha --
Three hundred.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Fluck you!
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
I don't need it that bad.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
The case!
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Go on, another time, another place.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
No. 
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Non!
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
We must follow it.
Who financed it?
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
What?
Fake it.
Willie Mays.
Why not?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Four.
Pass.
Darling, may I have this one?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
I been damn careful up to now.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
Hey, bud.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
He did.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I think you know, Frank.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
Frank, this is insane...
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Yeah...I think so.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Yeah, you betcha.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Which means he probably knew her.
Uh, huh.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I don't know...
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
Yes, man!
I love you, man!
No.  I got here just before you did.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Don't say any more.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
No.
Nancy.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's very colorful, chief.
Tell me.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Don't do anything stupid.
You don't know shit!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
I'm literally going to kill you!
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
What are you going to do?
I guess not.
We have to get off this ship!!
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
What are you talking about?
Just felt a little chill.
I gathered that.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
What is your location?
Yes...
I heard you weren't coming.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
But Rennie...
Very bad today.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Alla puttanesca.
Press a button and they give us money.
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Don't wait Efor me.
That was a big mistake.
Paisley Porter.
Unbelievable.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
This could be it.
The Red Sox
It's your best play, Nicky.
Opening night?
What else?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
All right. What's been going on?
How prominent?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
Where the hell are you?
Get yourself something to eat.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Since when did that matter?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
They're my team.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I was educated by nuns.
Mine was cobalt blue.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
A little.
One more time.
I hear good things about the new play.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?
Yes.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
Even as a boy I thought so.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I --
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
That's when you take advantage.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
All right. Fine.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
What about this?
You had to be a right-hander.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
In a corridor.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
You worried about the cost?
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
What exactly is wrong?
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
There's a problem, Lamar.
What do you add up to here?
Get it over with...
No way. I've got to get out now.
I've been doing my homework.
Fatter... some things never change.
That's not all of it.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
There are three men dead.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
He must have.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
I did I killed a man.
Not now.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I guess you're right.
You want to try with me?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Yeah.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh my God.
Might try that.
What about you?
Wire pull over?
Just sandwiches...
Just fine.
What's it to you?
That's what I want.
How long have you been married?
Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Good evening.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Yes.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Yes.
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Could you do me a favour?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Was it Albert?
Who set it up?  Eric?
Oh, what you doing now?
Where's that?
Did you work with him, Keith?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
It just would. He was always the same.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Definitely.
It'll cost you.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
Do you want breakfast?
No. Are you tired?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
They're friends of mine.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Yeah.
Yes.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You did?
They came in and they, you know...
It's too...
Some contest board...
Eh...?
...cower in his boots...
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
He's doing very well.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
With River Oaks?
What?
No.
How?
Not actually, no.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
That's right.
I'm sorry?
You.
Yes.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
I didn't ask to be.
That's none of your fucking business...
Do you need five grand?
You need money?  Is that the...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
Because you listened.
Uh-huh.
They stole...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Yeah.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Where was I?
At home.
Was I?
Why?
They're inured to it.
You understand?
We had a robbery. 
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Levene!!
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Get in the goddamn room.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Under him?
It isn't me...
Yes.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Twenty percent.
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
No.
I can't do it, Shelly...
I can't split them.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
What does that fucking mean?
What?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
Well, hadn't it?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
You did?
Fuck you.
"Always be closing..."
Harriett...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Kenilworth...?
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Ricky...
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
Tell me again.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She told me I have to.
What...?  Say the words.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck the Machine.
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
Your farewell to the troops?
Have a good trip.
Aren't you going out today?
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
You would risk your life for strangers?
I'm not afraid of his words.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
I understand...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Yeah, some deal I made.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
We were all upset about that.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What is it?  Can I help?
It's the way Pop wanted it.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
He's an Italian?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
 And he agreed?
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Goddamn it, where were you?
I took care of it.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
I don't know.
I know he's in Israel.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
Is he related to the witness?
The witness is excused; take him out.
This meeting is adjourned.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
The baby I lost...
Who do you think you're talking to?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
However I can help you...
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
So, that occurred to me.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Turnbull is a good man.
Are we going to eat or what?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
Fuck you.
What's to be jealous of?
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
And your name is --?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
But it's just my face you want to draw.
What?
All right, I guess.
Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
All righty.  I understand.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Sorry.  Not today.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Better work.
You first.
I want -- I want...
No harm done.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
I don't hear anything.
Good.  Let's get dry.
Do I have any other choice?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Never gave it much thought.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Not at all.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You're planning a trip?
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Pray you, undo this button.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
Have a drink?
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
Then take the pills.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
You only embarrass yourself.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
That's what I'm trying to explain.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Just go.  We can manage without you.
A visitor.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Right.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Tell me about Kip -
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
I'm just here about my brother.
How is he?
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
You'll leave -- ?
You know my back.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
I don't think so, Detective ...
What do you want from me?
Double-meaning intended, right?
Yeah.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Gray.
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
And there she is --
one minute -- !
You, too, Ma...
oh.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Of course ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Whatcha got left ... ?
We'll take it.
Yeah... You want a ride...
Just hold-on there --
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
He's gonna kill you -- !
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Thank-you ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Nah.
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
No problem -
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
I understand -
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
Deodorant.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
I think so... They're just... So ...
Oh, God...
The alarms go off ...
Hear you roar ...
I dunno. I know a place.
She does have one thing you don't.
Is he still working here ?
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
Not really -
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Liar!
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Shit.
Never.
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
How?
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
We'll pick it up.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
--or a tail--
What are we gonna do up there?
No, and we got four of 'em.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Shut up.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
And what do you see?
What're you doing?
Hey fuck you.
What're those?
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
Of course.
--that?--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Then don't set up any more meetings.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Yes.
It's Saturday.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
My kind of background?
I'll be okay.
You too, Gerry.
Jobs doing what?
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, come on, Sean--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--I don't have any anger at you--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
He's not you!
Where're you going?
Sounds good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
What?
That's very presumptuous.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
You think so?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
I don't know.
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
Yeah.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
They could see that I meant it.
You're kiddin' me.
No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
Define that.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
What?
You're not going to fail me are you?
Yes.
The wrench, why?
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
You're Welcome, Will.
Only if you grab my ass.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
What?
So you just want to use me and go?
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Do you keep in touch with them?
We'll do that.
They don't come over here that much.
No.
Clearly.
So, do you play the piano?
I can't go out to California.
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
At least you have a mother.
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Don't hold me so tight.
You're *ticklin' me!*
I guess that's what he looked like.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Sure, but what is this?
But--but how we gonna eat?
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Hush!
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Take her with you!
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
That's right. And douse some in it.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
Won't they come out here?
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
You people looking for work?
Can you pick peaches?
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
--Stop it--
--No.
Don't say that.
Okay. See you later.
You could've been a contender, huh?
To make a long story short...
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
You're fucking psycho.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Is it something you've done?
I was leaving.
I'll hide.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Is that right?
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
Okay.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Wait a minute--
One cannot love and kill.
All of it?
In Detroit. This weekend.
They were very upset.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You too.
Poor thing.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
I think they call it a pasture.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Who's there?
Hi.
Hi.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Tch. What are you --
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Do you? Do you really?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
No.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
No. I am a "tubab."
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
They fired you?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
Yeah.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
You know, you're a good kid.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
You're catching on.
It's never too soon to start.
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, I'm just not that hungry.
NO!
Oh yeah...
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Honey... I was always good.
Cool?
You think it's cool?
Hack the Planet!
...as they snoop onto us.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
I'm gonna hit you!
Dead?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Mm-hmm.
How did you know that?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
Good.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
What? whatwhatwhat?
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Hey, it's me.
What?
Pervert! What are you talking about?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Just one moment.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Don't get angry.
You don't owe me anything.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Why not?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I do.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Okay, out.
I can't sleep.
Like a real sister?
You bet.
What?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
No problem, Sheriff.
Got it Ben.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Dear God.
Be here in a minute.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
No, he's not.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Sure...
You have the wrong feeling.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Have a good time.
What did he look like?
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Yes.
No! Do as I say.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
What did you use before?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar.
Are you really interested?
It feels like you're in France.
It depends on what way you want to go.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
And it ruins everything else.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
When did you first notice this?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Uh-huh.
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Well, sure.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, don't say those words!
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
I almost didn't.
I know it isn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
No.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
No!
Are you?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Yeah.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
I'm sorry.
Jesus...Jesus!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
You've outdone yourself.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Y-yeah.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Yeah?
Isn't that great?
Well, then a third opinion.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Oh, sure.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Hmm!
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Yeah.  Me, too.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Yes, you do recall, right?
Oh, no.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 
...namely a personality.
Really?
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
You're kidding me.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
I am.  You-you made my day.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
When'd you get here?
Tch.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I hereby acknowledge that...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
...the whole world's out to get you...
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Show me the Pigs.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
I won't take much of his time.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
..suitcase...locker...
Let the girl go.
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
How's your <u>child</u>?
Give it up.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
No, I don't get you...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...and that is what you need to expand.
I know where he is.
I want the money.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
...yes, yes, yes....
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
That would be a No.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
Probably.
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Gee, thanks.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
Something like that. Will you do it?
I'll think about it.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
But she couldn't handle it.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
No.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
That's good. Have you done this before?
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Remember he's left-handed.
May<u>be</u>.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
You didn't say Simon Says.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Come on, sit up.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Can I go now?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
gives her a sympathetic look.
looks startled at the outburst.
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
You mean travel by ourselves?
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
All right, then.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
It's inside a moving car.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
I did more then that.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
What?
Gwen.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
What?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
No please make yourself at home.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
This game is over do you hear me?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Read it.  It'll be fine.
Gale...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Dad!
Never reach out!
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
-- hospital.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
Sure.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Just show me the way.
About us.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
And?
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
RUDOLF!
Stop knowing me so well.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Honey, are you okay?
Oh -- great.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Did you lock the garage door?
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
Look, I think we should work things out.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Get on the other side of that.
Would you?
No joke, Lieutenant.
What?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
And Brenda?
You sure?
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
Sing.
Maybe myself.
France.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
It's done.
I stood up first.
Agreed.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
Sometimes.
Who was that man last night?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Is it?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
He will not stop until it is over.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Why?
How could they get by him?
His head.  Someone cut it off.
I know, Paul.
We'll see.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
That's what the Kurgan said.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
I can take care of myself.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
Yes, sir.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
They'll cut the power.
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
Give me an ETA.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Where is it?
You sure?
I know.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Mars?  What are you doing?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Order your men to stand down.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Special Agent Jones.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
We're okay.
What do you want me to do?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Who is it?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
Of course.
There is nothing to it.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Canadian Club?
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
Will you protect us.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Your police are at the gate?
No, sir.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
How so.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
I saw the sign.
Why sir?
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
That will take time.
Call, sir?
Show me your ID
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
The third floor are low class rooms.
He wants your wisdom.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
They know you are Tutsi!
Get in.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
It will do just fine.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
So where is the lamb?
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
Go out! Where?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Why?
I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
That is why they call it coach?
What! Paul storms off.
The staff and guests! How many?
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Where?
Can I help you?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Is she alright?
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
And I think that's case --
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
The...Fourth of July.
And we get this money when?
Prove it how?
No...not air --
It's succeeding!
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Haven't they already?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You know everything you do gets me hot.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
-- no more --
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Believe me, we need to.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Over here.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
I don't know.  That's strange.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Were you fooling with the power?
I don't know what I'm saying.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
I think everything's ready.
She's gone!
Know what?
Maura.
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Oh.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
So where is it?
Where?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
Every day.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Buying some drugs, alright?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
It has already begun.
Really?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yes. 53
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
You sound disappointed.
Why not just go now?
Too-do-loo, babe.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Prison?
I was the Warden?
The C.I. what?  God, no...
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
I got my planet back.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
If you think you're getting past me...
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Too bad.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Snappy.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
I'm happy enough.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
This I know, Benny.
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Yeah, tell me about it.
Ya get the special?
...Her mother needs an operation...
If you say, miss.  If you say.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
I've never heard of a cure.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
But she's not dead, Wes.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
I love Fort Holland.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
Right o'.
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
What?
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
Good.
Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
What?
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Huh?
But what?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Of course.
I used to know how to cook.
Social work?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
I gotta get to English class.
See ya.
Moisture! Moisture!
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Let's see!
Just be careful.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
The Idiot?
What is it?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
I don't know.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Wendy!
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
The ones you built?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
I don't know. How do I know?
Good.
Sure.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Actually...
Don't worry about him...
Who's playing?
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We'll get the other one, though.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
No.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
So?
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
You know what about.
To do nothing.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Will?
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
You don't know.
Who?
Who?
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
But you wanted to.
You're not following procedure.
Your lips, they didn't move.
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
But why?
We want no quarrel with him.
How he must have loved you.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
And if I cut my hair again?
What plans?
We forgive each other then?
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
What danger?
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
NO!!!!!
You have fed. You were made for this...
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Read her thoughts.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
That and more.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
He did it to make you stay with him!
It's over, I'm telling you...
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
And you know what you ask for?
Yes!
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
Then, don't.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Some.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
They never found the body.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Never do that again.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
You know me to well.
You sure?
I'm fine.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
So why are you still here?
You don't have to be a jerk.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
What an odd question!
The General  you don't even know him.
That your father and I 
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Her family name?
You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because I willed it so.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
We have no time for that.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
I shall not leave the island 
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
Everything's so simple. I like you.
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Don't . . . George?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Hiya, George!
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Yes, sir.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
A cattle boat?
All in . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
Yes, sir.
Oh, George.
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
He's pretty young for that job.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
She was here first.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
This way.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
You like it? I'll send you a box.
I'll take chocolate.
Me?
Too young or too old?
Didn't you tell her?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Do you like it?
Yeah, just started.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
What?
Stop paddling!
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
You're betting what you already got.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
The rope!  The rope!
Can you get us a line?
No!  It's still there!
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
What else is there to do?
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
You heard me.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
You said something about a camera.
Did you get any pictures?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
My ass!
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The what?
We don't know that, do we?
So there's one around here.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Good.
It's an island.  Got to run.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Just one minute....
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Did you say Cable Junction?
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
I love it.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Would you take him?
Forget it, he won't listen.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Just put your mask on.
... Friggin' fish.
No, you're not.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
So tell Calvin.
Come on.
So?
I can have them walk backwards.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Afraid I can't do that.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Get ready to go.
Thanks to you.
They still seem nervous.
How you doing, Kelly?
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Take it up.
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Gotta sneeze.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Hey, I don't want to hear.
The world's southern most reaches.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Five hundred yards.
Right, Mike.
So was Dad.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
We're in love.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
That's what grandmas are for.
But you always let me....
No way....
Chicken....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
We need beer....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
Where is she?
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
I'll miss you....
Dad died from a heart attack....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I don't want to talk about that.
Promise me....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
You're impossible....
It's wonderful....
No!
That's hard to imagine....
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
She said it was coming....
You sure you know how to do this.
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Oh, boy....
Will you leave me alone...?
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Put me down....
They put bombs on dolphins....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
Down here....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
So far..
How long have you known Hoagie?
Hoagie.
Half don't...Bring her about....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
Shove it....
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
Who grows more beautiful....
Oh, Jake... 
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
What?
How about any guys on your staff?
You heard. Look for the knife.
I already did. What's his problem?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
So am I. But where's my money?
Car accident.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Hey ..
It's twenty of three.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
No.
My hands?
No.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Ross told me.
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then why didn't he kill me?
Who sought the warrant?
You find something curious in that?
Freddy's new obsession ..
Even better.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
I have to finish my job --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
-- stop --
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
I may not sue.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Oh hell yes.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Let's do it again.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Oh my God.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I think so.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
Not a chance.
Pleasure.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
What'd I say?
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
What?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
What did you say!
I don't remember
How low?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Are you sure?
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
You're right.
I have never been on this island!
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Everyone, keep your voices down!
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
I'm fine... I'm fine...
Come on!
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Oh, God.
You're going too?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No way.
What are they?
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Funded by whom?
What?
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
I believe in him.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
The monitors are failing.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
What one?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Pretty sure.
Oh my God.
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
We were right!
Dilophosaurus.
Not just every six weeks.
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - a gizzard - -
I don't know.
What's that?
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
In a box under my seat.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
You got me.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Amphibian DNA.
Nope.
You have no idea.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
He left us!  He left us!
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Why did you do this?
They don't bother me.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Other guy?
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
His camera... it's still recording.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Uh-huh...
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
How's that possible?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Up there.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
You're detestable.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
Have you looked?
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
He was murdered.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
No, I suppose not.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
Then why haven't I been --
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Orlac is an account?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
What's to become of us now?
Amerika!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
It's ... lovely.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
That's your monkey, Denham.
) They are now.
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
What's compassion, mister.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Here please.
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
My name's John Klute.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Gee.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
-- OK?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Try some other ways. 
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Yeah.
Go down in my room.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Trask wants to talk with you.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
No. I'm sore.
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
Well as a matter of --
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's not so bad.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
Did she talk about him to you?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
We grew up together. Kids.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Trask --
What about your mommy?
What do you like best about your daddy?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Show...
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Yeah?
We use the green and yellow.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I'm allergic to onions.
Like a principal?
What don't you understand, pal?
Sustained.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
And what is your present salary?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
No.
No.
Do you have a lover now?
I suppose...
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Yes, what?
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Right.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Fine.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Oh, no..
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
I'm sure.
Three.  And add some basil.
What d'you tell her?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Soon.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
I pooped.
I miss my brother.
How many?
Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
Roughly five thousand men.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
America, we shall see.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
Please, come in, so cold.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
You decide.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Where is Poland?
We have.
You are unharmed?
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
Thank you.
And what would he do come winter?
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
You talk to Bickerman?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Guess I finally got bit.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
What?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Good.  See ya soon.
I didn't say it like that.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
You calm down!
Yeah.
No.
Seconds.  Three, four.
What kind of backup do we have?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Me too.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Else.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Backstabber?
Why not?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
You're all right! Where is he?
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
You do until six p.m.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Five... so far.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Mmm. And what else...?
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
How long did you live there?
Two months.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Early. Still dark.
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Yes...
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Let's go with it.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Sorry to disappoint you...
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
When? How?
There was no letter.
I sent three men to Webb!
"Some"?
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
We were headed...
Excuse me...
That is sedition! Treason!
We don't.
And if we're unlucky?
Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
For Munro children?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
Yes.
Why Sixpack?
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
What?...
Crunch...Implosion.
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
You screw around like that again and--
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Maybe they already have.
Where's Jones?
All right...
No...she killed herself.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
What music?  There ain't no music.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
Twelve hours!
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
The infirmary?...
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Your pocket?
I still will, if you don't mind.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Where're the others?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Good job, Chris.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
So?
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
So?
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
--you're going to be on your own.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
No, sir--
Because it's a job?
No, sir. Not at all.
And you and Private Graves--
Charley Wade.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
You look good--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
I never met her.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Both.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
You lived in the States for a while?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
Lead mine.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
It's a .45.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Yeah. I bet he would.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
We have a daughter.
'57, 1 believe--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
Charley Wade.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Do you?
And the ten thousand?
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
A little older than Paloma is now.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
Of course you can.
It's Saturday.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Well, you were working there--
Murdered him?
Got him here?
I'll see what's going on.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
More, I hope.
Couple months before I was born--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Yeah.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
What's up?
You sell much out here?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Payne.
You heard right.
I love weird.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Will you come to him on your knees?
You don't?
Harry.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Yes.  You do that.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
What then?
Nothing you don't want.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Yes.
It's okay.
Harry...
I just saw him.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
Fuck you.
It's one in the afternoon.
Probably.
Yeah, I know.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Help me.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
I won't say anything.
What?
Not much.
What?
Well... nobody.
He's better off this way.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
Call me tomorrow.
No.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
Yes! Yes!
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Try twenty-five.
Oh.
What do you do?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No.
No way.
Ok.
No, its easy.
Really?
No, you smiled.
Oh.
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Hi, Bob.
I'll miss you.
Take them.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
That's not what I'm talking about.
What?
Not all that pasta.
Fine.
Oh, come on.
It's Lydia, your wife.
Do you want to- 
Yeah.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Ok.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you have to go?
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
Thank God he did.
Yeah, like...
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
You have to tell me who did it.
No, I wasn't, actually.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
What did you hear?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
Then why are you here?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
What?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
What did he say to you in French?
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
It's Detective Smythe.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
He's looking right at me.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
I can't eat before a game.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Dad around?
Need any help?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's ridiculous.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
He's fine.
Sort of.
Why not?
How'd you get him to say yes?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
You lost your head.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Thanks, Sidra.
But?
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
With a jacked-up attitude.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Yeah.
Quincy...
I've been trying to find you all day.
Are you out of your mind?
Least she had time for me.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Stay!
I never asked you to choose.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Maybe go back to school.
From basketball.
you woke me up to tell me that?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
Yeah.
Quincy, please...
I mean, it's not true, is it?
Lucky kid.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
You ok?
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Uh-huh.
My mother had breast cancer.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
Okey-doke.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
I'm sorry.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Well...is that illegal?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
Yes.
You alone in there?
Claudia What?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
-- no.
That's confidential information, little man.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
I'm a rapper.
Finish it up without the lip.
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
Well --
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Gently, son --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
I need to sit down.
No.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
When was the last time you talked to your son?
I've seen it before.
Is Jack your son?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I think you have the wrong number.
Alright.  Thank you.
Like I said, yeah --
In aid of what?
Mm. Hm.
the valley?
I wouldn'tve asked --
In five years?
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
When did he go off chemo?
I don't think, he can't...
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I AM CALM.
No one else in here?
No.  I said that.
Marcie.
I don't know a loud crash.
No.
No.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
No.
All your other fluzzies?
Yeah. Yes.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Will you say my name?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
Come home soon after the show.
Yeah.
No.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Well maybe.
But you can't say....
I'm Bob.
Saucy-saucy.
No they don't --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Are you on drugs right now?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Shut the fuck up.
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
What would you like?
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
I need this one.
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
Why did you do this?
Go to bed.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
It's not right.
I hate it.
Nothing... Nothing.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
How can I serve you in this?
Soon enough.  Here we are.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Come on...
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
Whose rooms are those?
Who came?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
No, you may wait behind the screen.
Oh Louis, Louis...
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
So what?
What do you think?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Great. Well that changes a lot...
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
I'll live...
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Could explain why Fleming was there.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
Yeah.
Yeah...
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
Let's see what we got...
I knew I could count on you.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Hop in.
Not with this...
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
How much do you know?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
The mark? Yes.
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
What'd it say?
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Don't talk to me!!
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Stay in the trees.
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Let's get to the physical.
I'll see you later. All right?
You'll come by?
It's me.
Who?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
I'm very scared.
In a little while I'll help you understand.
Yeah. It's right here.
No.
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
Where did you get it?!
Three, four hours.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
What happened to them?
No.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Blue is cold.
I remember.
Then why?
Can you quit?
Come home with me.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
You going back down to Florida after?
That's right.
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
I got it. Thank you.
No.
You're insane.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Yes. I'd considered it.
What do you want?
Why does it feel good?
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Tank you veddy much.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
Twenty!
Deal.
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
It's me.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
And you're just poor white trash!
Each show is worse than the next.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
It is apparently not working.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Don't believe everything you hear.
I used to think you were original.
Bob Gorsky.
What?
Oh, God.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
He had an accident.
I need an exit!  Fast!
They'll be able to track it.
He's beginning to believe.
Yes.  Now.
But what if...?
Show me.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
And she's never wrong.
Why?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
I need the main wet-wall.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
What?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I just thought... you were a guy.
What did she tell you?
What choice?
What?
Why?
No, you're not.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Hell yes!
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Because I believe in something.
Duck!
He's alive.
Cypher, I thought --
Nothing's private...
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Wouldn't bother me.
There won't be any this week.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
That's not going to help.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Nope...
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
How much?
He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
You said it.
Chinese food?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
What did he do?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Do you have enough?
Well...
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Don't ask.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Shut up.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
He's coming.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
I know you do, darling.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
We've got some things to discuss.
Who?
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
That's okay, Daddy.
Oh, the goddam party --
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
What 'business'?
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Hot or cold.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
As close as a deal could be.
Olympic.
Is there any more to it?
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
For how long?  And why?
Certainly, Bill.
Are you running this Board or am I?
I know.  Gum up the works.
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
That's what he said.
He said that?
Yes.
Mine, too.
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Rass!
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
As long as it takes.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Come again?
Yes?
I came to see you.
Yes.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Yes...I've found that it does.
Has her pain abated?
Girlfriend?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
For how long?
'Love will find out the way'?
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
I don't understand.
Um -- not right now.
What's okay?
'Fish'?
Well, they're mine now.
And we're very grateful.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
I am not a dream.
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
What?
It's enough now.
Please.  Talk to me --
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
What question?
Good morning, Quince.
Yeah, I give a shit.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
You're not listening --
Aw, you're tough.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Raise away.
Joe?
You don't know anything about Joe --
I don't know, I can't say --
I'm having a helluva time.
Daddy --
Oh, yes --
The fireworks are about to start.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
What's the way?
'Her'.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
Why not?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Thanks.
Why?
It's isolated.
What happened?
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, I hated it.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
What does he want?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Shut the fuck up!
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
Who's your boyfriend?
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Teddy!
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Prove it.
I won't be happy until you leave town.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
You won't remember!
No. You took them out.						  *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Yes you do...
How many?
You do.
When?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Is this the protective male talk?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
Stevens?
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Like...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
We're makin' moves on each other.
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
Chill out Sonny.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
If you're down, we're down for the play.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
To recruit you.
Where's Riccardo?
I don't understand...
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Sure you're all right?
I ain't sleepy.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Whatsa matter now?
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
I'm wet.
Gin's okay.
You want me to leave?
Gonna be like money from home.
... and taxi fare for me.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
History, man, history. How much?
Where?
Twenty months?
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
How's your hernia?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Oh Jesus! 
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Would you recognize him again?
Stupid.
I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
That's a great philosophy.
Who?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Yeah...?
20 minutes.  Susan?
Oh, man, there you go again.
What?
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Depends.  You got a memo?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
You did!
Don't get kinky here...
We?
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
The scent won't last...
Talk to me.
That's it?
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
No shit.
Sure.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
Nothing.
No, what is it?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
...have to wait.
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
To Misery.
Why would you lose me?
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Don't talk to me like that.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Ahh!!!
Four or five days ago. Why?
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
Just from his agent.
That's nice.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
No, the typing kind.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Where is it?
Magic...
I suppose I did.
'Thief in the Night?'
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
What are you talking about?
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
..or hard wired..
I'm not ready!
He's heading down the stairs, now..
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
- right..
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Like what?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
You mean it'll be difficult.
She sacrificed herself..
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I do.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
She must still be on the property.
I told her to get outta there.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodys got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Sleeping's better.
There was nobody on the bridge.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
I didn't say that.
Okay...
Is this the only way?
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
What makes you trust me?
What was your deal with Job?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
Time up.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I thought I'd take some now.
Why not?
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Yeah.
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
I want you to stop seeing her.
No. You were there.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Bed.
Yeah.
I won't come.
Yeah.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
And what did they say?
He's in Palermo.
Maybe I should come back another time.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
You don't have to help me.
How'd he die?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You think so?
Stop it!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
Me neither.
I was dead, too.
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did you do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
What?
I'll come to the wedding.
What are you talking about?
Come on.
You're late!
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
Why?
I'm afraid of who I am.
I was.
Let me go home.
Right.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
What?
Yes?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Alright. A month. In a month.
I have no secrets from my family.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Did you see it?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
You should think about this.
I know.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Yes.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Good.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
Then why are you eating alone?
Yes.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No.
You mean the whole house?
It's a house.
Well. That explains it.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Yes!
Am I right?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
Who are the Britons?
I move for no man.
What?
Had enough?

What?
You got us all worked up.
Charge!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Why do you think she is a witch?
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your name?
To seek the Grail!
And another!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
But I don't like her.
... and you'll come and get him.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Is that clear?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Sir Galahad!!
Oh ... hello ...
Please ... we are doctors.
You got my note!
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Bravely ran away, away.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
You know what I mean.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
I'm getting dressed.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You know nothing about her!
It's a diary.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Mr Brown, sir --
Good man.  And is she all right?
Of course.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mama...
You'll talk when I'm finished!
How will I know?
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Aye, do.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
This is a slur on her good name.
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
This is the top.
Why?
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
You are here safely.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
Aye.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Have I ever let you down before--?
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Mrs Brown.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
A few days, ma'am.
From whom?
What is the matter with him?
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What the hell are you talking about?
It's twelve-thirty!
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
Everything.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
Yes I am...
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
There...
Check your read-out.
So tell me you're okay, then.
In this world, wrong is right!
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What do you mean "you know"?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Sure.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
I understand.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
Are you okay?
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
What?
Yes, there was.
Oh...
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
You don't remember anything else?
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
No.... I don't...
We'll take our check.
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
Yeah, what for?
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Pick with expediency !
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Okay.
Girder, watch your head.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
Because of my charming personality ?
A dragon.
Don't eat at the console.
When I think you're ready.
No.
I just want to double check the facts.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Yes sir.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
I think I'll see hat action.
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
I meant him.
Do you want to go out with me ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
What do you remember about her.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Seriously?
Hi Dad.
She just had a baby that's all.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
No.
You're being narrow-minded.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You mean, you knew about me?
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
oh.
Come on in!
ehh...I don't know I mean....
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
No THANKS!
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
Change my name.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Come and get it.
...I dropped it.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Big deal.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
They're great.
But...are you engaged or something?
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Okay.
Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I'll be here.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Well I'm sort of involved.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Oh no.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
He's so tiny.
O.K.
It's there.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Deceased.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
This is where we are.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
Then who's it for?
Dad??
The money?
Why?
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Feeding my fish.
He was allergic to bees.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Thirty five dollars.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Come here, sit down over here.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
He likes her.
Why?
I am.
Can we look around in your camper?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Aarrggh.
Uh huh, why?
Oh great!!
To chocolate?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Okay, OW!
What's wrong with your eyes?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
No, I don't wanna.
Never mind.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
I am not.
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Really?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Close your eyes.
I should look different.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... weeks.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
Go figure you.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
I love him.
That's entirely understandable.
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Mirrors.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
No.  I've got you.
Me either.
The night we met.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
Well, if that's the way you f...
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
You got a real good memory, Star.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
No.
What?
How did you come in here?
You'll have to speak up.
You bet.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Your job, huh.
You know better than that.
President.
To the bathroom.
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Your brother?
Harvard?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Need a ride?
Do you carry door handles?
Sixty-three.
The car broke down.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Car pool?
I knew when I first met you.
What?
Yes.
Hundreds of times.
Where's Bill?
How long have you been together?
Just a minute.
Hello.
Why?
You go to school together?
No, we never did that
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
He ain't really new.
Southern California.
Ryan O'Neal.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
More or less...
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
What I'd like to do---
Then was it worth it?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Unfortunately, yes.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Take a wild stab!
The entire wing?
Jesus...
Roger, no.
Wayne---
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Wayne Gayle!
When do you want the assembly?
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Lose 'em.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Yeah.
It sure is.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Where's Wilma?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah? That's good.
I'm a teacher.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
That's right.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
You got a problem all right.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Uh-huh. Why?
Go on - hit me!
Yeah.
You will.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
We can always do that, Duff.
What the hell could you do?
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
'Round town.
'Got a good thing, man.
Plannin' on getting married?
What did you say, boy?!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Don't be too hard on him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
Omar, listen to me--
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
You son of a bitch...
What are you talking about?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
I don't have a girl.
Yeah.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
How long, Dixie?
How's the ice?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why would you want me to kill you?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Oh I know.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
I'm late for lab.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Very romantic.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Wings?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Five-- Six--
A--flack jacket.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
OUT!
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
It was a long time ago -
Little known fact.
Better than I...
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Really?
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Thank you.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Do you think you'll find her?
Wow. You believe in me that much--
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Lock.
<i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
I can't help it.
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
He'll die with me!
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
What the hell are you talking about?
No shit.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Oh, Jesse...
Huh?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
Wait and see.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
That was different.
Those are ancient history.
Fuck off.
Thanks, Max.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
Nancy...
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Sounds like a rough time.
That's right.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Your dreams?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Neil, please --
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Now you're lying.
Films mainly.
No thanks.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Bye.
Hi.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Yes.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
No, you were brilliant
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
A bath would be great.
Oh no no -- no.
Cartwright.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Well...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Thank you.  Shall I...
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Yes.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Do you want to stay?
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Still, not sparkling.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Right.
This is Henry James film?
Well, fire away.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Do you ever masturbate?
I think you do, yes.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
She's perfect, perfect.
May I help you, sir?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
You want me to write down all your messages?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Why not?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Oh sure.  Of course.
Bad news.
So?
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am.
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Thank you, ma'am...
Thank you, ma'am.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
So long, kid.
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Sure, Mack...
Yeah!
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What for?
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
No!
Just wait till you hear...
Me. Hit me!
Hold it!
I see.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
'Kay, Mac!
Yeah!
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
What are they?
Yeah...
I don't have any.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
How 'bout twenty?
That!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Of course not.
Because.
What for?
Seriously.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Exactly.
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Who says I don't love him?...
Tell me.
Please.  I need to know.
Well, good.  Good for you.
We were hungry.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
Hi.  Are you... busy?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
What?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Any night.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Mommy, this is Faith.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
He fell out.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
What'd you find?
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Is he looking at us?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Oh.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
A porco?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
Giovanni.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
He missed me.
She's not here.
Mania.
Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
Well, where are they?
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
That's all. Next witness!
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I could have been better!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Hello, Edie.
I can get home all right from here
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Good. So do I.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Oh she's a beauty.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Hit me again, Mac.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
You haven't finished your beer.
I got my whole life to drink.
For not being any help?
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
You?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I know what you want me to do!
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Farm...
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
Let me by.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
But you've got to listen to me.
You go to
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I think you could have.
I'm just resting my feet.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Forty-five bills.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
You ratted on us, Terry.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
In there.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
What do you suppose for?
Without the snake, of course.
I said not as a rule.
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Thank you.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
She just sat there, looking right at me.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Two hours.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
You might not have a choice.
Half for doing what?
I don't ski.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
You'll have to ask him.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
If I could have a little more room.
Of course I am.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
You'd probably tell me.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Yeah...
Who was it answered the phone?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Unless you wanna tell me.
Those guys bother you?
I don't have a problem with it.
Well, does it make sense to you?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
He killed a police officer.
I don't think we should get into that.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
It's a big house.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
I'm not leaving Midge.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn?
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Me?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Thanks.
Here?  In this house?
The State Theater?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
Dad...
I really gotta go.
Huh.
I see that.
You wave back?
I imagine you would've though.
My little girl, the tough babe.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
You mean hiding them?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
You guys are new?
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Yeah.
I didn't mean it.
I was grieving too.
I'm out of fuel!
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Yeah.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
...He said that?
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
What do you get for winning?
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Fook ya dooble!
Stag movies. Smokers.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I can't. It's all too much.
Aren't we a little old for that?
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Yeah. Like that.
Right. I promised my mother.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Just take a look at it. 
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You're going to listen to me.
What?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Are you for real?
What, why?
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
What're you doing here anyway?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
What a treat.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
I'm home now.
What about?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Why not? They're my favorite.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
What do you mean?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
I miss him too...
K-R-O-one.
Andy?
I'm not going to close the--
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
What's that mean?!
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not ready to die.
I have AIDS.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Your... lover?
They sabotaged me.
Thank you.
Uh huh...
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
In some situations.
Yes.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Yes.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
That's correct.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Andy, you don't want this.
Charles...
Charles...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Look deeper.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
You sure you can keep --
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Hey, who?
What?
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
Never said you were a hype, either.
For your own fear.
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Not staying in here another....
Well, you got the big gauge.
Well, what's it look like now?
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
So which one caught your eye?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What's so special about him?
Remembers what?
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
But how long is a day?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
To Earth! That we've landed!
long pause) You know it.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
What?
My name is Taylor.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Sure.	In a cage.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
God bless you.
But perhaps he understood --
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Where are they now?
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Out there man - behind the log.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Sounds like it.
Fuck you Elias.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
What are you talking about! 
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
You don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.

We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I'm sure you have.
I haven't been invited.
Okay. You win.
What did you say his name was?
As I said before...
Much too late.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
There wasn't any plane.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Quarter after one. Why?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
I didn't notice him.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
You leave it.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
We wouldn't have met at all.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Very ridiculous.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
I know that.
Sometimes.
What are your rates?
For five hundred, what do I get?
And without much discrimination.
That comedian?
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Quite sure you had no motive?
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
I don't think you locked your door.
You nasty, sardonic--
Convenient, isn't it?
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I think so.
Warm water, no doubt.
Not quiet yet.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Brandon handled the money envelope.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
So-so.
Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
Of course.
Right.
I say YES!
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Thanks.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Yes.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
I'm not sure I can face it.
Keep me company.
Of course.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Who?
I called you a taxi.
Me too.
Not yet you know any of these people?
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
It's shit.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
I'm not sure.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
What about the Cromwells?
Take a look at these.
No, thanks Dad.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
No.
Caught my first tube this morning.
That's the point, isn't it?
What that?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
They took a left at the next light!
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Tyler, put the gun down.
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Go on.
This gets better by the minute.
What story did you give to Davis?
Anytime.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
It's been a long time, General.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
Yes.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
New York.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
So do day jobs.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Always.
Uh-huh.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Occupational hazard?
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Don't drown.
Five full nights... days too?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Vivian...
Thank you.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
I'm here.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Oooh, I love those.
I leave extras, miss.
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Steak spoon! 
Me?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I think it's great.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
As you wish.
As you wish.
There will never be a need.
Gently!!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
I have a little.
Over the Albino, I think.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
Who gets Humperdinck?
I don't understand.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
It will not happen!
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
I thought he was with you.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
Are you a rotten liar.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I am not left-handed.
Okay.
Inconceivable!
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Yeah, an hour.
Guess what.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Good, what is it?
Well, sir, it seems ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Mr. Bialystock ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
No way out.  No way out.
Always.
Of Siegfried...
Bismark...
Heil you know who!
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
What?
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
What are you talking about?  What is this?
What?
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
A lot?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Just what he told your detective.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Huh?
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
An hour! Or less!
Just wait here?
Where could he have gone?
Yes. I think he would have.
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
This is the old highway.
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Bates.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I haven't even been married once yet!
Sam, let's go get married.
I'm thinking of it.
No.
I'd like to.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
You go out... with friends?
To a private island, like you?
Crane.
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Is there?
I'm sorry.
Please.
Do what?
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
You--a friend to me?
You found Buckley?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
A voice ...
There's no child here.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
You mean he was colored?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
We'll grant that.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Old Howard Winton's cub?
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
You weren't going with her?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
But I have some friends waiting.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
How did the rabbits kill him?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well... maybe...
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
They're discussing it.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
He kissed her.
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Go on, Doctor.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
What?
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
He's a polecat, dear.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
No, sir.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Tennessee?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Galley what?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
I had better call Daddy.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
She's fine, as if you cared.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I'm just saying...
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
Yeah.
Name one.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Oh... okay.
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
Speak for yourself.
There'll be other chances.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
That's not true.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Maybe it's enough.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Keep 'em busy.
Yeah.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
I can't see.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
You love him, don't you?
Lower it!
You, too.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
We shall double our efforts.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh, no.
Tell me.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
Never-r-r!
How many languages do you speak?
Oh...
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
Dealing
That ain't no crime
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I suppose.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
I sold them to you.
It's fine.
It's not that --
No, I don't belong here.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
I gotta go out for a while.
What're we going to do?
You didn't!
Don't talk like that to him!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
You're hurtin', man!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Six!
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
You have my food in ya hand.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
A few bucks.
Do I have to pay juice?
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Did you hear what I said?
What'd you say?
Maybe I like garbage.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Ya, somethin' like that.
...Tomato?
More like thirty.
...Who'd ya fight?
Yeah, sure.
Ya puttin' me on?
How do you mean?
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Let's get outta this stink.
...No.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
You ballin' her?
To see ya train.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you feel you have a chance?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
I'll bet.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
That's what you woke me up for?
So what do you want me to do?
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
My brother.  Get inside.
Good idea.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
He shall be endured
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
I have.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
If my heart's dear love--
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
And I don't believe you...
Who the fuck are you?
And who are you?
What is?
From Interpol?
That's him.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Next.
I take it you still want the money...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Bullshit!
I swear...
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
A means to an end, is that it?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
And you respect him.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
I didn't expect that he would.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Created?
Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
No thanks.
Things.  This is my country, you know.
I can do that.
As in, they own it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I do.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
So is the woman.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...
Gregor's cell phone...
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
A lot of people died.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
You don't have to do this.
Do what?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Closest and oldest.
Finish the job...
Finish it!
I guess that's for the best.
Seamus Reilly.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
Dwayne listen to me -
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Neither do I.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
And you're solid on that?
None of us like it!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
HELLLLLP!!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
What for?
I know.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
I swear to you, it's true...
What did he buy?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Did you say After Midnight?
Is this marked money, or what?
Hmmm...
No, I can't say that I have.
Sure.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Dwayne -
You're never getting that much.
I think I am.
We're gonna talk.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Are you hungry?
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Well I don't know --
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
Is this about the funny money?
This is your ship?
So what's your story?
Lee, you okay?
That's right.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
Bathroom.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
How you doin'?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Not Yu.  You!
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
Why LA?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
Get it out of here!
Take it!
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
MMMMMM!!!!
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
New York City?
A little Mu-shu.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
You must come with me for questioning.
Don't.
Yes, Master.
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Shut up!
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but --
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Don't go there...
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
What?
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
No, fish is a PM food.
No...what?
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Not to me. Never to me.
At this point we don't have much.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Do it!
Can I speak with her?
Han?
It's Griffin.
I still have work to do here.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
You don't understand this guy.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
No.  No, you didn't.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
You're coming here?
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
And you defending her?
Are you a reporter?
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
You know, your daughter seems...
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Done.
Cindy the manicurist.
You afraid to try?
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
That's called changing your mind.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I kissed him back.
A little longer for me.
I love you, too.
Well, you do have the dress.
And the church.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
What happened at the luau?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Thank you, Dad.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
So you're angry.  Big deal.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
It's delicious, trust me.
It was my mother's.
Look!
He lost all the weight... there.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
What?
Thank you.  I love you.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
He said hello.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
It's a sign.
Grace heard it.
It's not that late in Seattle.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
You'll see.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
P.  Dad?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
So I can go.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Everyone at work heard you.
It's a short word.
Who is Annie?
What's wrong with Annie?
You said we could go to New York.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
He's good at it.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
No, no ...
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
Over my dead body.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Like what?
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
No ...
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Yeah.
No, Why?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Ouch.
This man sounds like a real catch.
You don't understand.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
How?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
Please open the door, Danny.
Ass first into the world.
I can't tell you.
Why?
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
What?
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Why's that?
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
That was my idea.
What does that mean?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Hey, I was just trying to ...
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Yeah, dickhead.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
It's not my place.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
When?
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
And what does this have to do with me?
That would be me.
I was talking about Miles.
Tom, quit fucking around.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
Where are your men now?
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
Figured.
The Army gave you that?
They got squirrels there, too, right?
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I guess.
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
You think the rest of us were?
You know classical music?
Did he see any sign of them?
That only leaves three.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
Hell of a mission.
Since when have things been normal?
You're kidding yourself.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
How about you take your position?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
I'll do my best.
You're welcome, John.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Yeah, how so?
I'm listening, sir.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
What are we likely to run into?
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
What about you, Captain?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
And your former wife.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Yeah.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Please?
See you tomorrow.
I am.
I dream about it.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
What is wrong with this girl?
I can accept that.
Alright.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Dad, I'm sorry.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Sit down.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
You're right.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Thank you very much.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Pardon me?
I'll go.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Friends with potential.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
No.
Your letter came yesterday.
We'll see.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
It sounded like you did.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Oh shit.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Uh... okay... um...
How ya doing?  Is she around?
How do you pay for one of those?
So what's up?
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Lloyd.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
What?
I was just going to kind of move around.
We're full on bonded.
He is.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
Yeah, what's that?
These people, my people, I want my people.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
You're not telling me something.
I just told you.
This is not my problem.
Look it up.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
There's nothing in the stores.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
The war could end.
Ah, yes.
You did so much.
Would it do any good?
We're aware of that.
They've broken their pattern.
Don't. Think Bailey.
What is it?
Stop it...
Why aren't you there?
I'm inquisitive.
What?
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
Its over, Cotton.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
No way.
You freakin?
Sid, you don't have to.
I think it's out of your control.
No. This is a set up.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
What guy?
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Until now.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
I see you read the book.
Not good.
Billy had alibis too.
What are we looking for?
C'mon. Let's go.
I don't play games.
Are you in danger now?
Gotta.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
I just love being a sister.
She's not here right now.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I get scared really easy, okay.
He's after me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Did you request this case?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
The killer called her.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Where are you Dewey?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Gale, your engine's still running.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Who is it?
Sure.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
I am Gale Weathers!
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
No really?
Good twist.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Who's this.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
But you know my favorite name?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
I'm sorry, your voice.
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
She looked dead. Still does.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
What's that?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
It's been a year since she died.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Stop it!
I think you have the wrong number.
Do I?
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
You're making popcorn?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
You never told me your name.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What do you think I said?
Gotta go.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Afraid not.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
I like it. It's... sexy.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Hold up a sec...
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
How is everything?
What about the cellular phone bill?
Casey? Casey?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
What's your favorite scary movie?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Uh-huh.
LEAVEMEALONE!
...so call if you need me.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Like you had one.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
It's past seven.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
He's not finished.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
What the hell's going on?
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
I visited your home this morning, after you left.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Delusions of grandeur.
It's close.
Drop it.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
What about sports?
What about them?
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Punishing.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
The fingerprints.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
It's not what you think it is.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I... I don't understand.
What?
I want to have children.  It's just...
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Just keep goin'...
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Sir?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
I've come now...
You've done a lot of growin'...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Why?
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Forget it...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
What's goin' on?
It's what I'm countin' on.
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Where?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
We should leave the past alone.
And the title of this piece?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
Wait!  Will you desist!
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Put his feet in.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
How?
She is always Aphrodite.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
A different one you haven't written?
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Stand up straight, girl.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
I like her.
You have opened the playhouses?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Will Shakespeare!
There is.
Mr. Henslowe?
There is time. It is still dark.
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You lie.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
I do not love you, my lord.
My hat?
I . . .
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
It is only ours you can know.
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
That dog!
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
What?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
About what?
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Can we talk about something?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
How much?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Cover it?
Well?
This is just an informal discussion.
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Yes.
Yes.
Just serve.
Know and love?
You're right.
Yes.
What? What's wrong?
What's he doing here?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
David?
Oh, good.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
What?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
did you hear anything before he cries?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
That wasn't a question.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.
No one.
And you need your sleep.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
Yes, sir.
You get the job done.
What's it about?
Writing seems easy.
It's a breeze.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
That sounds fine.
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
Diseases.
Then what's the problem?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That you were just indulging me.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
I know.
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
Nummers.
What?
What're you doing later?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
I hope she's all right.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Well she...
And who's Jill?
Uh-uh.
Are you?
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Did you hear me?
Then what do you think?
Wonderful woman.
Right.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Yeah... I mean great.
Yeah... wow.
Why not?
Yeah, baby...
I don't want to... I swear...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
Lester's on his way.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
No --
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- you know better...
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Here in the canyon.
What's gonna happen?
Well, like what?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Who?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Of course I like children.
George?
George.
Television or movies?
Bullshit.
Well that's something.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
That's all you've got to say?
I see.
In a way. But...
Thank you.
When?
I know what you mean.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
I know it, I know it.
-- yeah?
Now wait a minute...
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Didn't they tell you?
Why, why do you think that is?
I know.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Yeah.
No you won't.
I was too old.
Sid.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Why not?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Does she know about us?
You know what's wrong.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
See you later.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- He reached up and tore them.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Let's do that.
You're going?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
That's fine --
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Thanks for coming by.
Where to, Les?
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Yes, Dad.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
All right.
Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Do I have to?
Yes, I'd like you to.
Grady... oh.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Pleasure to meet you.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Hmm, nice.
Good.
Yes.
Wendy...
Yes?
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
Hi.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
How do you do?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Blue. This blue.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
For getting a divorce?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
No.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
I think they hear you!
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You know it.
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
You bastard!
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Sure.
Good evening, Vincent.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
Chops?
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
That man -- who is he?
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
Wet behind the ears.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
What?
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
She won't?  Why not?
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
I see.
And all those like you.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Would you like that?
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
Until sundown.
My what?
Your cell is more than adequate.
What's wrong with my life?
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
What?
What?
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
You saved my life.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
Really.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
What's the problem?
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
However, we can also pray for other things.
It's better than springtime.
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
What is that?
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
What of it?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
And now Jonathan Masbath.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
How could he?
Look again.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
Listen.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
In test... what?
What does it mean?
Baltus Van Tassel.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
I doubt that's the end.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
There is no such thing as magic.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
Must I hear this?
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
What has happened?
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Use caution.
What... ?
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
She is guilty.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
I like them french-fried potaters.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Well, I guess it's all good.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
What?
Please Doyle, don't.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
How do you know?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Why did he do that, reckon.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A boy or girl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I never was no good with history.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
My history.
I'll be.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
What brings you back?
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
What about me?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
No thank you.
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
And what are you, his chaperone?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
Hi, Auggie.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Yeah, probably.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
Five thousand bucks.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Not a one.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
I owe you something.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
The end.
You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
Yeah, I picked it up.
Good thinking.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Why not?
It seems human.  To me.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
I have told the truth.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
And her farmhouse...?
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
I can't speak for him.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Yes.  And that one, too.
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
With you.
With me?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
Me?  After Sugar?
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
With ME?
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Like what?
Shut up and keep packing.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
Yeah - lets shove off.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
I'm Sugar Cane.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
That's ridiculous.
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
I know where to get some.  Don't move.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
No fair guessing.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Oh yes, we do!
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
- and you got to be girls.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Why?
This is where I get off.
I don't care.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
And you'll be in all evening?
It's not the backs that worry me.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Bingo?
That so?
Yeah.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Want to switch berths with me?
Saxophone player?
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
What makes you so sure?
You're not hurt, are you?
Why?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
You're society girls?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
You mean - like frigid?
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Me?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
Yes, sir.
I already told you.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Oh, dont be that way.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Why?
I do?
A wedding.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
What?!
Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
You knew?
Meet Nick.
Hard.
Will do.
Let me see it...
Sure--
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Yes, sir...
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Hi, Daddy...
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Yes, David...
David!
Act like one!
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Good night...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes, ma'm...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
I'm used to it.
Whatcha wanta order?
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
I am the clitoris.
Montana.
About what?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
AGAGAH!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Oh no, it's that kid.
What?
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Aw, ma!!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
What's the password?
It's okay, I am done for.
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
How do we do that?
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Okay...
Wow!
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
You would know, dummy.
Canada is saving us!!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey, come here, guy.
I am.
Hey, relax guy!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Yup.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Check.
They're not going to make it!
I'm sure I will.
Very professional of you.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
What is the condition of the bridge?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Will you transmit the distress signal?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
That's me.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
That is one of my priorities.
He's in the bathroom.
The engines!
Mac.  What's shaking?
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
No kiddin'.
- canker sore.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
She's my mom.
I got a right. You're my father.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I gotta survive.
No...
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Cool!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Buzz Fazeli.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
You know who I am?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Bowling "Center"!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
He's my father, Millie.
He's no father to you.
Coming right up.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Why were you suspended?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You should.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You're really pissing me off.
Fuck plan C!
I'm looking for somebody.
Fletcher!  Now!
Wait a minute --
Yeah.  I heard you.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Fifty yards and closing.
Forty yards.
But you've tested it?
Norman, don't do it!
Nothing else.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
Jerry?
Working on it now, sir.
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
She's not gonna know, sir.
She wired this system.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
What is it?
To what?
What?
Beth --
You told him about me?
You did, didn't you?
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Antibiotic.
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
What do you mean, different?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Did you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
No, he can't.
Shut up, Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
How's that?
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
What?
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Where's it coming from?
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
So what?
What are you still doing here?
That far in what, Harry?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Harry?
Norman, where are you?
Beth left?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Shut up and open the door.
What does Norman already know?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Think about it.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
What report?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean you don't know?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Not bad.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Could I learn to feel it?
He's bluffing...
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
You rich kids... are all the same !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
You got it bad.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Only when I give you an order.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
I have good reflexes.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
You two have so much in common.
I can't help it.
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Should I be ?
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
I won't quit !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Aw, don't get mushy.
You can never be sure.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Not a problem.
Yes, sir.
Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
They have repressed the Creator.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
You are what...?
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Any reply from them?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
He have any special dietary requirements...?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
You haven't heard of it.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I live there.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Mmm.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I <u>can</u>?
About <u>conflict</u>...
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
What?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
You have to sign for it.
I don't drink.
Then I'll come back, then.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Yes.
...yes.
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
That's something a man could do...?
Now you're talking...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Go you Huskies...
That's right...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
I'm sorry.
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
...why am I here...?
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
They think it's your First Wife...
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says <u>here</u>...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
It's...
I'm having dinner with W...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
There's other things to be learned.
What's his name?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
She's absolutely r...
I, actually yes.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Will you help me out...?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I can't do it, Walt.
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
I know that...
I...I...
...wants a piece...
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
Bob are you alright...?
I'll put the, in your r...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
She won't stop crying...
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
He told you that...
Okay...
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I know you do.
Why?
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
I...
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...not at all...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Givvem a cigarette...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
What are you gonna talk about?
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'll miss you so much.
Good.  That's very good.
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Where are you, anyway?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Oh.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
Have you still never told him?
Remarried.  There is no move.
Me too.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Don't do this.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
Fine, forget it.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
She was angry at herself.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
Luke.  Can't live like that.
How the hell would you know?
Ironic, huh?
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Thanks, but it's under control.
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Double.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
What do I have that you don't?
You're the hip and fresh.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
It's no biggie.
Well, they will be.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
What?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Thank you.
Nice to have you here.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Four brothers and five sisters.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
I did not go to high school.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Is everything OK?
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
The same. Same as what?
Just the same.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
OK. Bye.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
He did?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
What's that supposed to mean?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
I guess not Cooper...
It's nothing to worry about.
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
Yes, you should.
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
See!  See, I told you.
What?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
What did you say, sir?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Peace on earth.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Admiral Buldike?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
They're coming in now.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
I don't think so.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Speed?
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
I think they mean business.
Yeah?
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
No kidding.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Primary trigger switch.
Everything still checks out okay.
He's dead.
What happened?
I said that's the point!
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Are you sure?
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Roger.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
I don't anymore.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Yes.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Yeah.
The dude wants it.
No, no.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, no.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
What she doin' in the van, man?
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Come on.
Hey.
Shit.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Please.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Yeah.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
No, not really. Middle-class.
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What about me? I don't have a car.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Mm-mm.
He's drunk.
Uh-huh.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Nobody. Sooze.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
No.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
That chick, Erica?
I hit her.
You lied to me.
I don't know.
Just put it down.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Nazeer what?
Look, look, just get off my property.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Yes, I stand for -
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Mm-hm.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Oh, yeah?
For a ride.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Now?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
That was so great!
I can't believe you're still here.
No, I'm going.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About what?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
It's none of my business?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
My what?
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
In a deep freeze.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
Well....
Phillip, you're mad!
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
You did?
You sure have.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
What about all those ideas you had?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
If you please.
Why did she call me?
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Or teach it a better tune.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Who else ?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I don't know.
I'll take care of that.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.

The other guests?
Cut out that us business.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
When did he say it, Norma?
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
The doctor suggested it.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
Right with you.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
You made her a star?
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But what will happen?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
It's for your own protection.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
We're from different worlds.
Terrific.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
Like turning off a light.
Miss what?
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I could force you.
Yeah.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
The scoop of the year!
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I could teach you a thing or two now.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
That's home.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
But it's impossible.
Then come with me.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Yes, mustn't stop.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Mr. Roebush?
What? What did you tell me?
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
It sure is.
I didn't --
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Yeah.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
What about this week's check?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
When?
Just the man I wanted to see!
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Tell me more...
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Thank ...you.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
He can have mine. Anytime.
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Never closed my eyes.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
What??
It's beautiful.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Yes.
Now This I want to hear.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Where?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
I'm sorry to see you go.
Politely?
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Our other dinner guest.
It always is with Clark.
A toupee that flies?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
What?
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Not really, no.
Huh?
Big night coming up?
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Come again?
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're just jealous.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Folks'll ask question.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
I guess I got carried away
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
It must feel great.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Pink.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I gave him this new face.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
Maybe I should get help.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
She's in trouble?
It turns to steaming piss.
I will.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Why are you telling me this?
Okay.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Can't you make it later?
Your kids never cry.
Sure.
Just like we look forward to this.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
What do you mean?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
That's right.
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Why would he be frightened?
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Did he say what about?
It's like a song.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Should I keep reading?
I don't want you to lie.
Why?
No.
Tell me about it.
Perfect.
Yes.
What is it?
You've been retained?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Why not?
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
You mean it?
Nothing.
As opposed to this T.V.?
There's talk of that.
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Hitler!
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
I only had a few hours.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
No...
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Are you finished?
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
Yeah!
Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Those lying motherfuckers!
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
What?
Why him?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Eating is eating... and...
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Colonel. Pleasure.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
And your father was executed.
No. Ours was damaged.
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
Of course.
I can't do this. It's not right.
What's not right?
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
It's the truth.
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
How?
And what was that?
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
They said I was dogged?
Like this bandleader.
Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwngler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
I hate the beige one.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Why?
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
You must have had a fun child-
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
No.  Never.
Kyle...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
I'll be right with you.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Oh.  FIne.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Yes... well...
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Can we talk?
Come here...
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
What's wrong?
Nicholas...
God, wake up, it's a con!
Get out of my car!
Then, what good are you?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Scams, con games.  How many?
You call them...
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Nicholas...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Originally, Connecticut.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Will you?
I'll call them, okay?
I know...
What's this all about, Connie?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Yeah.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
Humor me with specifics.
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
It was a different floor then...
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
Not much, I think.
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Well, I... uh...
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
Why?
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
No.
All night?
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
I, I just can't...
What happened after you smelled it?
Yes.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
It was.
Nell.  You will come here now.
That?  That's Hill House.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why'd she kill herself?
No.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Well?
Red.  What else?
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Okay.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
Our black friends?
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Snuffed her.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
One thing I need.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Not her brand.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
It's been a while.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Here, are you always this sarky?
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Black market during the war.
How far?
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
Yeah, I guess you are.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Of the deal, man.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
And that is?
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
That don't mean nothin'.
Lemme break.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
What do you think?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
No trouble.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Ann. Will you come in?
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Ann--
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Hello, Tony.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Right! Strictly business.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
Mm.
OK.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
...OK.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...who among us is in a position to say...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Uh-huh.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Uh-huh.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
...Nah.
Uh-huh.
My *wife*?
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
They sent us to tell ya.
I'm in.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Calm down.  I found it!
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Mind if I have a look?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Apparently it's huge.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Everybody.  Get behind me.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
I'd say we're in its home.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
What are they?
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
What do you do?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
Big as a house.
He's right.  Follow me.
But at what a price.
What?
Frock's been fired.
What kind of hormones?
How about lunch?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
You were going to be married.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
I don't know.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Gone.
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
All prop cars accounted for?
It's just a matter of time.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
--You never had a camera in my head.
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
Why not?
So when are you leaving?
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Nursery?
Trust me.
I can't tonight.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
How about them?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
How do you know?
Good night, Mother.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
There's been an accident, Truman.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
Were you there--how do you know?
You can count on it.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Agent Mulder.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
You got some kind of business with him?
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
I've been using you?!
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
You're looking for a bomb.
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
I'm in the vending room.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
I was until about an hour ago.
According to this tag.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
How was it contracted?
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
I don't know, Mulder.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
This virus -- it... 
Come on!
I don't know.
Just like that --
Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
I've got to find Scully.
I have answers for you.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
How?
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why did we stop?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Then what is he?
Tell me.
Already there.
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
I think that's the whole point.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
No.
I doubt that.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Ja, ja, ja.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
No, no...oh...excuse me.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
In German?
Well you read this.
What are you going to do?
I saw him today.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Where's Harry?
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
I don't want it.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
No, I don't know...
I'll look it up for you.
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
And - Anna...
As long as they can use you?
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Coffee.
The Roumanian?
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Yes, sir.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I am not a bad man.
What else?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not necessarily.
Never.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Just five dollars, please.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Here.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Why?
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
Incredible.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Uh-huh.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
What's he care about?
Oh, really?
Then how come you're talking to me?
He's at a home out here.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
And be crushed.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?!!?
What'd you say?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
A forty-five.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
You do it on the inside....
No!
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Steve's going to explain it.
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
The mother.
Why? Why would she?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Four. But no one this important.
I can tell....
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Do I give a shit?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Just a little... What's the difference?
They're not that Jewish.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Yes.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
I think I'll have a coffee.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
No.
Yes...
Enzo!
Checking out the competition.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Noireuter.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Well... about everything.
... I'm listening.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Thank you...
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Yes... It's magic.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Why is he doing this?
Then, goodbye.
What's your first move?
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
What do you want me to do?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
I don't know.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
Why?
We're old friends.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
Some other time.
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
I got into a little crap game.
What! You can't be --
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Have you got a pen?
I... If you dont mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
Dont you believe in simplicity?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
What do you suggest?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
You wouldnt understand.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
By your Austrian?
Im sure Ill find a way.
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
May I have your phone number?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
What...?
Whats the Ambassador?
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
Good.
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
We conclude our transaction.
Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished?  Theres a 500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Clients come and go.
Maybe I dont.
Yeah.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Fine...
Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Cinq cents.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Then why dont you reach him?
The acid bath?
That's a good idea, sire.
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
They've started the battle without me!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
I'm staying, Jean.
Sound the retreat...
No...
I don't know...
I leave the answer to God.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
Yes, probably... maybe...
Yes, but...
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
The English??
Not unless you hear my confession.
Last night.
What did it tell you?
He's feeling wonderful.
Thanks be to God.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
So how would you put it?
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
Supposing she's an assassin?
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
Noooo!
If there was, I didn't see it...
Yes.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
20,000 gold crowns.
Yes... they were.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Yes.  We can pray.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
No... not like this...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I... I never lied!
What do you mean, they won't come?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Do you think this cross will protect you?
No, I...
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
What... does he... look like?
Why did she have to die?
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
It's nothing.
What are you doing?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What, I'm working, what?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Funny time to say this.
What?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
You'll be deported.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are always notices going up.
Toilets?
Can you help? I've no money...
Bitch!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Sorry, I don't remember.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Watch your feet!
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
No, it was a table.
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
No, not words.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Everyone has to practice.
It must come.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Naw, it's okay.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
You got a bag or somethin?
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
If that's the way you want it.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
All he's gotta do is read.
Why?
Then you'll do it?
If we ever get to it.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
He cheats.
What do you mean?
I am after this race.
You got a system, Carver?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Let me talk to him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
He was?
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
He's just around the corner.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Another young man.
It's the same one.
You've got to get your mind off this.
Go!
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Dorothy!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
Probably not.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Yes.
Why... in the heart.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
He's been dead for three months.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
What would your mother say to that?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
That woman!
Gilbert!
I'm asking you.
Who's is it?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
I think we're on the right track.
This is enough for me.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
I know.
All right.  All right.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Never mind.
Well, let me do that for you.
No.
You don't say --
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
Santa Claus.
No thanks.
Well, didn't you?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
The suspects!  They won't come.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
Police!
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.  Nick!
Yes.
Y-yes.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Oh, God.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
We can't just go off and--
Picks up again just on the other side.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Then step aside.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I got that...sir.
Mine.  Land mine!
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Just relax.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Something like that.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
We'll find our way.
You still got a map on you?
I don't want to die.
No!
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
How do we do that?
Yeah.
Thanks.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
How the hell should I know?
The photos.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
People are suffering.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct.
Too low.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
AH UGH.
No one can see us now we're alone.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
What?
Look!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Look more closely.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
`Til we get a better lead.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Don't touch that.
Stay to your left.
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Alex, please.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Maybe she knows your old man.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Insurance?
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Report on the case so far.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Yes, M'sieu Laval!
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No!
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
And harems ... ?
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
Gaston!
But it's not enough!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Lily!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's what you need!
No. What is it? Tell me.
As you like. 
Beautiful specimen.
You think that's too much?
That sounds sensible. 
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Precisely.
Like that?
But I don't want to be a lady.
And you expect me to believe that?
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Yes, Madame Colet?
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
I know!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Naturally not!
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
But you saw it here.
Don't you mean work me?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
She knows.
What do I tell your mother?
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
I've got you. I won't let go.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
This is crazy.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
I'll wait here.
Right.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
That's enough.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Glad to see you again.
We'll save you a place at our table.
I think you do.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
We'll be expecting you.
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
I'll say she is!
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
No, sir?
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Partners, ain't we?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
I'm sorry to hear that.
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
Sure.
Send that.
What?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Never mind.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
What do you mean?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
So what?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What for?
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Hey--you! Where you going?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Excuse me?
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
I was kidding about that.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Better.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Ignore her?
No...
So what does he want?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
What?
How is he?
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
You get lonely?
No really, I can stay a while.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
But this time they'll be ready.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Jack...
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Wyatt...
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
I appreciate your time -
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Have we met?
What?
He was my father's best friend!
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
What do you make of all this?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
It's Bond!
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
I ought to break your damn neck.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
I'll be right there.
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
That's nice.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
Don't shout!
I was just trying to make conversation.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Woody!  Buzz!
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Yes, I can.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Well, then let's climb abroad.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
The match!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Not today!
She's sick!
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Last present!
Right here, Woody!
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
There's no mirror.
Excuse me.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Is that all?
I'm cold.
Nothing is left but us.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Arnie, this is crazy.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Hi.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
How long's the job?
You can't make me.
Sixteen
I get A's.  All A's.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
I feel good.
Who do you work for?
When will you do it?
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
You're breaking my heart.
We aren't barbarians.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
I don't believe you.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
What?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
An informant.
It was an anonymous tip.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
I'd fucking kill you.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
No, not holding hands.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Can I see you again?
You're too young.
What happened?
No.
No.
Aye.
Try this.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
Running time?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What about The Untouchables?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
How long is it?
Six weeks!
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
With a starship!
It could. Yes.
He doubts me.
But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
But the shuttle-
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
It's all I have.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
If you think it would help.
How do you know?
Is what possible?
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.

"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
No. I will not.
Why not?
I don't understand...
Are you embezzling?
I want to go to his place.
You call that getting over it?
For being on to Dillinger.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
Well, isn't it -- ?
It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
You're getting out of the business?
But-what if I can't...?
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
I'm shocked.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
You're kidding.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
In her dreams.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Stay on him.
She's having an affair.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
You know about that?
Uh, yes, it is important.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Oral hygiene?
What'd you do, honey?
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
Why?
Yes.
Louder please.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
God, you have great legs.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
He said he was an American agent.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
You'll call me then?
I don't know.  I have to think...
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
Yes.
Don't eat anything.
The letter he sent.
Get it.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Want some Goobers?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
I took a cab.
What's your favorite movie star?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
You mean she got a bad batch?
My pimp.
Is he nice?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
What?
Write down Drexl's address.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
How come?
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
I certainly hope so.
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Is he big league?
What's to think about?
Let me handle this.
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
No. No you're not.
No. Not yet.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Why does he trust you?
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
What?
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
They didn't tell me.
Step inside.
Where'd you come from?
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You're no longer an extra -
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
That's bullshit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
What can I do?
Just put it in your purse.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Do you live here?
You're right. It is.
Where's that?
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
What's she doing?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I have to go.
Hiding?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
And I was in it?  What did I do?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
I'll be right here...just in case.
What?  What did you say?
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Hundred and eight already.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
He's up at the Look Out.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
So?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
That a fact?
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Least you can leave.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Like you.
I have ideas.
Such as?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Funny thing.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I'll get it.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
It's . . . it's locked.
Someone will find me.
I'm a solid man.
What brings you to Sierra?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Just ran into a little trouble.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I do.
You're talking like a mad man.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Make it twenty.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You know what I mean.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Not from where I stand.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
They're not very imaginative?
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
What happened?
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
I don't understand what the--
Sure, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I didn't do anything.
No!
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Grace, tell him.
Yeah...
That's a solid name.
Wait a second--
You're talking like a madman.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
You're too quick for me.
Will you shut up!
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
Two-hundred.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
It's Grace.
Accident.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Beautiful?
I have an idea.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
You love him?
No.
Walk away.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I'm not coming back.
Anywhere?
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
But we all need that too. Hold him.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Oh?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Oh.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
You use your sleeve.
Yes.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Think carefully?
What about the game?
That counts.
Seventy-five percent.
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'll help you.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
Okay.
Was your family traveling with you?
No.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Oh yeah.
He admit it?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Oh.
Well, how about it?
About what?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yeah?
Well, she...
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
How far kin you see?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Did I what?
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Just like that?
What was the money for?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
There's more.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
Just forget about it.
They just said they wanted time.
A glass of water would be nice.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
I don't know. This is bad.
County. I was in for fraud.
You okay?
Well, I'm sorry.
Fenster and Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Maybe more.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Waste of time.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
He loved her.
What lawyer?
Right.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
I don't know what you're talking about.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
You think he's..?
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
I was her doctor.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
Neurology?
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
I...yes.
I do.  Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
... that's all right.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
Yes...I...yes.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
You're going to settle out of court?
Do you know who her doctors were?
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
No.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Who are you protecting, then?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
I'm sure you would.
That's perfectly all right.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Yes.  Price...
Yes.  It was, actually.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Is this a bad time.
I've got to work.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Yes.
And what makes you so tough?
Stop pressuring me...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Yeah.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... I understand ...
Hi.  How are you doing?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
What happened in those three...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
No, I'm all right.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Did she hurt herself?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
You won't have to.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Salina, Kansas!
Then will you for me?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
No, it's all right.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
What are you going to do?
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Why?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Only silence. It's always like this.
No.
Where?
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Home?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
No!
No, never!
No... we're together...
Let me go.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
What do you mean?
Three whole weeks.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
And she died...
Out!
Bye-bye!
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Wandering.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By whom?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
I have plenty of friends.
You want to hear me out?
What do you think you are doing?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Just stop.
I'm calling the police.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
We've already done this.
I am not flexible on this.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
What?
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
What.
Well, oh...
The groom?
That's right.
That's right.
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Well, I didn't mean it.
I can't.
Nobody knows.
Good God...Good God...
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Not a prayer.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
I never heard that.
Moore?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
They need leadership.
You said nobody would miss her.
Give me the Valium.
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
How do you figure?
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Why? What's his problem?
Of course.
Okay.
So what do we do?
Do you love me?
Maybe.
I will.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
Well you should.
Yeah. Nesting.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
What money?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
He's your brother.
Buzzing?
The wahoo moment?
I got to agree with that.
I have no idea.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
I guess.
Okay great. What will that be?
"You Send Me."
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
Take your time. I wish I had.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Only because you want it.
How could anybody behave like that?
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Don't go!
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
Yes.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Leave him alone.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
What's he called?
You cannot leave ...
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
All right, Mother.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Got it.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
Enough to level an entire city block.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
I'M WHAT?!
He hears...everything.
As a matter of fact, I do.
I haven't been working on anything.
It feels so.. .real.
How do you kill it?
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Glad to...
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
How did you get your hand out?
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid?
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Indeed it is.
Come on.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
It won't hold.
I'm working on it.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Anything at the Airport?
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>So</u> forth...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
Gloria -- sell the House.  
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Whaddaya think?
Who're you working for?
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
I saw it on TV.
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
Where is he now?
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Keep Talking....
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
You like it?
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
Why a beret?
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Cause the beans, y'know, y'can tell if they're <u>puttin</u> stuff in it.
...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
The FAA announcement.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
We are?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
So what firm you with, pal?
Jackson, Steinem...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Excuse me sir.
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
...I can't make it tonight.
You could have a great beach house for that.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Old values. Buy.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
It's over you, Gordon.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Businessman?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Allow me sir
Have a nice day  sir
Vell.  Goodnight.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Who's is all this?
Right.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Why?
A ghost?
What do you think I should do?
Nope.
You were in an accident?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
The wives.
She isn't here.
I don't know.
I have to go.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Thank you.
No.  No, I don't.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
Stop.
You got it.
Telling you...
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I know.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
We did.
I know.
After that.
Hurry...
Is it gone?
No, no.  It's fine.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
What kind of whispering?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Well, that's nice.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's a ghost.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
We had a seance.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
How did you--
Sweetheart--
The...
Oh God...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
Who?
Claire...
I don't believe you.
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Who is this...?
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
There are things I have to know!
Eighty million doll --- ?
Stop it!
He just went out like & light-
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
Always loved you..
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
It's too soon to know.
I don't know what you are!!!
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
The one time I want it to work...
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Mad. for each other.
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
Hello..
Their what...?
Dropped it.
Mm-hmmm...
I love you too.
That's cause we're below sea level.
Talking to me dear...?
- we made a fire.
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
You bastard!
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
No - not all the time - I mean
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Yes, one and a half please.
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
Why not? Please - it would help me
Did you?
Then make it stop...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
I am sorry...
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
WAIT FOR WHAT!?
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
I better go, Dad.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
We miss our family.
It's my private business! Mine!
I'm getting so good at this.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Just a formality.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
That's a crappy thing to say.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Whatever.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
He's on the move?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I'm very aural.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Come on.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
You're sure?
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
I was like a different person tonight.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Bad news.
And where might that be?
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
No.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
You could tell me where you were last night.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I net a guy in a bar.
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
You have someplace to be?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Ray, you heard him...
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
Where's this coming from?
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You didn't cuff her?
I wanna go home now.
I said he did.
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
Nothing.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
Sam!  Hi!
Where, the mall?
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Forget it.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Sit down, Lombardo.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
I'm going to hit you.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Thank you.
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Thank you.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
But it only has six legs.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
I deal with some tough customers.
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
It's a smelting retort.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
Yes...?
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
No.  I mean yes.
Good.  How long will it take?
Miserable Pecks.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Absolutely!
Nursemaid?!
Time to leave.
Elora Danan!
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
His will.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Why not?
Milking?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
What are you going to do?
So one of them got to him.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
You couldn't wait until morning?
No, no doctor...
But 
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
What else can you do?
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
Here. Whenever you want them.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I don't know where he is.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
My son is out there!
They are English. They don't understand.
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Yes.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Is morally, ethic'ly
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Oh ....
Who are you?
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Goodbye, folks!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Uh-huh.
No --
Oh --!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
You've had plenty of time already!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
But why?  Why?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
To Oz!
What?
The other side....
Yes --- there.
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Yeah. Me?
Now...
You don't neither --
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Quiet!
We do.
To Oz?
A heart --
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Yes.
So who are you?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Who?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
Shell get over it.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
You can drop the act, its over.
I dont know what youre talking about!
You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
You, of course. I need some information.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
Whats your business with Elektra King?
And the payoff on the tables?
No!  Get me out!
Istanbul.
Marvellous.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Washington?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
She's with me.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Old?
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Okay!
Yes you are.
Where did he go?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
-- What?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I don't know their real names!
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
You ain't seen nothing yet.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
But programmable. And expendable.
That's exactly why we need them.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Like what?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Go to hell.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Aren't you afraid?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Is this what you're looking for?
Been to any good diners lately?
This is a gift. From me to you.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
What are you talking about?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
What if they're naughty?
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
No!
Yes, sir.
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
Very....very!
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
All right then!
Good.
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
I wonder what's got into them?
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Could be raining!
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes, Master!
How do you know it was a 'he'?
Maybe...if you get here on time.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What???
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Yes!
I think you've done it, master.
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
But, after all, you have yours.
Do Something!  Stall them!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
