You're sweet.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
They do not!
Joey.
I did.
Queen Harry?
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I just wanted --
What if she never starts dating?
Exactly my point
It's just a party. Daddy.
Because she'll scare them away.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
It's a lung cancer issue
Dead at forty-one.
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
It's off. The whole thing.
Not at all
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
Are you lost?
We don't chat.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
He always look so
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
I didn't have a choice.
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
Why?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
No, you weren't
Why'd you lie?
The duck?
No one else knows
Go to the prom with me
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
You tell me.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I didn't care about the money.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Oh yeah.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Touch of the flu.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Make anyone cry today?
But -- who -- what --?
Absolutely not.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
That's something you can't decide.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
This time with me!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We don't need to know.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Twenty eight.
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
No.  No way.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Give me another one, please.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
When?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Hmmmm.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Alright.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
You promise?
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Get down on your knees.
Where's Czech girl?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
I want to document my trip to America.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Does it hurt?
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Good idea!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Ha. Ha.
We started over, you can too.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Oh yeah, why?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes, I thought so.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
No.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
How is gregor?
Well, that does sound very odd.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Opening pod bay doors.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Goodbye.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
I got a lot to protect.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah, I read the report...
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I still don't think it's loaded.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
What do you want?
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Napoleon... small.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
I didn't know your size.
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Vito Cornelius?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
To save the world.
I'm not going.
What is... Make Love?
Which one?
Apipoussan?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Have you identified it?
How much time is left?
Wait or act.
How's our deal coming along?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
What?
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What are you talking about?
Dino...
And they are?
Right here.
Where are the women?
I remember him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Move it, dirtbag... !
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
It was a lot of fucking money.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
My condolences.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Just curious.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
No.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
You told me to look, so I looked.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
Yes.
Okay.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Yes.  I remember her.
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
No, sir, he is not.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay.  Fine.
Certainly, sir.
I know.
Kristen's story really got to her.
You just feel sorry for me.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Nice neighborhood.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
What?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You disappointed in me?
But Dad --
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Thirty-four seconds!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Minus three.
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Yeah. I know about that.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Deers have ears too.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Something bugging you?
On what you pay me?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
Yeah.
Said what?
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You knew me as a kid.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
This town sucks.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Bang!
Who?
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Not particularly.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
Yeah, no duh.
Jim... for godsake!
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Roger.
Ga get it.
Dead.
Nine.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Stand by.
What do you want with us?
Jim...
Three...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
I wish it were that easy...
Excuse me?
White House Situation room.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
This is the President.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
That's my job.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I just wish it was that simple.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Felt like a large asteroid.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Let me by, Elaine.
Elaine, we have to go back.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Simon, what are you saying?!
That's not possible.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Certainly.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Uh-huh.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Oh, I'd love to.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Would you go up, please?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
I like my horizons narrow.
Show me.
Do it!
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Your mother mates out of season.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Thank you.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
The human?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
Bullshit!
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Yes, Hicks?
What's the question?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Poor bastard.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Fuck you.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Uh, what's next?
Just get back here!
Seal the door.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
No.. I've slept enough.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Where is she?
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
What do you mean?
How do you know?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
A Turkish brothel.
Well, what does it matter to you?
Don't bother!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
What??
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Humiliated?
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Do you think that's funny?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Yes!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
I don't know.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Tonight?
What for?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
Be careful!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Majesty.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Really?
Yes, indeed.
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
How many?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
I will, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Why? What has happened?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
What?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
What exactly are you working on?
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Yes?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
I do.
Would you? Actually, you could.
Do you believe in it?
We ended in F Major?
You go fast!
I think you'd better.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
But, Your Majesty -
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
And do they believe it?
Did you try?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
Yes.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
He's setting that play to music?
Where?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Thank you.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
No, why?
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How old are you?
I'm twenty-seven.
What? Oh, yes, please.
That's easy enough.
Very nice.
Bathroom.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Good.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I thought not.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Has he been refusing food?
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
I was having a nightmare.
So they said.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I really don't know.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Right.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
Nice to see you.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
You ask them.
Plan?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
I can't stand it.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
Stop it, Jack.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
You must believe me.
Hi, David.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Then you have some hot tea?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Why not?
No kidding?
He has?
How much?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Aw, nerts!
I remember once when your account checked.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Well, you can. You always could.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
John, how's your wife this morning?
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Sure, I think it's swell.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Absolutely.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Yes.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
Was it twelve o'clock?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Yes.
Nope.
Then I love it.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
The Army can hang him.
You're not scared, are you?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
What will be?
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
They gonna rush us?
I had you covered.  From back there.
Shit.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Maybe, maybe...
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Say your prayers?
But you got big!
A river pirate.
Not if I find the right girl.
Where will you find such a girl?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Stop it. This is just sad.
What?
Yes ma'am.
That's the idea.
You cocky little bastard.
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Not at all.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
What is going on here, man?
What, sir?
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It is a nice piece of writing.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Can't you tell me anything?
It's going to be a long spring.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
I know. Stop it.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Is it a what?
Pull out.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Yes, Courtney?
You just haven't been looking.
Really?
No-I can't take the time off work.
He's rich.
He has a great body
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Ye-es, Je-an?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Well...
You're at Paul Owen s.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Your address?
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
And where did he go to school?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
We were both seven in 1969.
What?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
People just...disappear.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
What?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
But Marcus denied it?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
Al.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
Yes, it is.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Didn't you visit the campus?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
I know, I know.
Milo. Why would he --
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
...What?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
I am. I am, sir.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Definitely.
Did you?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
'Sorry about the late notice...
Maybe we should all get on it.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
What're we looking for?
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
Where we going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Why's that?
She saved my life.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh.
That's lame, isn't it?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
What does that mean?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Behave!
To my health.
Smashing!
We know all that, Exposition.
Thank you.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
We won, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Be careful!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Sure.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
I couldn't have another bite.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Not now, Austin.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Are you crazy?
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Where did you learn to shoot?
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Shut up.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Dr. Evil?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
You didn't...
Why?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
I just don't see it.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I love you, Vanessa.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
There are limits?
... bottle ...
... head ...
Then you can't come in.
Looks like rain, Steed...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
So am I.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Then what's stopping you?
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
As per mother's instructions.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
I might say the same.
Why should they think that?
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Not for a moment.
I'm playing to win.
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
You first.
Have a look at this.
Where are you going?
As a matter of fact I have ...
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Insane ... ?
In your operation.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
She was ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Bond... James Bond.
What is this person's story here?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
C'mere.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Yeah.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Screw you!
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Right.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
It's all right...  So have I.
Mrs.?
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
I'm saved. Let's party!
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Right... Think it over.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
Who asked you?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
C'mon, let's crawl home.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I'll handle it.
Thanks for calling.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Well, you did invite me here.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
I wanted to be a good one.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Yes.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Who's doing this?
I want another shot, Sir.
I need another one, sir.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
What are you listening to?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Nice bunch of guys.
Just wondering.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
And DIE!
Cute.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
-- Burn it all.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
I might.
No Marty, I don't.
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Are you sure?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Please.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
What's your name?
You might be right.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
She's also moorish.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Must be the pressure.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
De-la-croix.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
No offense.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
And this is Manray.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
Mantan!!
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
What are there character traits?
It's me, Peerless.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Your father is proud of you.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Nobody told me anything.
This is Cheeba.
The big one.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
Is that good or bad?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
That's why it will be so much fun.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
He, I'm Mona.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
I just turned twenty.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
The best defense is offense.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
Never read a book in my whole life.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
How do you do, sir?
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Only the agency of servants.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
As much as possible?
What is to be done?
I see.
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
That son of a bitch.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Jesus!
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
The creek bed --
One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
We just want to check your pack --
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
What don't you know?
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Well?
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
I'm not gonna let that happen.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Why?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Little bit.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
So did I.
Think it'll work?
That's gonna stay my secret.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
You're a good man, Hardy.
What are you talking about?
I don't think I want to hear this --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
No one else heard it?
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Yes.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Eighteen.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I see. I thank you for your time.
Please. Go. Just go.
That's terrible.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Can I take your picture?
Well, it's not a short one.
I like your stories.
Karl.
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
I'm not scared.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Okay.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You know where the chemicals are?
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad!
What?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Okay. Okay.
You say...
Yes. Exactly.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Hello.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Because he's dying.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I do.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Probably tonight.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's romantic.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
But it's not true.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
So you never bought any land.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Thank you.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
What?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
They go.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
In the world.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Why?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You are throwing me out.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
It's alright.
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Oh, she older than that.
That'd be nice.
I do. God's truth. I do.
Hey.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah.
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
You need a ride?
Stop what?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Rose... please...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Come on, gal...
How long... how long I been out?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
I tried.
Looks like you know a song.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Word wit'cha. In private.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
This Rae... you get with her?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
Like I told you.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Or what?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I do.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Rae!
Holy shit!
I'm a what?
Got in a little accident.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
The hell you call me?
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Saving your life.
Let's grab some food.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
Yeah...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Sure.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Nick, you can't do this.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Gaiijin?
I paid for that.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Why?
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
You're foreigners.
He'll be dealt with.
The families who control the casinos?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Pris?
Then go get him.
Oh?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
You could help us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Thank you.
Tomorrow, he says.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Yeah.
Longevity is classified.  No.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Let's hear it.
Meaning?
Huh huh.
What if you change your mind?
Do you recognize any of them?
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Right.
Yeah.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Holden got hit.
I'll see you in a minute.
I'm tired of this.
What one?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Know what a turtle is?
Pris.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Thanks.
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Sure.
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Get away from me!!
Yes.
Okay.
I think it's the eyes.
What?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
They like Dr. Pepper.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
The engine is still running.
Good for you.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Goodnight!
My pleasure.
Neat. Goodnight!
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
No. Sit down.
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
And it's called...?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
It's so small.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
True.
Almost all of them.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
What?
Of what?
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Gladly.
Good!
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Are you in trouble, son?!
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
Good god.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Days??
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
As long as we've got that straight.
The locks?
I told you! I've got everything!
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Yes!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Coming!
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Yes.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Yes, dear, I know.
What can I offer you, Eve?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Who did he leave with?
Those sluts!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
He didn't leave with them.
What?!
I don't know. I like to think so.
Then what?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
You're all through with this now?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Lie down on the bed.
Yes.
Do you know?
Then don't talk about killing.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Falling.
Don? Are you in with them?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yes. Frank--
Frank is coming?
Sometimes I think I do.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Am I bothering you?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Alright.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
I'll drink to that.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Yes.
See ya tomorrow.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
No.
I can't dance fast.
Probably not. No. Why?
Sandy?
You can change it if you want to.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
What did you do, Connor?
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Ma, what's wrong?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Know any other languages?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
I'm serious.
A bit.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Rule of thumb?
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
Would they do that?
What do you think the cops have?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Bob?
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Hi.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
OK.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I'm not. But there's --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
What is it?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Bob!
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Thanks.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Take a deep breath.
Yes, he did.
No. Bob did.
Yeah.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
See you, Bob.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No. I wasn't adopted.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Where were you?
Wait a second.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
The one and only Little Richard.
Can you use a coaster.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Maybe she turned.
That's your domain.
OK.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
No. I was calm.
There were more than that.
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
I know it, man. Hang on.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Do you have your own cell?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
He's damn good.
We're just going over a few things.
He left his sweater.
No, my friend knows her.
Come on in!
Save it for Bourne.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Don't you want answers?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
What do you have, Danny?
Show me again...
I don't know who that is.
How long? How long do I have -- 
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
Switch! You drive!
There must be another way!
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
You do?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
That's a lie!
I was here!
I'm working on it.
What?
That's where we came out.
Still...
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
Alright...
Are we locked up?
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
It was in Latin, sir.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You mock us with a smile?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Hamish, I... thank...
I rest.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A common thief.
A patriot!
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Humbly, M'lord.
It matters not, he is thy king!
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
I... I blacked out.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
What? What could he do?
Fix?
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
You know my father?
Where are you now?
No, protecting her.
Where are my goddamn books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Huh?
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Hi, Lenny.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Come up here a minute.
Yes, sir.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
Er, good luck, yes.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
We said "no questions."
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
No.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
The clipper to America.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
His escape.
He is traveling with a lady.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Is everything ready?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Uh huh.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put it down!
-- You thought what?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Not right now.
Uh, my watch stopped.
Do too little you'll die.
No.
I'm putting it off.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Shut up.
As much as anybody.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Sure.
I had it on the island with me.
I thought I did.
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Don't even start.
I would never --
I would have done the same thing.
Anything else?
I most definitely say I am.
Mom, meet Jango.
It was fifteen minutes late.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
For the third time.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Believe me I know.
Permission granted.
They just want you to hire some new help.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
And that I can drive a truck!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Good night, Daddy.
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
*What* will be okay?
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
What do you want me to *do*?
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Liberator...
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
It's all very normal.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Is it true?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
Silicon Valley?
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
So what? We hide, right?
We're going to give him the money back?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
But you won't get that splatter effect.
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You can't cheat an honest man.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
You get an equal cut.
Don't worry about it.
And some new clothes.
Why?
Uh-huh.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
What about what?
What do you want? An apology?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
You sure we're clear?
What do we need another Shill for?
Good point.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
We're here.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
Is it that bad?
Maybe another time.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Sorry.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
Who was he?
How did you land that?
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What about a drink on the way home?
Why not?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Never. Why do you ask?
Leave me alone, Marion.
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
The debts.
Absolutely not.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
I can't do it, Jani.
Wait a minute...
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
I'll tell you later.
Five.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Eventual supernova.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Thanks.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
This is fun.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Of course not.
I like it up here.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Doolittle, hello?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Oh, yeah?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
How I make my living, what's your point?
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
How come I never hearda you before?
Where?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
It's a rule.
Yeah, me too.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Every week.
They took my daughter.
What else can we do?
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
But why can't we stay here?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Who is...
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
I'm not a half bad cook.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
Hardly...
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
You believe that?
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
You don't want to.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Nothing on Hannah?
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
It's a secret.
Unlikely.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Later.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Really?
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
Got any KISS?
Yeah, a man's drink...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
You got in the car, didn't you?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Check!
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Damn straight we are.
The paint!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
NOW!
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Are you AFRAID?
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
What happened?
Did you know him?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Not until like... eighth grade.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Sure.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Until it withers away.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You want to kiss me...
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What do you mean?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Don't you watch the news?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Do you feel alone right now?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Regret.
I think now that he might...
Because I'm so horny.
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Yep.
Kitty...
Where is she?!
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Airport Ho-Jo!
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
What?!
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
It's okay.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
You heard me. Where is it?
Bitch!
Yeah...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
I got a hairdo.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Yeah.
What?
Yeah.
That's enough!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
All right, let's go.
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
About - thirty-four seconds.
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
I don't want him.
Oh no, I can't do it.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
What do I get?
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
What did you say to her?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
You swine!
Was it -- swine?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh, would you...?
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
And here are my mother and father.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Everything will be seen to.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Good morning, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Indeed!
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I am very pleased to meet you.
I don't know what I've got.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Oh, no.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Want to come out?
You're English.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Yyyess.
Yyess.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Of course! What did you think?
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Who are they of?
Of course.
I thought as much.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Yes, very soon.
Yes! The workhouse!
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Yes sir.  What's that?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
WELCOME?
But surely you know...?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
And I thought you said it was something special...
Who?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
That I cannot tell you.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Yes?
The important thing is not to panic.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Oh, thanks.
Odin!
He wants to KILL us.
Well, you ARE!
You'll see!
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Well, come on!
She MUST have a knife or something...
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Well, where is he then?
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Can't make enough swords!
My brother blacksmiths!
Together we stand!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
No... he's not... not... there...
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Sweetie, we called the company.
Yeah.
Say hi to Naomi.
I remember.
Okay, I guess.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Really? Because --
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
I'm Joel.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Frost?
I'm fine.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Yes.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Really? Is he cute?
I love it!
Yeah.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Yeah.
Egad, were you horrified?
We did talk about Naomi.
Well, you're married.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
I know.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Make love?
A bully? Moi?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
I just walked in.
Oddly enough, I do.
Jesus.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
I'm like a joke to them.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Hi.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
You love him, don't you?
Listen, it's not erasing.
Shit!
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
That's fine, Stan.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Like what?
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I don't know anything about it.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Will it work?
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
"Another man?" Who?
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Hear what?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Some things you don't get over.
Start the countdown.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Do it.
What do you want me to say?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
What is it, Smith?
I just finished drying...
But you can breathe it.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Stay here! Don't stop working!
It's cold.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The forward airlock.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
I like the sound of that.
Is it safe?
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
About me? How sweet.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Victor's better at these things.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
Last one down springs for room service.
Ben! Ben!
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Then what is it?
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Yes, thanks.
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
I gave him twenty.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Sure.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Raising the shields.
It's the first door on your left.
Your friends use the pool too.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I didn't say that.
All right, then. It's your secret.
Mark is a really nice boy...
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Let's continue.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I guess I did.
I didn't see you this morning.
Hello.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
It's definitely your mama.
No.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Yeah?
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Sensitive -- what is that?
That's me, Merv.
Then don't hassle it.
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
Does that ever happen?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
That little prick.
He's not coming.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
I don't know. I guess so.
You're gonna flunk me?!
Yeah. She is pretty good.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Yes... It makes sense.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Naw! Not a major.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Like big lizards.
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Nobody. I'm the maid!
No! I swear I'm not!
That's a strange attitude.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
We're going to get my little girl.
Her fella.
But it's got teeth.
We're lucky to be alive.
Shit!
No. You?
Fuck no.
Go douche.
Oh yeah?
Who's with me?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Oh.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
But --
He's dead.
Good.
Is it gassed up?
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Go!!!
I'm fine, I really am.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Oh. I mean, good.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Come here. I want to show you something.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Where's Clifford?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
A rich actress.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Claire?
What night?
You want his name?
I know you believe that.
But I'll never win that.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
You sound as if you hate it.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Yeah, well --
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Harry.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Beats me.
Whattaya think you're in now?
To quarter-horses.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
But I want to. I'm trying!
What?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
I'll be back.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I don't believe so.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Really? Any problems?
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
I am afraid.
You speak.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
There, there... shhh...
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Is he not back yet?
It's far too late for him to still be out.
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Your decision. For us.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Now husband and wife.
No. But someday.
Can you think of a better reason?
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
You can't. Death is God's will!
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
I owe you that. Done.
Let it go.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
I was careless.
Okay.
You're welcome.
I can't, Barry...
Somebody'll see.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Whassamatta?
Girls can't be cowboys.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Have you ever been there before?
I have no idea.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
What about Kate?
Thank you, son.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Yes, they do.
You're a preacher?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
No!
-- you got your microwave --
-- see this, television!
Not even for lunch?
Whatsamatter?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
No.
Feels good.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
This ain't the time.
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Okay, I'll have one.
Yeah, it's mine.
Who's "we"?
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Really, I have no problem with --
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Straight up?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Fuck me.
Did you hear?
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
I saw an article...
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Last time I didn't.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Should I be afraid?
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Thought you two were file-closed.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Me!? You where the one...
Go in there. Talk to her.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Only one way to find out.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You never said it was off the record.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Oh my God! They're coming!
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Can I use some?
Five bucks.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
So have dinner with me tonight.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
We know.
Why are you telling this to me?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
We, have already taken care of them.
It's Raymond.
Where are you?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Where's my bed?
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
Alex? Where are you going?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Yes but, we were wondering-
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
GO Commander.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
All systems are working, Commander.
Covalent... Right. So...
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
All right. Put me back on with him.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
We pretend...
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
... Maintenance facility...
Wh... Where are we?
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Oh god...
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
What does she see in them?
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
Same old story.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
We better, Congress invented him.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Oh, come now...
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Surely you knew this was coming.
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
I'm very aware of that.
What else?  From Virginia?
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
You know very well who it is that I love.
That's a lie!
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
I think America suits you.
That's good... who?
Yes!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
You're right.
So... how many movies you been in?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I don't believe this.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Who is this?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Who?
Never heard of him.
You say look at you?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I'm in the movie business.
I'm a producer.
Get him out've here.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Who's the star?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
You don't even know these guys.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Here's another tip...
I know what a vig is.
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
Don't go out of your way.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
Then you've read it?
Depends, who pays?
What happened?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Harry -–
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Maureen.
Threw a turbine blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
But how long?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
How about you Epps?
Yeah, yeah.
Not me.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
What do you propose?
I think you know.
What the fuck -- ?
If money can buy what he wants.
You're a pal.
Sudden flashes of light.
What?
February first.
Collision? With what?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Not our mystery guest again.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
What?
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
I think I see it pretty well.
Let the buyer beware.
Looks like it's adrift.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
Fifteen, at the most.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
Hello...
What are you trying to say?
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Well, yes...
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
I guess.
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
How long have you been up?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Why do I always have to do it?
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Bingo!
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Everybody's too stupid!
Anthony's II!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Don't worry.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Great...
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It just came yesterday...
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Who does?
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
You don't know what you're talking about.
What?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Indian records?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Really? Can I see it?
I - I'd really rather not...
"Yet."
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
Are you okay?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Oh, hi...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What about this?
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
No... they said she was here...
I don't know... where is she, then?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Let me see the sick.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Don't they, though?
But overall, you're pleased?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Then why do you stay?
That is correct.  Nothing.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Have you got that in writing? 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
Actually, no.
Only in life... 
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
Because I think they're after you.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Thank you.
Didn't I do it?
I'll supervise.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Let me jingle you right now.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Command me, lord.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
You need the exercise.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
There's something very familiar about this painting.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
What kind of tests?
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Well don't think!
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Eight o'clock?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Yeah, yeah.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
I think I should spend the night here.
Out!
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Can't you tell me now?
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Is that a game?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What is it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Great!  How's it going?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
That's "Peck!"
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Look!
And the seas would boil ...
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
If I may be so bold...
Yes?  Go on!
Send them out!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
I'll nose around...
Why you?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
As soon as I can.
Well, they die for it!
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
No!
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
Chain him.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Of course not.
I'm glad.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Benjamin -- I really do.
You mean the one who --
At the Zoo.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
What?
I don't understand --
Then what?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
You mean you're confused?
Yes.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Why do you have to see him?
No, Benjamin.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
Yes I am.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Get out!
Yes.
Could you bring it up?
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Right.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
What do you drink?
I don't know.
Yes.
Like what?
Sit down.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Yes?
Right.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Jesus Christ!
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Why don't you watch?
INADEQUATE!
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Neither.
Yes I do.
There isn't any.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Thank you.
We don't.
How many times a year.
Was he a law student at the time?
At college.
Then let's hear them.
Yes.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
What the hell have you done?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
What?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Great.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Yes, I am rather.
Who?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
No -- why? -- should I?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Certainly.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Am I quite strange to you?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
Just for a minute then.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
What can you see?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Oh -- 
I know.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
You do believe that I really love you?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
On the train?
Then you know him?
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
A little strange, Baron.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Ready, Baron.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Telegrams?
This gentleman can have my room.
The Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- you would!
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Really?
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Then you will please wait outside.
Moreover...
I got ten marks for that.
With the same friend?
Can't you understand me?
...weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Hello!
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
It's urgent.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
I understand perfectly.
A thousand marks -- 
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
All you have to do is phone for it.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
There was -- there was.
Certainly, sir.
I could not think of not accepting.
-- We must do something...
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
I know -- I know.
Good night.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You're a thousand percent right!
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Hah.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
You know who I work for.
I know.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
No?
Well...
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Only one tooth?
Sure.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I pay my debts.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
You, too, Roy.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
This way's perfect.
Just a few bucks.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Oh, don't be stupid.
I'll see you when you get home.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Myra, I'm not following this.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Upstate.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Bullshit!
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
That's natural.
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Nothing's missing?
It's an option.
No.
Get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Okay... thank you.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
What?
He's my brother.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Very insightful.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Answer what?
The voice man!  He's here!
But I've seen him!
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
God ... this can't be true.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Stay away, Sam.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
You've come to the right man.
Blue soup.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
That can be arranged.
You're making a joke.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
For what?
Gee whiz--
You're my buddy.
Out!
Are you--
Everybody says he was so brave.
She met him at college.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Excellent!
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Go on.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Can't it keep till morning?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Nothing.
Eighteen--  and a half.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
You're wrong.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Rifle?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Blue soup?
Sounds quite beautiful.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
You hope this, too?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Do it, Norbert.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
You startled me.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Would you say that again?
We have, have we?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
The new hero is you.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
More clowning!  Don't you see?
I'm going to shoot you now.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
It was a bitch.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
Something's made you sore.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
For Heaven's sakes!
Yeah.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
My father!
Keeps fairies away!
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
Is he all right?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
Tonight's the night.
That's the XKE.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
Thanks.
Penelope!  We're late!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Pull out your cock.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
What do you mean?
What's that shade of blue called?
If you say so.
You know her?
Where's he?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Fuck.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Who's paying you?
You are.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I don't know.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Who is Ratan?
It's just a name.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What is going on?
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Rucker.
Take it or leave it.
Good.
It's a short film.
But I...
I don't know nothing, man.
Jake.
What's that?
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Was he with a girl?
Yes, I am.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Took it?
Hello.
Is this your shovel?
Officer, I can explain.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, look! The birds.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Maude???!
What is that he's working on?
What were you fighting for?
What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
With Life.
Oh.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Maude.
It's all right. It's organic.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
And why is that?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
What else do you like?
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Yes, sir.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Another man's life in your sights.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Harold!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Time to play.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
What?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Because I'm going to get my father!
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
You're doing fine.
We're on the move.
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Those things never work. Never.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
No. I never was.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
...Polo.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
HE did. I've seen him.
I have to speak to my father.
This isn't happening.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
That's right. Who are you?
Back from where?
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
Keep your voice down.
What?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
So what's the argument?
I hear you.
In here.
Can I get you anything?
I don't know where to begin...
Drinking alone.
That's more like it.
No, not much.
No personal details?
Am I?
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Call me tomorrow.
Is Julia here?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Steve?
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
He's gone.
That's right. Cointreau.
If there's a train.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Oh no.
If I make it through the day.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Sure. Why not?
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What band?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Yes way.  It's really...
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Right.  Why?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is that it?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Huh?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I think you know that.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
No.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I don't have your number.
You do, huh.
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You know I'm a good person.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Hey, how ya doin'?
In a minute.  When I get it together.
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
What about Ian?
Okay.
Okay.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I know.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Thank you.
Yup.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Fine.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
No.
Carl Smith.
-Okay okay.
Yes.
Tradition.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'd rather hear yours.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
Go home.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're wrong.
A factor of age.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
You killed those other two.
What about that family in '31?
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
What is it you want?
Thanks.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Pheasant.
Yes.  Always.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
This is madness!
No!
You will live.  Survive.
Go to hell.
Of course.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Me father has taken back my hand.
I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
As you wish.
This isn't done.  Get up.
And if I refuse?
I presume it's a sword.
All I need is time.
I'm sure that's true.
What doing?
What's the idea of locking this?
Open this door!
The poem?... The poem was great!
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Fine.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
How?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Thanks a lot.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
The power of the press, huh!
Hello, Hildy!
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You -- you --
What's the matter?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Say, could I meet him?
You're not afraid, are you?
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
What do you mean?
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
I'd like to think.
Huh!
Is he coming back here?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Yes.
What is it? Here!
Who did you talk to?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
You -- you!!
You know you did!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
They can't do that to me!
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
I think it is.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
You said it!
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Good coffee, isn't it?
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
What?
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
What went off?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
If there was any way out...
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
I'll go right after it.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Where's the money?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Huh?
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Isn't that her picture?
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Well, maybe you think I could!
You mean here in the city?
Is it hard?
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
I know.
Apparently so.
No, she didn't.
Looking for shrapnel.
Sod.
Bloody.
Could.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
I'm starting my own collection.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
A bit too quick.
Air-raid?
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Naturally.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
They'd gone.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
The ideas you get in your head.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
There, there, my baby.
Up to six weeks, I think.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I know you mean well.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
He left!
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Wondering what?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Holy crap, thanks!
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Really fucking awesome.
Here he comes.
Turn that fucking radio off!
There's a dog in the road.
Is that all... think real hard.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Grab Mary and come inside.
So what?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Keys.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
Oh, you mean on TV.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
I um... no, I don't think so...
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Who's your Daddy!
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
That's it?
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
French?
Oui.
Oui, doctor, oui.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Not at all.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Oui.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Oui.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Very well.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Won't he be able to tell?
Be still my crotch.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Ready!
Shut up, you.
You've got to respect that.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
I have to think! I have to think!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Extra dessert?
Unn.
No.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
I've never been to Louisville.
To win.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
What is?
Character.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
A thousand.
What's that supposed to mean?
I told you. I got drunk.
Seventy-five per cent.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
I feel tight -- but good.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Get with what?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Go to hell.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
A son.
Talk to me, Charlie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Glad to meet you.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Okay, friend.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Try me.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Thanks. I will.
Can I sit down?
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
No, not always.
You don't look like a college girl.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eggs. How do you like them?
No, why should I? It's yours.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
Does it bother you? What he said?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Hundred dollars?
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Yes.
Yes.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you mean?
Stay alive.
I surrender --
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Is the hill ours too?
Why, Dad?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
Was there anything over the hill?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Mr. Gardner, I --
Yes.
No, but it was here.
Who are you calling?
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
What?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Connie, don't hang up.
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
I'm thinking.
Dad, don't start.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Great.
Then God help us.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Yes, I am.
He's my angel.
So push it!
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
And before here?
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
You've got it!
All my life!
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I knew it was you --
What?
Where is it? I want it.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Right.
Don't worry. He won't.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
I'm out, Dad!
Brody's this way.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
I was the next man.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Ready.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I don't need camels.
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
Then we'll die.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
I don't like to show off.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Siam.
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
Their children?
A SNAKE!!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
That's good -- you're doing fine.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
A what?!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Quiet!
So now they believe me.
What above the curves?!
You got it!
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
It wasn't him.
Who?
This candid camera?
Why don't we go home?
Who am I?
Me? What'd I do?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna explain.
Why he's argumentative?
Why don't you?
Why not?
Why? AL  You know too much.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Nothing. You just do nothing.
What about it?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
How should I know?
Wait.
What are you looking at?
It is my business. It's my name.
That place. By the window.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
You think. That's what you're good at.
Looks like you can have all you want.
Rene?
You've changed your mind.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
What part what?
Good.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
What a nerve!
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
That name's familiar.
What?
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Take the card.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
No. No one to speak of.
...Rene.
Me still. They left you alone?
...and sort of...disinterest.
Disinterest?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
You seemed interesting.
There's not much to tell.
Food doesn't agree with me.
What is it?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
How?
Get us one.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
What?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've  been there?
Can you?
Sure I can, can't I?
They asked about you.
That I really don't know.
Her?
I told you, I work for him.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Why'd you invite me here?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Yes.
For reading.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Where?
Yeah.
Mom.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
Push it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, I love that stuff.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
Before you go...
No, no, we're fine...
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
What's the difference...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Oh, baby...
No, you do not.
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Yeah.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
You eating with us?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Everything interests me.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Far as you go where?
Did work.
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
They should be.
You okay?
Tempura...
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
ABC...?
You greased the rails!
Hello, can you hear me now?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
You called me.
There is -- there is no family.
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
It acts as a...
That's why we hire scientists...
Here. Got pictures.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
So she's uh, flourishing?
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
No...
Who's the pigeon?
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Mr. Massey?
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
You have the pre-nup?
Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
It's about time.
Did you see the tape?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
I told you. I was hungry.
Well, don't look at mine!
Absolutely.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Huh?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Yes. Again.
I have a watch.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Meaning my house.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's blackmail.
That's marriage.
Murder?
Murder!
I thought so.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Please!
Of Massey Myerson?
He has a reputation for being tough.
I'm dying.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
She's here now.
I don't have a pre-nup
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
But then... But then...
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Nothing.
Video.
I am very sorry.
Is she going through with it?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
I knocked several times.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Is that his name?
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
You talk as if—
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Oh, yeah?
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Yes.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
My ticket?
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
This isn't "piggy-back."
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
There's no end to your accomplishments.
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
What for?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
In about fifteen minutes.
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
What's that?
Thanks.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Get out!
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Oh!!
Yes, Ma.
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Huh?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
There were no phone records.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
You're not digging.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Where you going, boss?
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
I did.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Calm down, Dave, what?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Who was paying you, Dave?
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Four to six.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
David Ferrie.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Take a look across the street.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
His name?
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
And he never hit you before?
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
She's the best damn witness we have!
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
And what would I have to do?
Do you walk home?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Uh-huh.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I can't believe you do me this way.
And you didn't tell the Police?
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
What time do you have to be there?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
That's my diet shit.
Thanks.
Bet you're happy to be working again.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I thought you might want a drink?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
I am, as a matter of fact.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
No, you didn't. What branch?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
It's nice.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He called you?
It's different with men.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
He was here?
I see.
Has he hinted around?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
Did you do it that night?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
In the bag underneath.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
I didn't say you did.
Spain.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
He say is a surprise.
You two meet?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
Was she there?
Uh-huh.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
What about you?
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Great...  ...Wanda!
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Beaumont Livingston?
Keep it between us girls?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Yeah.
All your money's in Mexico.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
If you want.
I was there, I saw her do it.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Where at?
Two months shy of four years.
What's a Metrix?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You lived in Japan, when?
Yeah.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
No.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Then what?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
I dunno.
I'm in my underwear.
What did he do?
Yeah.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
What does that mean?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
In the chest and stomach.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
How long was she in there?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Hear what?
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Git your ass in here.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
I know where it is.
You know it's for you.
He leave town?
Give me his home number.
No! Oh God.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
That's right. We did.
They're not interested, Jake.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
I am.
Shit!
Her knee acting up?
She talk about the boys?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
It's good to see you.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Whataya mean, no record?
I'm not cold.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Gee, thanks a lot.
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
Yeah, but for what?
The best.
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Get your clothes off.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
What?
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Let go!
It might be for me.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Me neither.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
I'm not upset.
Jake, what is it?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Shows how much you knew.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Push 'em back.
I'm awake?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Everywhere, like a plague.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Is he all right?
Pour it in.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
We don't have time to argue!
We made it?
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
My job.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
No you don't!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
I thought you meant...
Okay, good tip.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Did you like it?
She needs a little time.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
We're screwed.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Kay-em 14.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
What?!!
That's right, now if you could...
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Where...?
Full throttle! To port!
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Older, sillier.
You going to be all right?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
Maybe we can save August...
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Our friend, the shark.
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Be careful, for chrissake.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I can't imagine why.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
You love sharks?
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Yep.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
He's busy.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Down here, Hooper!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I'm not hungry, oddly.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
I'm pregnant.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Charisma?
I'll try to drop by later.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
We could get back together too.
Were we together?
Why?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Cool it.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No, more commercial stuff.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Yeah?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Is Vanessa here?
Come on, I have something for you.
No?
But you're old!
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Then what's going on?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Unfortunately, yes.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Right, seriously.
Keith's hot.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
A Pilates machine?
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
Can you see it?
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Thank you.
That French ain't it?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
You can?
Could I try that?
Hold still.
Yeah.
I heard that.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
How much do I owe you?
Forget it.
Wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Damn right I do.
Thank god!
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
I'm finished.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
No, thanks, I can manage.
No.
No, never. Excuse me.
...You're hurting me...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
What is it?
Could be.
17.
Umm. Altogether?
Were they wearing condoms?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Let me smell it again.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
78th.
Den less go Joe.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Casper, where's Telly.
Nothen' B.
Where you goin' tonight?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
No...
Yeah.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
Were you protected?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I didn't bleed.
Passion...
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yep.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Oh shit.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Not too late.
Hello?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
How'd you get in here?
No, I need the original note.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
Just a second.  Hello?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
You're not going to tell me that.
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
What makes you think I was there?
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
Come here.
I'm Kathy.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Of course.
Thanks, David.
For what?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
That's great.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
What does that mean?
Through a rental agency.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
About what?
Who says something's on my mind.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Are you one of the players?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
I don't think I could.
It wasn't intentional.
Why?
Alright.  What about me?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Me too.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
We're almost married.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
You must move away from the Center.
All the passages are guarded.
The new Queen lives.
Turold's son was to marry her.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
<u>Why</u>?
You will know, in good time.
I road them often in my youth.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Can't I come, too?
And what do you think a small person lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination.
I only want one.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Look at its insides.
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
No. He will master the leader.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
It is the time.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
She has the power to kill.
She had another name once.
Fewer will survive them.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
She bore you many children?
No.
No?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
No, you can't go out.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
I love you so much, Leon.
...Don't you like me?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Three times, then two times.
...One second.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Messina.
Yes... Twice.
...Yeah.
Then...
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Where?
I have new dreams now.
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
Can it kill me?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Anything?
Why do you polish it?
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
I will -- I promise.
Please tell me.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
It'll make it.
That's a reasonable assumption.
Jumped where?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Perhaps there's another route?
Pulitzer, here I come.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Tomorrow.
Walking where?
I told you.
You're amazing.
Steph.
Do you have a car, Steph?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
What?  Who are you?
We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
No.
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
You do?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Yes.
Don't be silly?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Right... OK...
OK.
Well... OK...
I know that...
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
What did they look like?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I am lonely, Yuri.
With an old friend.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
You're fired. I have new representation.
Who?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
That's not what's important.
Sort of.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
How?
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Is everything okay?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Aristotle.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
You're kidding!
Margot!
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
Did she do that to you, too?
Neat.
I wasn't gonna --
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
And you know this for a fact?
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
What happened?
Are you sure?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
Of course.
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Why do you say that?
Always.
We go out, smash 'em now?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Why have you brought me here?
No.  Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Flozen foleva not good.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Gump, is it?
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
And if she thinks me a liar?
Careful, lad.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Aye!  That too.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
We'll find it.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
The chill is worse this night.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
The alicorn, lad.  Come to your senses!  Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I could have struck off his head just now!
Sapphire!
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
They'll do nicely.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Are you honest?
To fetch your napkin.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
Sunlight?
Biting you?
I can't see a thing.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
I don't believe you.
Wondrously so.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Be fair, Oona.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
You're a good girl.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
Tell him I said "hi".
No thanks.
Why are you so stupid?
Floating to Catalina.
He's got a standing invitation.
It could have been a squirt gun.
That's too long.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
I didn't recognize you!
I want you both to stay.
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
The gloves on the table are for you.
Don't.  I don't want it.
What would you like to be?
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
You lied to me!
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I need you to do me a favor.
Where he always is.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
A blueprint spool.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Money?
The garage.
I'm married.
Which?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
My stupid back.
You're a good mother.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Nothing.
I wasn't sure.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
His father is a man.
I'd be you.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Dad said it first.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Is Mae Rose okay?
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Then what's the problem?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
But I'm having a good time...
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I don't think so.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
You're soft.
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Guess we better get going, huh?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
So?
He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
Go where, Ray?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
So?
They're touching.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
Rayford!
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
He must still be in there.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Something like that, yes.
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Release the evil?
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
You did it for Namath.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
How bad?
I know, your wickedness.
It's Stanley, sir.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
So I followed him...
All right...
Dude. Seriously?
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
No.
See something you like, my man?
Where do you send them?
What other food?
Just the face.
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
When do you go up?
You felt sad. What's your name?
Jessica.
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I'm not armed.  Well?
K.
You know.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
I let him go... believe me.
Please? What friends?
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
You're not going, are you?
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
And yours.
We'll be all right...  We will...
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
Not yet.
More... many more.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Stay? They lived together all their years?
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Yes, I thought my wife...
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
We should stop seeing each other.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Sit down.
No.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
No... I don't. Why?
He won't give his name.
I don't know yet.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
A videotape.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I guess so.
All right.
But...
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Who is this?
Okay.
No. No, I don't.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
Whatiya mean?
No... I told you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Found in Asia!
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Will you stop squawking!
Please don't call me Lovey.
Have I?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
And be poisoned out here in the open?
In a quandary.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
It's unbelievable.
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
That's intelligent.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
—buy and sell?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Well, is it?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Suppose she should leave it?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
Yes.
How can we get in touch with them?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Hello? Colonel?
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Shhh!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
Yes, everything!
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A man whose life was empty!
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Bump?
I'd love it!
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
English!
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
What?  I thought you just--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir--
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
It was a long time ago.-
You don't know me at all.
The radio show?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Get back in the car!
The Pentagon.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
For how long?
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
What is it?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
How could it not?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Agatha...
Anderton --
The other two will die without me.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Why?
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Uh-huh...
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
What?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
You're kidding, that's today?
Run the subscription list...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
What?
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Because it was going to fall.
To Hineman?
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Oh... Hi, John.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
All right, I'll try...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
What the hell.
Sean --
No.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
And how did Lamar become involved?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
Do you?  Really?
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
You said they're destroyed.
What safe place is that?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
Then how did he --
I don't know who that is.
Lamar --
My God...
Where are you?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
What kind of cop were you before this?
Yes.
That was our apartment.
Have you been there recently?
It was nobody's fault.
But there's still the other two.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Where's the place to go tonight?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
He's great, right. Is he great?
It's daytime.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
I'll support you.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Yeah.
Yeah?
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
You told him you liked him.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Bobby.
Traveling light. I like that.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
I'm on the phone.
What are you saying?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
Yeah. I know the number.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Sorry coach.
This is bullshit, man.
He woulda told us right?
Fuck this.
Back in.
Fine.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
He wants to see us now.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Eighty.
What about it?
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
S'up.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Yes.
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
'Strapped?'
No?
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Here...
Come, now. You just got here.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Yeah.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
And where do we bring it?
What about my keys?
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
It's a digestif.
He has a cute what...?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
I like you, country.
I'll give you back the 600.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
That's what Mama used to say.
What for?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Just an idle question.
Did you hear what I said?
I just want to sit here and be still.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Betty it's me. It's me.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Let's cancel.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
500.
You're my father.
Me?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
I ain't doing bad.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
You the man!
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Head nigger in charge?
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Yes sir.
He's bright.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
What do you want?
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I don't know shit about you.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
So you are going to talk me to death.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[What is his name?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Who ordered it?]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[You stole the drop.]
Show me, please.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
If they like me.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
That's right.
But why not?
Yes.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Yeah. Two or three.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Could I stop you?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
You do?
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
That's ridiculous.
What was she to Creasy then?
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Yeah, sure.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
Who?
It's her baby too, you know.
You told me.
What happen?
Marty.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
I'm having a very good time, too.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
I don't.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Marty...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
All right.
Sure.
No, I'm not kidding.
That's the one.
Sure, what?
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
So I'll die without a son.
Ma! Leave me alone!
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
You want a beer, Ang'?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
What nurses?
This is a good deal here, Marty.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Well...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
He's parted his moorings.
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Or her figger.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Yeah, if I can.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
I have a tent to myself.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
We're a good team.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Right.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
All of them?
I think we could still have a chance.
It isn't always this rough?
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Second pint.
You really say the cutest things.
Yeah!
Yes, Reverend?
Just in dreams?
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Sir?
Oh, get out of here!
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Nice.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
No.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Thirty dollars.
Yes, sir.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
The letter from John Doe.
Right here. Sit down.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Go out and find her!
Who?
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
It must be some kind of a gag.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Huh? Get what?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
How?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Did you write it—or didn't you?
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
No, sir.
Dinner's on you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
You got it.
Johnny who?
Is there a problem?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper, we're into it...
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I've rarely shot anyone.
National Marksman Competition.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Where did you hear that?
It'll come. Try again.
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Let me show you something, Ray.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
As a matter of fact, I do.
And it's hard to get.
Just now.
It's very nice.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Scott...
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Depends. What's up?
What do you need?
I need to take back what's mine.
They have nothing to do with this --
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
-- No.
In a computer program.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
One would assume so.
What about the customers with reservations?
The weather.
The woman you're stuck on.
There is no --
-- Yes.
Go!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
Why?
-- Who did he digitize?!
Then where is she?
-- Katie.
Yes.
There was no other choice.
-- Transmit now!
-- Standard.
Speed?
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
... I just pray we're not too late.
I think so.
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
Release the power with the power.
THERE'S THE COMET!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
So they've been destroyed?
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
Tell me about it.
Whatever you say, Boss.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
So what happened?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
For what?
It's a mask.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
You gotta plan these things.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
I've got friends.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
We learn from life.
I'll take care of the Boss.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You disrespect our tradition.
I turned him down flat.
We were overdue to get hit.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
You wouldn't live out the week.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
YOU SET ME UP!!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
He called me "Doc."
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I might wake up.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
We like to think so, yeah.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
You want to come inside?
How are you doing sweetheart?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
Mother!
Mm hmm.
... Manly?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Yeah.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Good idea. When?
Well, let's get going.
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
What is it?
We're waiting, Hubert.
Oh! Go away.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Horace Mill--!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Himself!
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Yes, I was--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
It does!
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Jefferson--
Just fine.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
J-Jefferson Smith.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Try sitting down.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Go right ahead.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Abigail.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Must have been tickled pink.
Already? All these letters?
Second drawer.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Saunders--!
Hurray!
Where do we go from here?
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
Yes, sir--
You were about to recognize me, sir--
How's that, buddy?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Well--I can *manage*--
What do you mean? What's going on?
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
What's the matter?
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Go away, Nosey.
Okay. See you here.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Why don't you do it yourself?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
What do you think?
You can't say *that* to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Yes, I—
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Yes, you own it.
He sure is.
No! I resigned last week!
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
You said I was a lady in distress.
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Let's just walk, okay?
In a day or so, I think.
A girl?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Mary - I - excuse me—
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Yeah, then what?
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Had the boys follow us.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
John—
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
I wanna see that guy!
Proceed.
Hang up.
All set.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
When?
No, thanks.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Are those stories true?
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Naturally.
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
South Dakota north.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Yes, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
I did what!
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
What's that?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
I think he's got a point.
Good, then go.
Henry!
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
Althea hasn't told you?
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
You do?
Well, come on in.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
...And?
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Can you help Mom?
Did you straighten her out?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
We'll work it out.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
That's what I like.
That's one way to put it.
You're upset.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I'm glad.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
But...
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
In maybe three or four issues.
True. Should we stop them?
What'd he say?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Jerking off?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Holy shit!
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
You're completely reliable.
I guess that makes sense.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Excuse me?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
You shall see.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
What are you doing here?
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
No?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
I think you found something.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
I'm your sister.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
Of course.
And what's that?
I'll be down in a jiffy.
I'm his daughter.
Do it, big boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Why not?
Me.
Then why are you here?
What?
What's your real name?
And what if you get killed?
What?
Yes.
Now you're talking.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
But I just don't feel it.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Oh shut up.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Ow.
But... the silverware?
You did?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
This looks like a job for Superman --
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Please...
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
It is a terrible shock.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Oh -- where do you come from?
When you eat him, may I have some?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
My God, what a fire!
Impossible, I don't believe it.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
That is correct.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
It is time to clarify the situation. Everything is over between us.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I don't understand you.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
Yes.
I wrote it.
How do you know?
Yes.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
That is correct.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
And where do you place Alexander?
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
Thanks, Unc.
Suga!
Don't move me.
I'll do it.
You know what he mean, dude.
I'm gone.
What about the dog?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Why?
What you mean, so?
That ain't gonna work.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
It's locked.
Hold on.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
He's inside the house?
Ya'll live around here?
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Good, let's get out.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Elroy.
I threw my back, again.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
Who, him? Just visiting.
You just come in on Amtrack?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
'S okay. What do you think?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
That's...a comfort to hear.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
What?
Indeed.
For not believing you.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
What's your point?
Tell me why I miss him.
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
No, that's,..that's fine
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Okay...
We made it.
No way.
Let' s do it.
Right.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I know you do, honey.
To be a hero?
No, kisses to...
What are you supposed to do?
Yeah, all right, listen...
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
I don't think so.
Shut up.
Right there.
You're wasting time.
Just put her on.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Yes! Yes!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
The devil wins sometimes!
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
You what?
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Dead. 
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Is that all?
Come on, children!
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Come to me, boy!
Yes?
Where's the money hid.
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
The first night?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
I -- no, I --
Yes.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
What?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
Get the kit!
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Just want to talk to him a second.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
She lived there.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
To bed with you, c'mon.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
He's nuts about you.
No more fights.
What are you serving?
And you too, Ninotchka.
I see.
Yes.
Just for the honeymoon.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
You didn't get legal advice?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
I don't feel like any breakfast.
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
It is Thursday!
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Razinin.
No, no.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Monsieur.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
What can I do about it?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Don't hold that against me... please!
You believe in our cause?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
He takes good care of that.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Thank you.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Then how did you get here?
This is a place for workmen.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
Then you should go back to your table.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
No... go on.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
And General Savitzky.
What, darling?
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No! No!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
No, no music.
It is their wish.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Now, Swana...
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
That bad?  Old or young?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
I must insist that you leave.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Unfortunately.
Why?
Please... sit down.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Raw carrots and beets.
This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Then his office will be fine.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Son of a bitch.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I'll bet he would.
Is it?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
And if I stay?
That fruitcake!  What about him?
All right.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
No!
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
Let him finish, Bob.
... worrying whether someone said something "nice" about them.  All short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy liking him ...
What about happiness, Mother?
What'd you say?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
No.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Winning?
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
I won't tell him if you won't.
She's quite pretty.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Yes.
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
That's right.
Of them.
Yes, yes.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not a failure, Dick.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
And then you'll be happy?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yes!
And what am I doing?
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
You heard it?
How fresh is this coffee?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
You figure him for a dope runner?
Believe you're right.
Yessir.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Okay.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Well I didn't see it.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yeah.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
You know what's goin' on?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
Where does he work?
You from around here?
Airport.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
I was just passin' the time.
Yessir.
Just call it.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
Not any way.
No. You don't understand.
I'm retired.
I don't know. American citizens.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
...plenty
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
You're lying!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
No, I didn't have to.
I know plenty.
They're fine... you miss it?
Oh, this is wonderful...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Yes... maybe it was.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Los Angeles, California.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Dr. David Ravell.
Like Rome?
Worse.
You made out alright.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Fine.
...okay.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
He is real.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Good.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
A mark, huh?
He told us it's in the Buick.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Half.
What?
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
I'm not telling.
I never said that I believed...
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
I see.  May I?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
I'll think about it.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
"A Reason to Love."
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
You can't do this -
Gopher, Everett?
Where's Tommy?
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
Everett, my beard itches.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Helluva awgazation.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Powas p'suasion.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's good, honey.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
You said -
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Well sure, honey, but...
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Isn't it, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Yes, sir.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Yes, Joe.
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
I said, come here!
We don't have to talk at all.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
You what?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
But in what ways?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
And you turned him down??
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
I'm starving.
I don't want you to move.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
That's brilliant.
I can't risk it.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Please...
That's their problem.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
NOT THAT ONE?!
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Everything okay?
Can we come in?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No ball, kid.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
I said open the door.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
The crowd goes wild.
478...
That room!
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Shaky?
Say fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
I don't know, why?
YOU HAVE TO!
Stop it.
Why?
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
What, I don't know how you mean?
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
No.
Uh... uh... I...
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Do you?
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
No...
You learned her lessons better than I.
She is.  Don't go in there.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
Please.
That's five, keep going...
Fall, six months at the earliest.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
How many men have we seen die?
Yes... you will wait.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
Earned.
But father, they might come this way.
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Of course I will.
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Because you promised.
What?
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Yes.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
We're still not where we're going.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
I'm not climbing that.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Wendigo?
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Now.  No, don't kill him.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
Did you, now?
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
-- then we never would have met.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
To the Black Pearl.
First -- have you found me a crew?
We're catching up!
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
This must be some important boat.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
Where does it make berth?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
We need to go!
'Bootstrap?'
That's not true.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Jack!
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
My apologies, Governor.
No.  She hasn't.
Please.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Consideration?
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
The trunk.
Thank you, sir.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
What waste?
That's right.
You're the doctor.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
The head shrinker at the prison.
Let's go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
We've got to get the nanobot.
The same thing I suppose.
I remember I was trying to help...
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Thanks, I will.
Huh?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Yeah - go on.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
I bet.
I didn't run away.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Not since you broke into society.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Been where?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Right.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
It'll be ready in a minute.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
That's putting it crudely, but—
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Double strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
I have. Double-strength!
With pleasure, Madame!
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
Well, sir, I putter.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Ah.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Thanks.
It's alright.
But you can't go out there.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
But where would we go?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
No. Of course not.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Real rain?
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
What color is that hedge of yours?
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
As a matter of fact he does.
What do you mean?
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
... Yeah.
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Yeah.
We'll just put up the top.
Marmalade.
What department store did they go to?
Ooomph?
Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
What the hell's going on!
I had nothing to do with that.
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
Yeah but what are you doing?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
D&D Mattress Man.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Why?
So it's ok if I bring her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Why?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I just want to know where she's staying.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
No.
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
...yeah....well you have me now.
Not very late.
You don't even know how much it is.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I didn't lie.
It was cool last night.
....this is your mistake....
They're not open yet?
Do you know them.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
Do you want to pick me up?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Yeah.
....Hi.....
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Did something happen; are you alright?
Oh that's great.
Ok. Have a good trip.
Thank you.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
Yeah.
This is nice.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
I'm sorry.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Why?
I didn't do it.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
No one will know your name.
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I'll say whatever I want --
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Thank you.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Wait a minute --
What do you have in the house?
You have an ATM?
Yes.
Yes. Sorry.
Well....what do you want, then?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
You can't be late.
I'm serious.
Ok.
David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
You among them?
Do I have your word?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- the passion in your heart --
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
You're a sentimental man.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
What could cause a tincture like this?
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delbenè?
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
Most assuredly.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
Go on, child.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
I wonder sometimes.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Over at RKO?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Yeah
Why is that, Louis?
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
Sir? 
Sir?
Please be quiet.
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
No -- no -- I mean--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Nonsense
Nope.
Showing life
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
I'll hire you  -- right now-
And what does he see?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
The title?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
But it's not a great syllable
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Oh God.
Again
Pardon?
They've all seen a rough cut
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
I really think you're
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
He's Christ?
About what?
For what?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
I'm Ok.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
Nine o'clock.
Three more, I figure.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
It's OK.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Do what I say.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
You're not interested in him?
I never noticed his face.
All I did...
Jake...
Why don't you just call him up?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
C'mon, Tommy --
He should.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
He has it. Thank you.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Six ayem.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Jeff -- huh?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Ever get an answer?
Mrs. Thorwald.
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
You sure it belongs to his wife?
Your logic is backward.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Who are you?
Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
Stella!
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
She pay you much?
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Huh?
You called the police?
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Yes.
You haven't even heard from him?
Goodnight, you idiot.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
Make the one you want.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
What are you getting at?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
That's a suitcase?
I do?
Who was the trunk addressed to?
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Two minutes.
A new disease.
What?
I like you, you know?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
And you dropped it?
That's funny!
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
He's just loaded, honey.
Well maybe she better start.
Where did you get the gun?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
They're still there!
What?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
I'm what?  What?
Your father!
I'm here.
I know.  Light a match, will you?
What do you think?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
That's a fine way to behave!
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What's that got to do with it?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
What?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
If he could--
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
"Life is crushing in on me."
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
A what?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
See, we're very modern.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Why?
Are you?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
That one?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Gabriel!
We're talking, aren't we?
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Toys for... adults?
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative five.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
NICK!
You're in on this.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
Not without you.
Nick, the ice is --
You saved me.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
So you could get with my sister.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
More than you know.
Get out.
Nick. I been trying to hit you.
Six men means six guns.
No, you're not.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
OPEN IT!!!
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Aw, Rudy.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
I'm ninety-two years old --
They changed the layout.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
I'll call somebody.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
Pam Grier.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Yeah.
What about?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Sure.
How is he?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
That's your proof?
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't believe in it.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
You do?
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
It's a surprise.
You didn't ask.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Correct.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
That's not correct.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
I got the diamonds.
What?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
You can stay here if you like.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
But the rest is right.
It's going to Sonora.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Goodbye, Mary.
So did I. They were in it.
Why?
I won't again.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Finished, son?
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You want to split up? --
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Then why stay in the hills.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
And you're all alone.
Yeah.
They went on like I told you.
Depends on how good you drive.
I don't like to see you go.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
I was doin' both. Here.
Steve --
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Yes...
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Listen to me I --
I don't care. You pick.
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Right behind you.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Made you say it!
Alright, let's take a vote...
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Are you?
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
The keys. She took the keys.
Just a little experiment.
And sexy.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Thanks, handyman.
Okay, give me my belt.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Because she will lie?
It says, "Ray."
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Jeeezzz!
This is so silly. 
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
That's nice.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
Yes you are.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Listen ——
Then, you also understand that you must die.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
How much have you got?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Hello, Frances.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
What is it?
What were you talking about?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
Yes.
I have something even better.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I'm at sea, Jason.
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
What's wrong, Mary?
I keep telling myself that.
What a peculiar question.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
But why come to me?
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
But you would like to know where she is?
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I'm very, very serious.
I'll be out in a minute.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
Graham Dalton.
Yes.
Well...
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Younger.
Okay, I will!!
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
My therapist said that --
Of course not.
And they just answer them?
To you?
Maybe you want to go.
Then do it.
Yes.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Yes.
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Because.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
You did that?
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I know.
Why?
What do you mean?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
I take it you've never masturbated?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Fine.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Why not?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Cynthia!
You are in trouble.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Nope.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
And that's all?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
No.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
What did he say?
Different.
Is that what he tells you?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
You know what I mean.
Cynthia. John.
No.
What do you mean?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
God, you... you're mean.
It'll just be me.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
No.
My keys?
Yeah.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Didn't seem worried about them.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Yes?
No? How come?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
YOUNG BLOOD
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
Flavors!
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
WHAT A JOKE...
Surely.
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
It'll just take a second.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
What are you pouring tonight?
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
You got it.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
I am one of those guys.
You are not.
I can't help the traffic.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Um... seventy... something.
That's your problem, Miles.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
We should have driven.
So you're going to stop acting?
Pour us a couple.
She is very hot.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Fuck you.
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Nah. I want to watch this.
Okay! Fuck!
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Okay! Jesus!
What?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Yeah.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Huh.
I say we check it out. You never know.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
What?
The plan is... you go.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
I feel like driving.
Yeah.
Back at you.
You were wearing your belt.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Hey.
She got anything good?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, weird. But great.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Yeah.
I had class.
Well, nice to see you now.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
You golf?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Where?
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Only for pee or poop.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
My ballet recital.
Me too.
Good.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Are you going to do this or what?
No I'm not.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Yes.
From what?
I'm close.
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Edgar, come inside.
They tell you everything in this book.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Okay.  So he was tall?
They think it might happen all at once.
What friend is that?
The one with the shotgun.
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
All right then.  Let's go.
Sure.
That's it.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
They've been kind to me.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I had to get up anyway.
I understand.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
And a pretty lady.
I want to build something, make things grow. That takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. That's not why men come to a pretty woman.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Because I'm your sister.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
What's she got to do with it?
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Of course.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Good-bye.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Please.
Why isn't she with you?
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Well, shoot it on the last day.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
When is she coming over?
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
You?
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
So you did meet her?
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
You look so, so...
You don't secretly want the attention?
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Body double.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Somebody said she was here.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
Good for you, Hank.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
There was no other way.
Is she here tonight?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I read.
Night, Lainey.
Abduction?
This should take care of Mother.
My God, you've got one?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I am the death of real.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
That's good.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
No gas... Hey, that's good.
What do you want more than anything?
When?
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
What happened?
No.
They did?
A lady. She died.
I know.
They used to hang people here.
S-ssstop that!
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
What's a "little while?"
Nope.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
...Hi.
...You any good with those?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
"And a slash-slash there --"
Hi Suze.
Harvest moonshining!
Amends...?
Chicken sandwich?
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Name something.
I said that's enough!
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Getting ready.
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Why bother?
Sorry.
Hey, Grant.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
What?
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
How much style?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
An existentialist.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
They're both a challenge.
You just passed your nemesis.
Shoot.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
No what?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
Not for long, you ain't.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
How's your twenty?
That's the point, Dickey.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
Of course. Yes.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
And threw us into the lake.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
Without peer?
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
My debrief --
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
I don't see it like that at all.
You got clicks, anything?
I'm here.
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
You love her?
Like a mafucka.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
How?
What?
Will she come back?
I wish you'd told me.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
No.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Into what?
I love her.
I won't be making the trip.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
What do you mean?
What kind of look?
You don't know?
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Yes.  Yes.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Was she right?
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Yes, you are --
Hello, Win.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
I got money.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Yeah, what a woman.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Yeah.  It was.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
Stop being nuts!
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Do you?
I know.
You're planning to speak?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?!!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Let my kid go.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Mom and I got plans.
I don't think she can sing, either.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
No. No, that's okay.
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
I'm always here, Pete.
I'm parked illegally!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hm.  What a lump.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I got you a present.
Lemme down, bugface!
Mr. Jameson--
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Thank God.
You should write that one down.
Does it have a human name?
I'm sure you kept warm.
So you've found Thorkel?
I'll introduce you.
It'll shut itself off.
Aunt May, what happened?
How is he?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Static!
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
Then droppen Sie dead!
You should live so long.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
He's the grrrrreatest!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You did?
I'll open mine, too.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
No. I want to draw.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
Good.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
What about the radio?
Thirty-fifth.
Are you questioning me?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Not particularly.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
A chicken?
Just don't drool on it.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Full disruptors.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
Can you project its course?
I believe so.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
You get what?
Thanks.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
I hope so, sir.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
What's the "Nexus"?
Oh, of course.
Better?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
I thought you might.
I always do.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Lock phasers and return fire!
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
On screen.
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
It's a little early to celebrate.
... Or <u>who</u>.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
I have already made one transmission too many...
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
I still don't...
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
None that I can detect, sir.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Goodbye, David.
Yes. And I know you.
The ship... Out of danger...?
Count on our help, sir.
... A cloaking device?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
About a dozen officers and men.
Close... There --
Come on!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Then, how --
Of course...!
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Sir, may I --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Ah.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday.
Maybe...
Who --
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
What?
It was just words.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Visual --
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
I shall avenge you --
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Admiral, this is Spock.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Be careful, Jim...
Yes, sir.
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
There is no such regulation.
They just don't want us going in there.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Just a couple of kooks...
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Gillian --
Please...
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
We've done it before.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Cramps.
... My shoes...
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
You play games with me and you're through
I was not.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Then --
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Hm?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
You need me.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
How do you know this...?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
How will playing cards help?
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Then... Where the hell are we?
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Picture, please.
Aye, sir!
On speakers.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Full power, sir.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
I am well, Admiral.
Millions?
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Sulu Hikaru.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
Why?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
Will it?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
You're what?
No one's ever asked me that before.
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
How about a passive radiation scan?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Another time.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
... had regenerated.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
You got me, Commander.
Options?
Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
Why not?
Eighteen minutes...
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
You've not aged a day since then?
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Make it so.
We have to find shelter...
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Whatever makes you comfortable...
You're in quite a mood today.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
You think they're still up there?
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I... do not want this...
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
No.
Do it.
Ready quantum torpedo.
Where's the Sphere?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Understood. Keep me informed.
How serious is the damage?
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
I'm very sorry.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Some.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Fire.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Admiral Donald...Bill...
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.
We're not finished.
Specifically of...?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Now there's a poser.
Then let me help!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
He just tried to save him!
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
But I am not human. I am only -
Such things have happened before, sir.
An omission. After that -
You having hearing problems, mister?
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
I know precisely where he'll be.
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the “Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the “Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat…
No.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There’s no crying in Starfleet.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
It'll only work for one of us.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
With pleasure, Captain.
Theories?
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
That's an order, Commander.
Aye, sir.
I'll take care of it, sir.
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Still well on our side...
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me.  I’ll be in the gym.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
Anything.
No race should be a slave to another.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
In time.
Why am I here?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
You know that's not possible.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
They're holding position.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
How much are your rooms?
We should have. Let me see.
What do you do?
Elmo's...
They must have picked it up in space.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's in a green Mustang?
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Which way do you want to go?
Coupons.
From?
Shit?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
I do not understand.
I do not speak English.
You want this ticket?
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
Yes?
What is hell?
He will.
I am your friend.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
Hurry up.
You can have one.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Nothing.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
I know how to gamble now.
What will you say about us?
Hey buddy... let her go...
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Fly.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
I did.
The police think he was high on drugs...
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
Just not the eyes.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
No problem.
A star is born.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Make me forget it, baby.
No, Lenny.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Can't do it.
We should talk alone.
Least you can do.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Your existence.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
She's my destiny.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
So the guy's not a sicko.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Sure.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
You never told me.
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Take the tape to the cops.
You really want that on your head?
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Anybody talk to the press?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Winona.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What do you want from me?
He had an orange hat on.
What's with the eyelids?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Another what?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Then why do I still have a badge?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I don't believe this.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I was looking for a pattern.
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
Dick Low's a killer too.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
It explains a lot.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
This is some serious shit.
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
You did.
Then there's the other issue.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
You were right. He found me.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Kulok.
Yes, sir.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
It was the mall.
Those were just fantasies.
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
If I owe, I will go.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[What does the file say?]
Yes, sir.
Sounds like fun.
I screwed up twice, sir.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Take your shirt off.
You're money, baby.
What kind of car do you drive?
What's that like?
Nikki.
Not lately.
Tell me about it...
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
How?
Anything?
Anything.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
...not until you book it...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
No.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Why not?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Yeah. And an actor.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Yeah, hold on.
I can call back...
Fine... I guess. You?
What kind of things?
Right.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
What do you want? You're tall.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
Kinda.
I didn't mention her once today.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Classy.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
I'll be your winger.
Well, you're doing so well...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Damned if I know...
Mike?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
S'up Trent?
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
You're crazy.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
They're all skanks.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
You gotta do it.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
That's bullshit.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
I gotta use the phone.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
What?!?
I hear she's getting real fat.
You looked right at her, baby.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
...How novel.
Is she looking now?
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...Shut up, Sue...
...just be smart about it.
Yes. 
The Court gave you justice.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
How bad will it be?
Maybe less...
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
When did he call?
But you needed a drink first.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
How?
Good.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
You want him to stay in this country.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Give them some money and send them home.
Get rid of them...
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Mama, no.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
They're talking to themselves.
Al Capone!
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
I'm thinking about it.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Huh?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Probably a year...
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
Be patient.
You think I scam?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Sure. Any time.
Shut up!
Shut up.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
That's funny.
Sure.
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
What?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
What?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Hardly.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
So I'm learning.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I'll go.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
You were going to Venice.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Get on. I'll take you to him.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Hello Marge!
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't believe you.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
I told you! I knew it!
How would you know that?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Right.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
You know what -- I am.
It's fantastic.  I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
It's okay.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Or I could come back.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Why lie?
Well that would be even better gossip.
You're such a liar...
...Tom is a mystery...
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
What about Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Tomorrow.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
Is there a firing range around?
Huh?
Thank you, Travis.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
It keeps ya busy.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
My God!
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
What taxi driver?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
For a fee.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
I can leave anytime I want.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Where is home?
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
How?
Have you tried the telephone?
No.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
How's your driving record?
So I hear.
Anything you say, officer.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Real down.
It happens.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Don't let him do that.
Wait.  Where're you going?
Now they only have three rockets left.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I did?  Huh!
Whoa.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Well, there's got to be a way...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Oh.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
But what?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
When did I leave?
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
Ha!
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Then I'll call you a cab.
We live in a theater?
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Huh?
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I taught you that.
No, I...
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Of course.
I thought you...
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
No.  Absolutely not.
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Thank you.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
I despise it.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
Then what was it?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Could I have a puff?
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
The little Brenner girl.
I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, but where?
Yep?
Yes.
It's nothing.
Shall I call the doctor?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Lovebirds, I see.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Where will we go?
I started to say... inside...
No, not exactly.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
What good will they do?
Cathy. At the school.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I wish I could be that way.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
We know what it is, Al.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Some of them are.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
Hey, wait a minute!
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
We... we went to school together. College.
Without any clothes on?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.
You were lying.
Yes.
Why?
Why?
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Yes.
Are you staying?
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Hear!
It was like that yesterday.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
How?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Not if they're starting a war.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
I want you to help my little girl.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Pulse?
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
He was a nice horse.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
I can't.
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Don't call me that confounded name.
You will not have it?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Why don't you do it then?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
I've had some experience.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
Any attacks of pain since?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
No great lady will ever take my place?
Where are they?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
What do they do that they had to kill her?
The strip joint?
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I think we should get some support?
What? Call the police?
Keep that thing away from me.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
Good thing in a situation like this.
The scar.
Nobody.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Have to find him first.
It's not. I can't take it.
Good for you. You do know something.
I mean Lauren.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I don't believe you.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
No -- not at all.
That can easily be arranged.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Professor Barnhardt.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
May I see you for a minute?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You don't.
They would have killed this man?
How long will that take?
Yeah.
Fine!  Stay here!
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
That's just the way we like it.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
I can't do that!
How do you know they're not?
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
For everything.
Gotta go, Mom.
What's that smell?
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Lucy.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Did you want to talk to me?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Okay.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Huh?
I was here first.
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What about Mom?
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I know.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
Cool it, Palmer!!
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
You lying bastard...
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
It's shorted out or something!
Well, go on.
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Neither will we.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
All in Norwegian.
Thank you.
A serum test possibly.
A day or so ago... I guess.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
When do you think it got to him?
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
The Hall of Books.
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
How did you know?!
Do you know where they live?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
How have you survived so long?
What?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
You took her because she helped me.
I'm a foolish man.
And why not?
Because...
All right, what is it now?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
I mean... well... affection.
You're getting warmer.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Perseverance.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I care more about my life.  And yours.
I would.
Good night, Alex.
I don't understand.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
That machine --
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
I don't understand.
Well, we're happy you're here. Come inside.
New Yorkers.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Yes, sir.
Kalen...
That's quite enough, Kalen.
And you've no idea where he went?
No, sir.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I don't understand...
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
After I...
What?
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
There're no cars on this street.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
The future doesn't look different?
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
What are you talking about?
[Beat] How do you know?
So what am I supposed to do?
Is it true?
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
[Beat] Why?
You want anything special for dinner?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
In the leg.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
How are things goin' out there?
Stop.
Shut up.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Who's your friend?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Ready when you are.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
You're not touchin' that car.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Will I be?
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
Thelma kinda took to him.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
It won't work.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
I can see that.
What?!  What about him?!
Now, Thelma, that is not...
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
You do?
Yeah.
Eeuww.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can change our names.
Yup.
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
We're fine!  How are you?
No, I just meant...
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Well once. Mary.
I mean since then.
I don't know.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Amen to that.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Got cash.
Mints?
Hm?
Huh.
'That right?
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Stalker, huh?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
No I can't.
Am I?
Who the fuck is it to you?
No thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
By the way, what's your name?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
That sounds like fun.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
-- Love story of our time.
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
What?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
You mean him.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Nice.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
You mean he's not a criminal?
The prom -- you going?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh yeah.
He's dead.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh great, I ran out.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
All right, let's go.
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Giddy-up.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
What if I can't?
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
I want an hour with him.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Dean Rusk!
I, uh...
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Yeah, a good political solution.
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Don't get too attached.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
-- a fucking cop.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
I got one up on ya.
Cooch. You're my hero.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Thanks, Cooch.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
Because he was talking to me.
He saw an owl.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
She's your sister?
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Ray --
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
What are you talking about?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Nothin'. Forget it.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
And on to a bigger one with you?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
And far too aggressive.
Yes. I'll give you that!
How about what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Winston Churchill.
What?
You always get what you want?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
That's what I want.
What truth?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
He's pissing me off!
Were upside down!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Yawing right.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Well what?
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I've had enough...for now.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Time to go.
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
The girl with the purple fingernails?
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
SHIT!!
IT'S MY SHOT.
You saved our lives. You did it!
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Me?
Sir?
The wings..
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
I'd advise you to hurry.
So why am I still alive?
Perfect, my ass!  --You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  Then Richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning. --Frankly, I'm amazed is worked.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
That's right.
Not since you lost him.
How was your trip to Mars?
What are you, my father?
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
I've got Quaid.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Move to Mars.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't even remember me.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Get out!
Aliens?!
I gave you?
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Do not talk to the driver.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
Adios, bridge!
A man who plans ahead.
Great.  Thank you.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Only if something happens to me.
Civil?  I'm civil.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
You bet.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
It's...gone...!
Could be.
Yeah, geography.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Let go of my hair.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Can't I take a simple piss without --
I specialize, Roger...
-- a speed manufacturer --
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
I feel much better now.
-- What?
That's why I hate experts.
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
I embroidered.
But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
You don't drink "booze".
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
That's right.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
Shouldn't one of us...?
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
-- What trial?
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Soldado.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Thank you, Carl.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Okay, Gordon!!!
ALBERT?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Ever see her with someone else?
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
I don't know, Sam.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
Thanks.
I don't know what to do.
Well, why not?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
No.
What can I tell you?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Did you make me a tape?
We're on our way, Baby.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
What's going on?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
What?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Mom, take it easy.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
No.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Just as you are, Sir...
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
We just...
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
'Code Blue'...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
...that's perfectly all right.
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You live in the neighborhood?
Who told you that?
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Defense...?
Are you done?
Exception!
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
And what are you? A cop?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
And are they going to get it?
You're going to stay here...?
You, you don't under...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...now who is that...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
...Gruber's not bad.
Today is Tuesday. What?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Yeah.
The broad has disappeared...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got to talk.
I don't know.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
How'm I doing so far?
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
Where are we?
Don't let's lose each other.
Have you got a pocket compass?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Looks like the fishing was good.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
You get any sleep last night?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase. Hi...
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Absolutely.
Is he all right?
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
You have a fever, sweetie?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
When do you think it'll be done?
You didn't jump in.
Yeah, sure.
The car's no there yet?
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Uh...sure...when?
You miss him.
Guilty.
I can take it.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
What do you mean?
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
What?
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
What about you?
What?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Like this!
Fine.
My dad.
Unfurl the squares!
Close the door.  Sit down.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Take good care of my son.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
Yes sir.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
Long enough.
You've gotta be kidding?
I can't.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Fuck me.
What's that?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
Whattaya do there?
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
That bastard Pucinski...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
What brand'd she smoke?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
What happened to him?
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Come look at this.
It's just another case, Sailor.
I do.
What was this one?
You do.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
We'll find out in a hurry.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Under a hundred.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
One bad car accident...
Let's get outta here, honey.
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Went with Bobby.
I mean tomorrow.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
What if I asked you not to?
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Yes.
On one condition...
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Where we goin'?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
By who?
I didn't see nothin'...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
You're stoned.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
The hood jumper?
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
He was never able to reproduce them.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Excuse me?
You did.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
I've been trying to finish a book...
Her dog, yes.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
It's not bad.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Who?
What'd you tell him?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Yeah, well, actually...
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Kinship.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I'm a little worried, James.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Simple.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
This is important.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Oh... yeah.
Sick.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Just kidding.
I might have his number on campus.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
C'mon, Walter.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
Try.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
I have to go.
Not yet.
Why don't you just tell me?
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
Do you believe in them?
The one with the ax?
No.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
Can I ask how old you are?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
Yes.
How do you know?
That was a joke.
Ev-i-dence.
You think reflection is good.
How's that?
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I couldn't say.
I don't.
What is your idea of being normal?
I want to be normal!
Is this the first one?
That's not a helpful answer.
Why?
I don't see --
Not so fast.
In my bed too.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
So... what's your dark secret?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
It's been a while since...
How about in the morning.
I suffer from insomnia.
It's not what you think.
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Yes! I want to know.
Why young girls, Walter?
You really believe that?
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
No you don't.
What?
I'm not scared.
Just think about it.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Yeah.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
No way that could just be seawater.
How deep's the drop-off here?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Fine.  Be that way.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
No.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Calm down, Bud.
Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Copy that.
How many are there?
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
A little more so this time.
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
That must be Basiluzzo.
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Have you decided?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
And what about you?
Are you joking?
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
Okay. In a few minutes.
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Late, very late.
I love you.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Have you ever been in love?
Do you consider that a compliment?
What do you mean by sensible?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
We'll try again.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Ask her.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Why don't you try?
What other boat?
And what did they say about me?
No, not like this one.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Lady Patrizia!
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I'm a blimp.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
I'm not hungry.
Yes Mother.
Say it!
Anything... may I sit down?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
No. I was sick.
Then let's talk about something else...
Why do you smoke?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Where did you go?
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
Because I don't want one.
A mistake...
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
No...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
And then...
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Are you pretty?
I had a baby.
Because I wasn't worthy.
Why?
Sister Marguerite I think.
What else?
What do you feel?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
How did she know about him?
Where?
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
I don't remember.
Yes.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Sister...
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
Something they... that they overlooked.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I'll have a decision by next week.
No!
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Who told you this?
Unfiltered.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
That's ridiculous...
I've already told you what I thought.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
About two years before.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Aquittal.
Answers.
Sister Paul?
And Agnes' father?
She molested her!
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Peter?
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
My God, but you're determined.
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
Before or after you killed the child?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
They are?
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Just you?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
I've made the scene.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
It is, y'know.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
He's sulking again.
He hasn't.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Are you pulling my leg?
Yes.
Oh aye, a sledge.
What are you?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Parading's better!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Nothing good.
Is there a fire, then?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
What little old man?
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Don't be callous.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Y'what?
He started it.
Aye, well, now! 
Well, you look like him.
Is it?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Aye, I suppose so.
Sorry.
Good lad, Ringo.
But...
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Cattle ranch!
Kill drive engines.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
A transmission?
I am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hard to say.
Shit...
Here, let me try.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
I can't, the acid will pour out!
I'm trying.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
No, it's coming.
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
We're coming!
... More spores coming.
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Do you want a tablet?
Too many.
We're not gonna make it, are we?
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Just got a reading...
I'll come with you.
Just behind us, over to the right.
Okay.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Uh-huh.
What is that?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Is that a fact.
Four.
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Don't wait for me!
I... I can't!
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
I call myself Phoebe.
Please do.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Eddie what?
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
D-day.
Why'd call me a killer?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
You're being childish.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
I was there. An eyewitness.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
We have that in common.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Huh?
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Call me when you get in...
You in a hurry?
Sing it?
I get a party, don't I?
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
I had no idea you were even here.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I wish it were.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
What would you like? Texas?
I just wondered.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
You're quite a girl.
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Do you want an argument or an answer?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
What are you doing here?
You probably won't believe me.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
Oh, no...
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Hollywood.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
I don't intend to be.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Thank you, Karen.
'Remembrance'.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Isn't that what they always say?
I just can't believe it.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
I can't believe Eve said those things!
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Incredible.
Don't joke about such things.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
How do you mean?
I'm sure.
To you, too?
I never said it was!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I have no intention of having an accident!
That's right, but I don't understand-
"Liebestraum."
I didn't hear you.
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."  And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper."  Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
--we will--
--I know, I know--
--has he got an ax?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
It's nothing personal, though. 
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
I've got a lot of energy.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--there's nothing new in it--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--what do you think?--
Electronic surveillance.
Look, I told you inside--
Are you implying you don't believe me?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
...check...?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
James McCord.
I think so.
I really want to know.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
--remember Toronto, Harry.
I won't talk about the other two.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Uh-huh.
Just go!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
You can't sing at the competition.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
Please.
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Sure.
What?
No you haven't.
Do you?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Yeah, that's right.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
But --
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
That's stupid.
He's going in!
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
I told you.
Okay, I get it.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
I suppose that would be okay.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
God dammit, Stifler!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
Okay, don't stop.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah, right here.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Shut the fuck up.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
No shit.
Doing what?
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Are you okay?
Andy! No!
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Yeah. French fries...
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Now!
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Who's Sophie?
You must have.
I shant!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Who are you?!
I have my reasons.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
Pray he's color-blind...
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
This guy's on television.
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
Alvy Singer over here!
M'mm.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Oooh! Here! Here!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Yeah.
Nice car.
Oh.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'll see yuh.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Those are the two categories...
And blind people, crippled...
Oh, yeah.
That's the key question.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Of course.
Mine.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
No, I'm fine.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
M'm.
M'hm.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
Oh.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
I don't know.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Nothing at all?
I'm cool.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Remember that day?
Yeah.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You're mad, aren't you?
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Bad?
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
It's a narrow view.
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Oh, do yuh?
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
You'll total the whole car.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Well, sit down.
You all right?
Where?
SO?
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
...of possibly working together.
Oh.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Oh yes.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I'd say it was down.
Never.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Oh my God, the sitter.
Yeah.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Leave us alone right now.
And you know our friends, how?
Nice to meet you.
Forget it, Judy.
I love you, you're a genius.
Whatever you say.
You want me to uninvite her?
I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Otis!!!!
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
What are you saying?
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
You don't have to.
Lovely.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
Don't I find what?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I meant Sally.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's a lot of those.
Come here.
You're not serious.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Oh?
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
She's all over him, are you blind?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Fuck you, Panes.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Well, something's wrong.
Um.  Happy for you.
Yes, you're a monster.
You don't need to thank me.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
So how much do you hate her?
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Wanna dance?
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Yes.
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
I order you to find out where we are!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Look around, sweetheart.
Stop fooling around in there.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Of course --
Barbatus?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Affirmative.
So...you two are in love?
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
I'll be back.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Oh!
It's a bet.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Fine.  Wait.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
No. Like a man.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
I'll fix you some coffee.
In his apartment.
Baxter.
Miss. 
He doesn't give a damn about me.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Too slow?
You are?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Would you mind opening the window?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Here.
In the knee?
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I'm fine all over.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
How do you work it with the key?
I'm not through with you yet.
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Yes, of course.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Sir?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Don't mind what?
No I didn't.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Now will you get out?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Let me get my bag.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Something like that.
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Sure, Doc.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Not particularly.
My shoes.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
I never said goodbye, Fran.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Yeah.
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Fat. That's real fat.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
How long were you up there ?
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Why they call you that?
No shit.
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
We're Americans.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
Yeah -- like keep out --
What is it?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
We ain't goin' down the river.
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
What?
Wh -- what?
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Who knows.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
Yeah, I like it...
How's the pain?
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
I think think a lie stinks.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
Yes...
And you admired him?
Which one's the Colonel's?
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
You think he'd of shot us?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Why did they attack us?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
You're Australian?
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
No. Not really.
What things?
Yes.
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
C'mon --
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
168  CONTINUED:
I don't want to talk any more.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
-- Corbett's a killer.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Where's Corbett?
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
It's a spring day...
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
Don't bet on it.

Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
No, I better stay at my post.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Sure.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Go ahead.
I love you.
Since forever.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
No.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Okay.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
Sex with Simon?
This one has a special meaning.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
You know what? I...
Uh-huh...
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
I just love her.  How're you doing?
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
What?
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Well, I can't reach them.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
Got any easier questions?
Yeah...
Never a break. Never.
You consider your life easy.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
Just a second -- he has to go.
Right.
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
No fucking way.
We both know what you were doing.
Tachlinkov.
I know you're going to jump.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
The contract?
$1,000,000.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Yes.
Yes.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
Why?
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Because I'm done.
Why not?
I was just different.
But you knew what they were training you for?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Because I want to know.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother you?
You were there?
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
How was the beach?
Check.
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
What?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Ten years ago.
They're worth less points.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
Why?
No.
I'm not normal.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
A pleasure doing business with you.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
Honesty.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
It's possible.
Anything.
You mean quit?
No.
That's correct.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
He was an electrician?
So?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Well, don't get carried away.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Like helping a sick kid?
Close!
We're going to need it all.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Holly!
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
They ain't the only ones.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Lucky break!
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Siberia.
Here!
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
What are you talking about?
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
Yeah!
Doug?
So am I.
Yes.
No!
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
You're everything a guy could want.
Let's have a look anyway.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Great. And your all set for the performance?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Well she sure isn't normal.
No, just a coffee.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Cool!
And you broke into that room?
Fuck you!
Not all of them!
Yeah.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
Some Americans?
And what of these foreigners?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
I. Don't. Dance.
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
About a job.
-- I like the car I have.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
Thanks.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Me neither.
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
I didn't know either.
Landon --
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
I don't want to have any conversation.
Because that's where the fire is?
Good thing.
Know so.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
You don't believe in anything?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Your father doesn't like me.
You don't miss a thing.
That sounds like horseshit.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
Fun.
Where's the one you're building?
What about your father?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Tired.
Lower. Same page.
Better. I was really angry.
Up to?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
It's time to tell him.  It would be the right thing.
That won't be possible.
So talk to us about something.
Either. Both.
How -- how long does she have?
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
I'm no dummy.
Please.
Then you remember more than I do.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Thank you.
Scalene?
That's good.
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
Poly-what?
Uh, hi....
Not now....
Huh?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
What?
Nineteen fifty --
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
So what? We'd be rich!
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
That's just great!
Professor, be serious, would you?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Okay.
Does he bite?
Good luck to you.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Sure.
Why not?
It's your play.
Yeah.
Don't ask me.
But it would hurt.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I don't know.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
It's mine all right.
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Not me. No way.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
She wants a picture.
It?  Who does?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
To get my guns.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
You don't wanna know.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
A what?
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
Bet I do.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Hello.
...Who is this?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Bill –
Well... actually, no Bill...
Are you all right?
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
He's a great writer –
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
What do you mean, Barton?
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Well, we've got something in common then.
Charlie. How are you.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Well...
So they say.
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
Excuse me?
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
All of which he's now missin'.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
Thanks.
No.
You don't look so okay.
Sometimes I really hate you.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
What was she like in school?
Tell me about Catherine.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
If that's the way you want to play it.
Only when they make interesting reading.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
She wiped out her whole family.
No.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
I'll risk it.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I don't have a choice.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
I'll convince you.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
What are you researching?
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why?
Sometimes.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
Routine.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
You don't like punk rockers?
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Why not?
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Yeah.  I know.
I said keep it.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
Can there be some mistake?
He was shot.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
It's in New Jersey.
Ten bucks apiece.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
Aren't they?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
Staten Island would be ok.
What's wrong with me?
George?
It's three thousand dollars!
Would you check out my studio some time?
No, I'd like the scarf.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
I just don't think you're being fair.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I will relay the message.
You'll never guess.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Nor I, on the second.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Your blood, Max.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
... eight, seven...
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I don't.  So, no.
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Specify, please.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Why?
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Can he save her?
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
From the other side of the equator-
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Like hell you do.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
She wants to kill you.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
I've got to stop him.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
No. You said I. I killed them.
Don't be ridiculous.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
He ran away?
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Tonight's a good night.
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Slanta.
Banzai.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Wacko? That a technical term?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I don't-.
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
Bruce, you can't.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
A man with a death wish.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
... Where are you calling from?
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Great. How??
Holy shit. Holy...
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Right first time.
Thanks, Annie.
Excuse me.
Ahm.... .
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
off the peg?
I am sorry you feel that way.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Me first! Me first!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Cool, huh huh.
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
What's your problem Beavis?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-dumpling...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Really? I poop too much.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
That's better. Yes?
D.C., Chief.
Who knows?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Oh... I'm sorry...
What?
That's how long you were gone.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
No, I'm not putting up with this.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
He might have hurt somebody.
What makes you think she likes me?
We're ghosts.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
Now, let's get rolling!
We tried.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
I want to be dead too.
Where'd they go?
Yeah.
Just <u>say</u> it.

I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Maybe Charles does.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
Oh. I have a message for him.
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Oh, yes.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Hello, Dennis.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Hello, Sid.
Hello, Morton.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
I certainly do.
Thank you.
... I see.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
I understand.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
I can't read.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
... How long have you been living here?
No.
How were you paid?
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
1952...?
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Oh, really...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
You heard?
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Hello, Sophie.
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Right, Chief.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Oh? What?
Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
You take care too, Bobby.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
The monkey.
May 11th.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hmmm.
Hmmm.
Just an idea I had.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I'm scared.
We'll talk about it in the car.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
You've always hated the animals.
What's that?
Yes.
I'm a puppeteer.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
It's Elijah.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
No. I understand perfectly.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
I wouldn't know.
I'm right?
Maxine.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Good morning, Lotte!
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
I love you, Lotte.
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
One hour.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Who needs dancing?
Oh, Lotte...
What the fuck is going on?
Lotte called me.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Sleepy suddenly.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Say the Word!
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
and she is mine...
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
What you want'em for?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
She likes this dress...
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
No use thinking these things now.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Yeah. Look bad?
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
You got to get up from here, girl.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Why me, man?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Fuck you.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
Huh?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
It's already posted.
Am I wrong?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
I've had a--
He's handicapped, huh?
No, they--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Heh-heh--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Oh, no.
Yeah, but what about--
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Oh?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
I want a child.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
Huh?
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
It's your roll--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
What the fuck is going on there?
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Thanks Walter.
Now Dude--
Uh-huh.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
This driveway.
Wha.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
WHAT?!
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Fry 'em.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
I want to see the sun rise.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
I'll show you.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Blood...
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
You experimented on your own, son?
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Are we bringing home strays now?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
He didn't. Get over it.
What do you see here?
Cancer.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
I was afraid that might happen.
Deacon brought me back.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
Perhaps.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
You.
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Oh, sorry, right.
--Nick!!
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
No--<u>this</u> is weird.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Your body, your call.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
Get your goddamn--
I can't.
Then I'm going--
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
The, uh, blur there.
--no, I think they're all in there.
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Shut-up.
No.
Butt-ugly owl.
Just go.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
--who?
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
The wheel.
--now there.
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
I can't!
Ah, Domini?
What?
Then I have no idea.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Elly Kedward?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Domini.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
--it's urgent!
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
See a guy.
...Huh?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Ray--
All right...
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Yeah...
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
You're an idiot.
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I'm not sick.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Oh yeah, that's good.
No. Come on.
I . I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
See my breasts?  . See?
No. please. I won't.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
That's good.
Sure I do.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You called me Jeffrey.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Good, let's drink up.
Am I bothering you?
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Maybe so.
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Two.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
What did you see?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Okay.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
... Sandy?.
Go ahead!
What?
Alright.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Where do you guys want to count?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
Yeah.  I am.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
No fucking way.
Get me a six pack.
Murder.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
What's the other one?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Just a friend.
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
I did not.
Today.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Mom.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Power?
Keep them coming.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Diego?
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I know.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
What about him?
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Out.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah.
No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
What?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
I didn't mean to...
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
They're over at the booth.
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I wish there was shit like this back home.
That's right.
It depends on you.
Second name.
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
Let's try ...
I think it'll be a success ...
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
But it's not even midnight yet!
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Let's hope forever.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
Why?
Did I say it was a natural death?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
But there's more?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
No.
Sex.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Why would she want that?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
How long were you together?
And how are you now?
Why do you think she left you?
What did she say?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
-- And what did you suggest?
Yes.
No further questions.
Yes -- he did.
Yes -- cocaine.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Why didn't you live together?
Sure.  Where to?
Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
No -- I'm a survivor.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
I can think of worse ways to go--
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
We have to talk.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Where have you been?
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Not even if they're a dork?
Daddy -- stop it!
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
No -- never.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Why are there two deeds here?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
That's it!
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Nobody did.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
That's it.
Maybe it's because I live here.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
How long you been married?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Want another cigarette?
Why?
Clean?
Oh you!
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Why did you stop?
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
You get used to it.
Yes.
I told you, I love other people.
I would love to come for dinner.
Wonderful. Uh...
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
I sat outside and had coffee.
Trouble. Why?
What?
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, what is this?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
What makes it different, Robert?
Then he can move! People move!
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Yes. And I've accepted.
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Betty.
What happened?
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
How the hell should I know?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
What the hell you talking about?
Go for it.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Let me see your hand.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Where we'll always be...
We met.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
It was just like in my head.
Potential toxic dump site.
Moe's terms.
Ours!
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Evidence of what?
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
Here, put this in his mouth.
Know what?
Give it to me.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
Why?
It was him.  I'm positive.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
The hell I can't!
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Not until he has the money!
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
You murdered Gino!
Good boy.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Five.
I could be lying.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Yeah.
Good guess.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Yeah.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
He's a launderer?
Nothing.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
Work.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
What choice?
How much money?
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
Then what?  Exactly.
Good.
Who is Gino?
...  shit.
Yeah.
Any bodyguards?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
...  Me neither.
Pop?
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
I know you will.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?  Get away from all of this.
I thought you were never going to do that.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
I think so.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
-- sir? --
One moment, sir.
Who?  Who came?
I need a ride out of here.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I don't know.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
But the police --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- here we go -- I found it --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
Hang on... 
Enhance it.
-- he accessed the account --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
Where am I?
I don't know.
...aven't you?
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
In fact, killing people -
Well ... well, I ...
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
You are late.
Yes, thanks.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
They weren't at school with us.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Yes we have, Jack!
Shut up!
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Where do I get it stamped?
Ah.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Well, all wars do -
Every day?
What?
Who will?
Will you please turn back.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Leave me alone!
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
Don't do anything silly.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Would you really, Sam?
What a BITCH!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
What?
You want to take my console into your office?
A woman eh? I see.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
You remember Samuel, my son.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Not ... as such ...
Who fixed your ducts?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Yes.
He's dead, huh?
He's working a double shift.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
Okay.
How long you been doing this?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
No, no.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
What look?
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
The brakes are shot.
I've taken that into consideration.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Let me think.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
You write this?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Fifty, right?
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
No.  Don't worry about it.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Yes.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Call if you get weird.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Good.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Do others feel that you did well?
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
No.  You know that I'm not.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Yeah --
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
Thanks.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Bobbie, please.
Follow me.
You talked me into it.
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
What?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
It's not opinion.
That actually goes on...
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Excited.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Where are you?
Well, when?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
A picnic?
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Right back to you.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Righto.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Oh...
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Hm.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I wouldn't give up your day job.
I'm totally serious!
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
I admit it.
Why not?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
Now what kind of statue was that?
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Got carried away, huh?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
I can't talk right now.
Uh, hi.
You can cut the crap.
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Uh, I don't know.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
You don't have to do anything!
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
If you see him.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
Andy!
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Don't tread on the earth?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Mmmnkay.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
I think you've forgotten something.
It could happen.
You want some water or something?
You sure?
Yeah?
For the dance.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Get away from me!
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
) What do you think?
Well, where?
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Why?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
China.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Same one.
Fine.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
Good enough!
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Later for it.
Why?  Why me?
I'm just a girl.
You think so?
Okay.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Right.
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Catch?
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
A little better.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
I know what it is.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
it's okay..
You don't have to...
--but you're father's in there!
How can I possibly thank you?
I got lured.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
You're pulling your hips out.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Aren't we all?
He won't make love to me anymore.
You okay?
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
He looks great, just great!
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Naw...
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
You're a great catcher.
Forget it.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Yeah, thanks for everything.
And where can I go?
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a miracle.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You were wandering around.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
I can't do that.
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Oh, good.
I can't! I'm tied!
Wh-wh -
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Somethin', huh?
No, of course not.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
What?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Nope, there's no way.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
All right.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
Okay?
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
No, a...
Why?
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
What are you -
Yeah.
She was afraid to call you.
Well...
Well...
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Seven o'clock.
And they were usually right.
Good to meet you.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...and she doesn't always -
Nice to see you, Senator.
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You sure?
Oh...
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
Okay, okay.
What's it...
It's under...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
You're not takin' Amy.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Oh...
Fuck you.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Get - get up!
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels.
I really think you're -
So, you're a righty?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Hi. Good.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Sam?
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Please.
Can I go in?
Okay.
I'm over here now.
Fine, fine.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Of course, Remo.
Hi, how are you?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Am I right?
What? What?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Hm.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Sure did.
Everything went to his head. 
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
Yeah. Uh-huh -
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
All right.
Why?
I took care of everybody.
Hey, Shelly. 
It's up to you.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Take it easy!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you!
Charlie M?
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
You're a little confused?
Denying?
I know, but that's enough.
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
I wonder..
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Are you sure?
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
What do you want from me?
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
And...your point?
I still have one left...
You've seen me...
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Taking messages.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Theo wants to talk again.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
You gotta just look the other way.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
I improved on the fucking original.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
Who smashed the phone?
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
My name is --
Don't lay this on me!
What makes you say that?
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
A woman?
Hey drop it, okay?
And that was the end of it?
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I can hear you again, clearly.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What do you mean?
Do you know what's in that box?
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
No.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
The guy with the transplant.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
Do you have to point that?
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
A typical fuck-up.
You, I would've noticed.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Stop talking like that!
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Did you hear that?
What's Nels' number?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
They did some great job of reforming you.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
You're up on your details, aren't you?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Got a phone in that van?
Talk to the man.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
My pleasure --
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Negative.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
We're gonna get there first.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
Who are you?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
What you think?
Maybe.
Cunt.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
He wants to know do I mean that.
What?
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Scottish?
Not me.
What look?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Whiskey.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
How different?
Maybe.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Did he dance with you?
Yeah.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Apologies, my sweet.
Sure I do.
No. Can't pretend that much.
You'd do anything for me?
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
No! I'm going home...
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
No.
You didn't.
Stop it, Dil --
Got to be somewhere.
Let them come then.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
What happened to Jimmy?
Can't remember...
Fergus.
You know her, Jimmy?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Do you want some food?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
So you did fuck up.
And what happens then?
You may be right.
Who's the old geezer?
It's your decision.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I know that.
I understand.
And who is she?
Good.
So it's on the street.
So, what do I look like?
My pleasure.
Only joking.
They won't let him die.
Don't I know it.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
The fastest.
How different?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Like what?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
What does that mean?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
Hurling --
Thought you liked me, bitch.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
That's right.
No -- I guess not.
What?
What about it?
It's lovely.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
No thanks.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
His -- real -- ?
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Ours.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
May I have a cigarette, please?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
Starting with his own.
Brian.
No.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Your --
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Who told you to do that?
I'll be right there.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Maybe.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Are you going to listen?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
And if it is?
Why bother him?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
I don't know anything.
I'm very cold.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I don't know.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Shakespeare never said that.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
Starting tonight?
What?
Be careful, Peter.
A quarter of a million dollars.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
How can you tell?
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
What's he up to?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
He took care of Charlie for us.
Who invited you?
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
How much further?
No I wasn't.
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Who's?
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I'm fine.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Yeah. Who is she?
What?
And the police did nothing?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Just thinking about something.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
So are you.
No.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
You're being unfair.
Unfair?!
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
...that is going to explode...
Where do you want this stuff?
No argument there.
Since today.  New policy.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
That'll make up the difference, huh?

No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...

You are not takin' my truck!

That dog was mean before I met him.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.
That's...
You're nuts, goin' back there!


Kiss my ass!
...-er!
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
Oh, shit.
...Shift.
I don't think we have much of a choice...

Oh, shit.
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
...Pete!  Come on.
...you crazy bastard.
 ...shit!
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
 Okay.  Okay. 
All right, let's go.
I'm a dangerous man!
He's crazy!

Oh, shit.

...-tion?
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
We got two paddles.

 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
What?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.

Come here.
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Okay.
Forty-nine point four.

...-ta get outta here!
Let's go!

Always the negative...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Hello.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
I was undercover as a tennis player.
...within five minutes.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Vaughn.
I did what I could for you...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...help you?
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...

Any of them Richard Long?
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
No!
No!
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Almost quaint.
And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Closin' down, sir.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/LONG'S OFFICE - NIGHT.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/STORAGE AREA/FREEZER VAULT - NIGHT.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - DAY.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Right.  Tim Mason.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Mornin'.
Not tonight...
I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
You try anything, it goes in...

It won't be long, gentlemen.
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
All right, let's move...
Negative.  Negative.
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
It could be a cover, I suppose.
...try this one out some-...
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...is death.
...fishin'.
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Just go check the temperature.
 
All right, go.

INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAY. 
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
'Course you do, Jake.
If that's what it says.
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
My daughter.
What about her?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Just find the girl.
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Ain't worth thinking about.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Curly, where's your car?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
How'd you get past the guards?
You're welcome to try. There he is.
What pictures?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Where?
Gittes, stay outta this.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Please call first.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Mr. Gittes.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
I don't believe you.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Working for the District Attorney.
Where are you going?
It has to do with my father.
The police?
What does it look like?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
...where does Kyo live?
He didn't wear bifocals.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me – so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
He never even kids about it.
I'm sorry, I --
Only when I breathe.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't understand.
Have we ever met?
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
I'm afraid so.
Yeah.
He owned it.
Apple core?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
So I can have these? 
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No, nobody came. 
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Then where's the money?
OK...
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Oh!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
I know.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Charlie?!
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Yes.

Is it good?
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
It can wait.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
Hmm!
Thanks.
No.  They've passed on.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I didn't say.
At night?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Susan, I really think -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Susan!
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
You can't.
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
Yes, sir -
Can't say, sir.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Yes?
Charlie -
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I'm drunk.
I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Oh, yes, the bonus.
That's the train with all the lights.
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Rawlston is my boss.
Sure.
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
I'll have a highball.
You think I'm shitting you...
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You can hold me down.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
You lie.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
You have a better suggestion?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
What about Sing?
Sang.
I left like an hour ago.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Um... okay.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was it you?
What time was this?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Excuse me?
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Annoying Customer.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
I wanted to use your car.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
The Emperor.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
So?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
The milkmaids?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
You know what pisses me off the most?
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
How? When?
Why not?
Stop it.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
What?
And this is what you rented?
Living proof.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
You're a snake.
Shut the fuck up!
Make them change.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
I'll call you. Let you know.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
Yes.
Thirty-fire.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
I should start.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
It's not my store.
So.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Ooh! Can we?!
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
What do you mean?
That's because I never had sex with him!
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty-seven.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
...it isn't there. Yes.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
He's your cousin?
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
I'm not sad.
You're not?
Like hell you are!
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
More bang for the buck.
Who's shooting?
Fuck you.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Not on that leg.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
You couldn't.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Flare up of old emotions...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Hal knows what he's doing.
Excuse me?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Making things real rough for Hal.
It was great.
You attacked me.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
Half a day.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
There, what's that place?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
My wife... Alex freezes.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Where is he now, sir?
Well - I'm back.
No, brother. What d'you want?
Yes sir.
No, sir.
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Lice?
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Yes!!!
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
And when do I get out of here then?
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Prison custody?
Yeah... Pete the English.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
What?
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
The ride is free.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
When was the last time you took one?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd had to dig it.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
I don't know...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Elvis?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Pick me up in five minutes.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Vincent...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
You mean like benefits?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Max.
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
You're cool.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Who was he?
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
What happened?
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Who?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that.
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
And you believe me...?
What happened to you?
Slow down!
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
What is?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
You saved my life.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Yes.
Nothing is easy.
What is it with you and the space program?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
So what's the question?
Is this your dad?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Where then?
They're big details, Jerry.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Not today.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Did you kill my father?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
You saw me standing alone ...
What about you?
<u>Liza</u>!
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
You do recognize it then?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Night after that?
Agent Lowry?
-- Understood.
Your call.  Have a good night.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Where do you think Jerry is?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Tell me.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
No primer.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
So who...?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
What kind of deal?
That's my girl.  Done.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
The systems integration site.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
Sounds like a Russian general.
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
But the work --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Ellie --
How long was I gone?
Make that two.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
Why?
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
Oh.  I brought you something.
Thank you.
What?
Please --
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Git movin', I said.
I'll make it a dollar.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
What are you doin' here?
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
Tramp! Beautiful!
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
We got it locked in the sock.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Take it easy, Drag.
Like I always do?
Thass right. Just play it...
Oh mah baby Luke.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
No. No chains either.
Only kidding!
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
When he was seventeen.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
You already made the delivery?
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
You come and visit.
Oh, I think you will.
You know where.
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
Because of your phone calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
How did you know they were stockings?
Work with me.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
But it's a different m.o.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
I'm giving you Clint outside.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
<u>What</u>?...
I know, baby.  I know.
Just get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Who prescribes the brandy?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
My promise.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
You're damn right I do.
Because I think I'm wrong.
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
We were together six years, sir!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
It is?
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
I did this already.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Please, Letty.
You look beautiful.
Really?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
I ruined your wedding night.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I can't.    I can't see him there.
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
Come on.
Mom, please.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
I guess so. I think that's right.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Don't be ridiculous.
I have a terrible confession.
Michael, I...
Home free.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Aren't you ever quiet?
Yeah?
You've got one hell of a great body.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
You can get out of the dinner.
I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
Especially this last year.
He's a patient here.
No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I think I've heard this speech before.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
You're there now?
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
It's Daniel.
No thank you.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I assume you want something?
Where are you staying?
I know they won't be home tonight.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
You're sure?
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
We had a deal.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
I'll tell you when it's time.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
What'd they take?
Boy, you must be pissed.
Oh yeah.
You can use my car.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
No.
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Uh huh.
No shit?
I don't know.
Thanks.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
It's not your fault.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
Okay.    Okay.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Yes.
Why do you want to teach me?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
You're too young to understand.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
You're probably right.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'll give them to you.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
You know about Lo?
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Yes.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Father!
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
But the sword could be in his compound.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
No onions?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
You don't say.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
I saw it, too.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
It's just the dope, don't worry
I dabble.  May I?
Mister Funboy.
A remembrance.  A closure.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Who got himself what?
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
That's right.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
You talking to me?
At this hour? I don't think so.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Who?
How was your date?
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
I don't.
No.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
It was perfect.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
What do you mean?
Those are my letters!
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
No.
You'd do that for me?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Why didn't you do something?
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Just taking your photo.
I want to go home.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I know.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
She bought it.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
What do you mean?
Racist piece of shit.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Shhh.
Interesting.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Cecile.
Who are you spying on?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Exactly the opposite.
No, tell me.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
I've never done this before.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
I've already told you, she's not home.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
It's really important.
I did?
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
At the old house with the voice.
Are they nice?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I'm never unfair.
Well, you know where it is.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
I live right here.
But wishes don't come true.
Certain wishes do.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
Yes, Amy?
But there's no one here, darling.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
But where do you come from?
Will you be friend for always?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
A princess?
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
Oh, please!
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
But she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
That's the clever way to do it.
Will you come soon?
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
It got hit.
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Mommy read it to ne.
Now, I don't know Amy --
We'll see that she gets there in good time
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
At Victoria's Secret.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
No, did you fuck him?
And then?
My vision got worse again.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Why not? There's been a murder.
Hide him.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Frida? You okay?
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
No.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
No?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
No, I got it. It's okay.
What happened?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They do? Oh no...
Oh my god, what happened?
What makes you think I was the last one?
You got a dog?
Packages of money.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
Tell her I'm eating.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
You're some catch Lloyd.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What makes her think that?
How will we interrogate them?
He's seriously disturbed...
Loose ends?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Don't know much, do you?
No...  No doctor...
Tell me about them...
Well...
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
Oh... Okay.
Don't worry about it.
And we're going away for a holiday.
For a month.
Great.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Soon.
Yes.
I was a senator, you know.
What about containment, Alan?
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Oh.  Fine.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
It's fine.
Choices?
That'd be great.
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
Oh, yeah... probably...
I see what you mean.
What?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Does it make the cars any better?
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
I can't say.
Certainly.
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
What?
You have a lot of secrets.
I guess.
I know.
I know.
Yeah... It could be fun.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Come on.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Datura.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
Come on. Let's go.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
Let me see your weapon.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
Don't come.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
Women swoon!
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
But I love you.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Uh-huh.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Okay.
I don't know.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
What is it?
Todd Anderson.
I'll take him over mine.
What?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Yea, art thou there?
Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
Then you better start swimming.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Who asked you to!
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You people...rich people...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Right... You have a boat.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Keep tasting...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
That way.
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
A little to the left...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
A passenger...
What the hell does that mean?
Plans don't change...
I'm looking...
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
You want 'em?
What?
Get the boots.
John,we're going huntin'.
Nick's going?
Yeah, Sal--
They did too!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Worse since she talked to who?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
How was huntin'?
Yeah?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Psst. Vince!
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
Oh, Jesus.
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
Okay.
No.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
I don't know.
Playing.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I know.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Yeah... I guess.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
Oh.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Great. Hey. That's great.
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
You didn't get a deer?
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Merle gave me this?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
That's who.
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Up.
What'cha got, Bennett?
I want this bastard brought down.
I want to see my wife and kid.
And I want Doucet.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
What the hell are you talking about?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
My insurance won't cover it.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Drop it.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
What else did he get?
Not yet.
No you don't.
And you should be with your family.
My granddad was a policeman.
What's your name?
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
This little thing says I can't.
We will --
Belle --
He lied to me again.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
That's just too bad --
Not me! 
Sure am.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Afraid ... of what?
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws it is.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Shall we?
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
You're right, Mary.
Yep.
If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
Mary -- how do you feel?
Tired?
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
I am going to lock him up.
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Coming, Ma.
You aren't angry with me?
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Hullooo!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
You can talk to me ...
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Okay.
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I still feel like shit.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
How are you doing?
Ooohh....
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
Yeah...
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
They won't talk to you.
Are they on the phone still?
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
What kind of things, Leon?
They're okay.
I got Sal.
Call me Sonny-boy.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
You're full of shit ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What now, Sonny?
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
No, not until after they killed him.
No, that's all.
I used to, but I stopped.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
We won't have to.
All right ... send them the guard.
Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
I never been up in a plane before.
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay.  Which one goes?
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
Yep.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
That's the rumor on the street.
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. <b> INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY </b>
Take us to Vegas.
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Must you use that awful word?
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
I can certainly think of one more!
<i>Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.</i>
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
Talk to me.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
So?
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
My name is Eddie.
What makes Sammy run?
I'm working.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
He's completely innocent.
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
D, not C.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Can you pay me now?
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Gotta go.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Before I get off work.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
I can run out and get it.
How long then?
You a blue-moon fool.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
To get my money.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
You really think so?
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
'Bout time, Pop.
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Come over around seven.
Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
I don't follow.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
I haven't seen you around here before.
No.
Me too!
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
So, have you given him "some" yet? 
Captain Rob came back?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I don't know who we are anymore.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
I know.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Oh, you're good.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
That's not your tape.
Special Needs class.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
You were born free and free you should remain.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Uh-oh. Harry?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
It's a surprise.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
You got the Extender?
Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
They said you were dead.  They said...
My Lord?
Let him stand free!
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Always.
Why do they come?
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
Pain.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
It is my home.
I predict we're lost.
Really?
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Dracula?
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Yeah, I did.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
But maybe not.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
What do you mean?
Edward Wood, Sir.
It's that easy?
You met Basil Rathbone!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Like <u>what</u>?!
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
We're escaping!
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
OUR picture?
I don't think he's a schmuck.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Um, I guess --
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh, hi.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Bela died.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
I don't know.
Yeah...?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
I thought this was a group effort.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Isn't that the same thing?
Yeah, so... ?
What?!
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Sure.
A woman wants to be pursued.
Yeah?!
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Really? They were..
We're falling behind.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Are the TV people with you?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
She had white shoes.
Who?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
No.
Who's in it?
Cream rinse?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Leave. Go.
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Come on...
No. It's your fault.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
What?
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Yeah?!
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Great.
It's me, Ed.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
How?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
pierdo.
pierdes.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Thank you.
Do it!
Dick.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Doing what?
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
You will.
Uh, Jim?
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Here?
Yep.
Sherry... I love you.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
I also like bananas.
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
What...?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Thanks!
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What's it to you?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
How'd she meet Patchett?
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Of course... But how?
What was that boyfriend's name?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Let's just kill them.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
What about him?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
I don't know.  I swear it!
Nothing.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
I never truck with no sissies!
Dogs got no reason to live.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
But you were business associates?
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
I... No.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
His blood's always up.
Something like that.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
What?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
I want to do it right.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
How about White?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
None.  Call it a hunch.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Do you have any proof?
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Please hold, Sergeant...
Yeah.  Me neither.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Someone else?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Who else have you told?
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Wait. What do I do?
I'll pay you.
What'd I tell you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Them.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
No.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
What are you saying?
With what?
Anytime.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
<u>What's</u> your point.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
About the accident.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No, sir.
Just for the criminals.
What?
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
It's okay.
I know, but listen--
What happened to your head?
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
Not that much.
DePinto?
What answer were you--
It's how he works.
Brill?
How can I be sure.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
What are you talking--
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Alright!
Did they take your clothes?
Table 122?
Calm down.
Why would they--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I have a family.
So do I!
Bobby--
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
I don't know.
You would?
Yes sir.
Help from whom?  Christ.
I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Puffed cheese?
What kind of fossils?
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Excuse me.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Good.
No.
Don't do this.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
I see.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
What's the matter with you?
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
What do you want?
Rabbit hunting.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
Who are his ghosts?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Moose.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Very true!
We shall miss you.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Off with his head!
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Thank you.
Yes.  Dropping off.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
He needn't disturb you.
Yes?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I follow the wires.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
Of course.  When?
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
Oh God.  Oh God.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
A toddler
We can do that when we're very, very old.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
Go away.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
The windows don't open.
Why didn't I think of that?
We're getting close.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
No. Why would I be?
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Look on the back. What do you see?
Not funny.
We're only going one way.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
In a week.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
We are...for the tools.
Our equipment has arrived.
Charged?
Charged. Receiver?
I've got something for you.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
What?
You don't know the half of it.
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Where the money is.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Feeling old?
No. You'll see when we get inside.
They drive so recklessly there.
I sincerely hope not.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Which is--
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Remind me why.
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Yes it does.
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
Don't use language with me --
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
What's your point?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
I'll say.  Holy moley.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Yup.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Oh, yeah?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
And you can't?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
You didn't care about my case?
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Gee, I wonder why.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
I think we should makes some changes.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
That's right.
You come to the right place.
You're married.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
It happens all the time.
George!
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Better safe than sorry.
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
I'm just saying --
No, I wanna say hi.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
You're moving away?  When?
Wow, that's soon --
Who's Baxter?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
You did?
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
The temperature is dropping too fast.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Or you ran into something ....
Probably an asteroid field ....
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Now you're making sense.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Never heard of that system.
You look great.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
Are you kidding?
Luke?  I don't get it.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
... we're the bait.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
I understand.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Closer?!
He'll survive.
That is why you fail.
That they are.
Only what you take with you.
My mind fills with so many images.
I see a city in the clouds.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
Please
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Go on now. Do as I say.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
Where's Plissken?
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Yeah, I got it.
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
I said pull over.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Yeah, kinda.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Well, I'll think it over.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
I cannot--
Move aside!
But your life and lands are far from here.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
It is.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Not that I know of.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Rats?
Depression?
Never.
Please go away.
I'm Father Karras.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Like what?
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
What else?
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
When can I have one?
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh I bet he is.
You think?
Cause I like it.
Well you know it's okay.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Hi Father.
That's good.
Stealing is a sin.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Uh Huh.
No now.
Uoy era ohw.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
O'Lord hear my prey.
Is it Captain Howdy?
We don't need you, Frankie.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
They're falling out.
No bones?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
What's wrong with the kid?
Accident?
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
When they coming in?
What's the point?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Huh?
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You look awful.
Really.  You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Why the interest?
No, I mean it.
So do I.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
What're you talking about?
It wasn't like that.
What was it like?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
Get out of here!
I told you I was gonna hit you.
Very realistic.
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Okay.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
All night?
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
What are you talking about?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
He was just having fun.
What disease?
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Five years ago.  November.
Spur of the moment.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, we're not.  Jack?
Just call me a cab.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
I'm sorry?
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
How should I take it?
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
When we know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We're a team.  We work together.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
What's wrong with it?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Baker's unabridged.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Wow. You ever see her again?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Got another song for us?
Huh?
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Yes, well, they are.
Uh, well ...
Thanks.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
And you don't?
Huh?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Better than that.
You were good.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Ed? How many people live here?
He called her.
You sending me home?
Oh.
Coffee?
We outgrew each other.
You don't pick your brother.
Eddie did.
Fine.  You?
Oh, fine.
Eddie.
Drive.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
It's important.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
Don't hang up ...
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Not if I kill you first ...
Janie?
You mean like ... condoms?
What happened?
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
You always say that -- then you leave.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Excuse me?
I don't know.  Maybe...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
That’s right. And auto supply...
But I think I like you better this way...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu “Art of War” tricks?
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Where’s my real dad?
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Big Ed’s.
Like what?
She wants to have an affair with me.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Screw the rules.  I’m talking about the choice.
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
I call all you white guys "Jack."
A lucky streak, huh?
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
You just said everyone needs something.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
How much time?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
You’re a nurse?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
How’d you do this year, Tony?
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
For us, Kate.
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
I don’t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
I was in the city.
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
No, she’s not.
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
I’m working on a new deal now...
Whatever you say...honey.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
What...?
What? You make me hot...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
But I’m gettin’ close, right?
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Are you okay, Jack?
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Jesus, Jack...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
I need you, tiger..
Of course I did.
Last night was great...
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben.  Are you okay?
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Give me a mirror...
Victor did.
Is it safe?
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Ben, are you there?
Oh, it is.
I can go hotter!
They're not costumes.
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
<u>Girl</u>...?!
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
Front page?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Are you kidding?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Skeptical...?
I know that. But what's the maximum?
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
The Other Side got to him.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
No question of her loyalty.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, Cora.
Now I know...
I have no idea.
I feel much better now...
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
That makes two of us.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Oh, geez.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, but this TruCoat -
End a April.
Oh, don't be silly.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Sure right now! You're darned tootin'!
Yah, real good.
Okay.
Where're you going?
Shep said 8:30.
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Well, they -
Mm.
Oh, yah?
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah.
Gotta go?
I'm sorry.
No, I didn't...
Yep.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Yah?
No.
Oh. Geez.
Gustafson's accountant.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
He's at Norstar.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Look at my face.
Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
No, I wasn't aware...
Does this sound strange to you?
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Can't you give me something?
I want brain parasites.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
You can't have the whole brain!
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
You haven't been going to yours.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Here.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
No, supply oxygen?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
And, now it's gone.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
Can I stay at your place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
But a good strange.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Any historical figure.
You?
I'm fine.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Work.  Going to work.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
What is it?
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
Is this really news to you?
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
You took me to the house.
You... you can't be serious about this.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck you.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Why are you doing this?!
I swear on my life, I won't...
What?
Maintenance.
Excuse me?
You told me you'd say that.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Well, sir, you said you might.
Robert Paulson?
No!
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Signs?
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
May we come in?
Yeah?
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
I'm not following you --
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
I wasn't worried about us.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Sure.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Nothing is... anymore.
Let us out!
No!
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
There's the Mekong.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
I've seen worse places.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
What... whattaya do?
How much we got left in that minigun?
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
What?
About 22 hours on site.
Nice work.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Fine.
Meeting ... people.
Got any more bread crust?
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
You were great. Thanks alot.
My agent.  I called my agent.
No, it's not... Come here...
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
I... I was just leaving.
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Well, since you're a member, we could...
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You really want to help me?
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Who are you talking to Jack?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Sure...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
No.
No, I...
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I love it.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
Are you talking to us?
Hi, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
I don't know.
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Where's Catherine?!
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Tomorrow, then.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Of course I'd like to.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
What?! I can't hear you!
What?
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
It is true.
Besides being very rude.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Pardon me?
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Look at me.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Victor.
Nothin'.
I just wanted to see you.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Which one?
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
How old is he?
She didn't say she had no man.
You sure?
Jus' from around the way.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Sonofabitch.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Fletch.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Thank God, the police.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Margaret.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax.
What, the heat here?
Affirmative.
You find the source?
Nothing. They're still there.
Right. Fine.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
Are you serious?
Of course.
Wait a second --
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
No problem.
It’s okay. The cops did it.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Come inside.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
In this drawer....
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You sure those doors will be open?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Nothing to it.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
I love the outfits.
I bet you do.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
You are a rich woman.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
I ordered lunch.
You were in the war?
No. He was. I got him out.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you let me in?
You saw a forgery.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Come here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
She moved out.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Practically.
Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Get out of here.
I want something I can print!
Print this Frank.
Forget it.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
John!
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Uh, let's go sit down.
So you...
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
You're not funny.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Why have you come to my planet?
There's that question...
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
I don't need it that bad.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Really?
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Shock.
Are you okay?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
You're a poet and didn't know it.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
What?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
What?
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
What?
Man, I'm clean.
Did they follow you?
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
It's your problem.
Si tu veux.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
Who financed it?
Yeh?  Who else?
Why not?
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Strike out, eh?
When ya go back on?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Hiya, Jesus.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Why is it called Hellgate?
What is that old building?
Yeah.
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So what?
I'll go find Hayes.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Baltimore?
Don't know what's behind it.
I love you more.
Luck, my ass.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
How's that?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
You really wanna know?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Huh?
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
What's wrong?
Better.
What?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Which means he probably knew her.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Nah, just working the job.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
Where are you going?
Going?  How do you mean?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Don't do that to me!
Will you come with me?
You go ahead...
Why?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
My whole world.
Everything's gonna be fine.
You're the boss.
Who's Horace?
What?  Who pulled it out?!
Why?
Happy Friday the 13th.
Sheriff, you better take this.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
I could swear I heard...
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Wait a minute. I just...
I hope so.
Nancy.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
But what I get scared again?
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
You gotta be kidding!
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
That's what I'd like to know.
Tell me.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
She did!
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
He bought you that?
What are you going to do?
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Hear what?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Rennie's not coming.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Where is she?
Walking corpses are not real!
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Really?
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
I'd love to.
Where you're going, mister?
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
It's over, finished and done with.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Do not inhale.
Don't wait Efor me.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
This could be it.
This is how we've managed to last.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I'm not sure.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
I don't know if I can say that.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
Oh yeah?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
It's the kid's lucky day.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
It's a simple subject.
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
Matthew.
Because faith is rewarded.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
How come?
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
A little.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
A little drastic maybe?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Are you sure?
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
Did they take your clothes?
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
There is nothing I can give.
I dined at the prison.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
It would be five thousand more.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
It's about the Director.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
A day or so.
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
What are you talking about?
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
I was never very good at it, remember?
Antonio, the choir...
I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
How do I square the accident?
It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
Not that.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
We were just looking.
You celebrate, Jerome?
You'll be next.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You okay?
Small town, small bank, big money.
What do you want for dinner?
Boring.
You were asleep.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
That doesn't hurt.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Why?
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Twenty eight hundred.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Who was it?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
No, I'm not.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Two.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Then you do it.
Suit yourself.
That right?
Can he trust you?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I'll tell you when.
Nothing. What could I do?
Oh ay?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Yes.
Though nicer than most?
I work for him.
No.
Of course. Where else?
I don't know.
Nice of you to come.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Good lad.
Yeah.
It's not like that, luv.
It'll cost you.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
I'll call the police.
No.
What about Keith?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
How could I stay away?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Nasty way to go.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
Shut up.
...Polacks...
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
It's too...
Some contest board...
That's right?
Eh?
No.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
What?
Someone should stand up and strike back.
What do you mean?
Yes...?
How?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
As a robbery.
Well.  Well...
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
What will he pay?
What?  What?  The leads.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Why would I do it?
Yes.  I'm sure.
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
You went for it.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Down the street.
What?
No.
No, who?
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
Did they get my contracts?
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...
...after the thirtieth...
Let me...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
...they kicked out.
They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
What if you don't close...?
And fifty bucks a lead.
Now.  Yes...When?
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Did you tell 'em my sale?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
I've got the check...
You did?
Because I don't like you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
You sold eight Mountain View?
They...
My wife told me to look into...
Oh!  For the magazine...
No, his wife is.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Who did she call?
Why did she do that, Jim?
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I'm not.
What would have elapsed?
Tuesday.
It's not me, it's my wife.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You did that?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
You closed him yesterday.
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
If you don't want it, give it back.
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
On your pillow.
I can't.
Some day you will.
I'm not hungry.
What position did you occupy?
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
I saw him with you.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Wait'll you see!
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What do you want me to do?
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
She's gone, Tom.
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it, where were you?
I asked about Fredo?
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Mike, at three and a half...
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I want it met.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Tom, what do I do now?
Do you gamble?
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Thanks...friend.
The witness is excused; take him out.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Right here.
There are still things I have to do.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
So?
Not good.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
It's important.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
What if I say shove it?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
What about Michael Corleone?
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
How much more a month?
What was that?
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
It still hurt.  A lot.
I didn't mean to...
Sure.  I loved it.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What're you talking about?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
You do that.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Nice place.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What's to sketch?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
Go ahead.
No.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
Do you miss it?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
You first.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Clayton is fine.
If that's okay?
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Do I have any other choice?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
I don't remember that one.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You are much too human.
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
There are straps in back.
It's too tight.
Oh Clayton.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
You think so?  That's very kind --
Don't go away.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
What kind of job... ?
Jesus ...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
You want to come along quiet?
Let them go --
You'll leave -- ?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
I don't golf...
Something like that -
Not my girl anymore
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Good.
Yeah.
Donny-nothin'!
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
There's no one left ...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
one minute -- !
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
You guys are through...
We'll take it...
We'll take it.
Hello, Memphis --
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
What do you got ... ?
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
You?
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Where'd you find this one?
Run it...
For real?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Hey -
What's wrong with her -- ?
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No way ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
I do ... I cut "em...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Wrong preposition...
Hear you roar ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
What's that?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
Yeah, I'm cool ...
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
She soars -
Not --
Why don't you leave him alone?
No more shines, Billy.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Anybody!  You understand?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
Liar!
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Shit.
Let her carry this shit inside.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Nah.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do up there?
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Gone.
What?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
How much money you got?
Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
Retainer...
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
I happen to know so.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Find out what?
So who won the bet?
I've been busy.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
You moved?
What don't I understand?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Never been.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
He was my roommate in college.
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
Whatever blows your hair back.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
That's right.
No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Define that.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
No I haven't...
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
I don't know. I just feel it.
I can't go out to California.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
What about your twelve brothers?
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Fan-belt's shot.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
That's where I get off.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
I'd a found you, Ma.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
What's this?
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Really...? So what?
You could've been a contender, huh?
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
Okay.
Where have I been?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I was leaving.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Yes.
This is me breating.
Do you like the people you work with?
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Okay.
Whatever.
Yup.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
And they want me to make up for it.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Tell them my house exploded.
It's a place where religious people--
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Mein Dealer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
How are you? How's business?
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
It is cocktail hour yet?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Thanks.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
It's still early. What's your next class?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I don't care.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Tom?
Well, now you know what it feels like.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
That's not true.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Who's there?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
When are you coming home?
I know. We miss you too.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
What do you mean?
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Oh, how sweet.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
What?
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
That's what some folks say.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
I know where he goes.
What does that mean?
I want to watch.
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I'm okay... I'm okay.
You ever miss it?
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
Cool?
It's cool!
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
It was him, man!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Go fix the phones.
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
That's bullshit.
We did it!
I'll give it a shot.
Yeah. RISC is good.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
Name your stakes.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
I didn't know what was on it.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
I'll make it up to you!
What?
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
212-555-4240.
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Pervert! What are you talking about?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
You're late.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
I don't know Brady.
Look.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
How many bodies did you find?
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
This is 132, over.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
How do you know?
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Sort of.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I don't know.
Want a beer?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
You all right?
Is Annie around?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Promise?
What is it, Laurie?
But you can't kill the bogyman.
No! Do as I say.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
Of course not.
There's nothing else I can do.
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
It's really terrible.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Well...
This time I really think I have something.
Mm-hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Really?!
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
Oh, God.
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Oh, don't say those words!
Not because of me, I hope.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Oh, all the time.
Aren't they great?
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
You're not lost.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Jesus...Jesus!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Like what?
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
I think we need to eat.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
That's really nice!
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Mh-hm.
What, by a st-stranger?
Okay, okay.
Now, Holly's not shy.
True.
No, no, we decided!
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Hmm!
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
It was a terrible evening.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
...namely a personality.
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
You have.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Oh, I'm fine.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I am.  You-you made my day.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Yeah.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Mmm, what?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Some museum director disappeared.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...<u>please</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Yes?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
What's new onna street?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...would you excuse me...?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...are they hard to get?
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Show me the Pigs.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
The children...?
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Let the girl go.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
You nervous...?
Waal...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
How so?
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
You were given backup....
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<u>Yes</u>.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
You're <u>free</u>...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! 
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Then we cannot go.
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
....because we don't have any mmm...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I want the money.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
I know it well.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
Then what brings you back?
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
When?
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
You guys have been so colossal...
Your Secret admirer?
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
How do you mean?                                            ]
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Shut the fuck--!
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Shoot.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
Don't think.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
King David.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Heather.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Yeah, I just got back.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give me the clipboard.
I don't know. Should you?
S'okay....
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
Good plan.
Yeah, great.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
That's good. Have you done this before?
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
Remember he's left-handed.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
You didn't say Simon Says.
Cool off, we're seniors.
I think so, man.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
Come on through.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
sighs.
steps back.
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
Open this door!
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Saint Mario!
You're such an incredible woman.
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
Just a couple more . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
All right, then.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
It's inside a moving car.
Bull...
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
What?
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Really, why's that?
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Who the hell are you talking to?
Ambulance.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
What do you mean?
YOU!
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
LaPlante!
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
How recently?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Mister LaPlante...
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
John, I know all about it.
Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
You're sitting on your ticket.
That too.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
What about a reward for coming forward?
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
You didn't... get it on with him?
I didn't ask him.
How are they with kids?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Well, can I make an appointment?
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
I'm thirsty.
Stop knowing me so well.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
What?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I know someone else who's sensitive.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I'm having the floor fixed,
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
And I can't help having a cold.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Caution shows wisdom.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Can you really tell from doing that?
I would like to say goodbye.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
What do you want?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Jennifer.
Who was that man last night?
I don't know.
Why?
Is it?
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
I don't know.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
What will you do?
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
Yes, sir.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
I understand.
Bullshit!
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
It's about Mars --
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Okay.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
I don't know.
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
I don't eat junk food.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Where is it?
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
Just one question.  Please.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
He didn't say.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
It's right in front of us.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
They've been in there all day.
In my room.
I think so.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Yes.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
A delegation.
I'll be back.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
There is nothing to it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
How much?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
I don't understand.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
The United Nations are still here.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
How so.
I am on a list! What list?
Business is good at the hotel?
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
How much?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
We must do something.
Jean Baptiste!
How can we help him.
We have been abandoned.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
What does it matter.
No! Sit down now.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
You have taken business class?
He has taken the presidential suite.
The lieutenant wants the register.
When?
Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
On the street.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
As a tumor.
And I think that's case --
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Take the gun.
Prove it.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
He's dead...?
We're safe?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
I was in the middle of --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
What's going on?
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
And you think it's in there?
He must've unsealed the room!
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Sara...?
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
No!
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Ok...
She's hiding.
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Should I...
Know what?
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Did you know her very well?
So what should we do, father?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
And you...are?
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
Oh.
And what would you do?
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Your apartment.
Right.
I'll do it!
And he still sits there?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Not quite.
I laughed, I cried.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
You're supposed to be dead!
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
How long were you in?
Wha--
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
Baseball, why?
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Million five, lover...
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
Too bad.
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
I know that, Amy.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Your i --
Norville!
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Tell me about it.
What the heck they doin'?
This I know, Benny.
This you're familia' with.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
But, sir!
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Ya don't say.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Thank you for waking me.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
I've never given it much thought.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not.
I'm fine dad.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Hnnn.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
You know, dah--
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
It'll warm you up.
I used to know how to cook.
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
No need to make excuses --
But not too ashamed.
Ouch.
That I will indeed.
Shit. You're not planning --
Great, thanks for the tip.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
I dunno. I --
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
You get in trouble?
Can I come?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy.
Yeah.
No.
What's the D.A. got them on?
We already did.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Who's playing?
Then change it.
So?
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Yes.
Told you I could write an ending.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Surely you know the one who made you...
Then God does not exist...
She is.
Yes... My God...
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
But you're the fairest by far.
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
No. Laudanum.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
I can't. Go away from me.
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
But how will I ever know, Louis?
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
But if she dies...
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
I can't do it.
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
You have fed. You were made for this...
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
But how do you know?
I don't know any hell -
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
You have it...
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
Yes...
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
No means yes.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
I also promised Tyrell.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Then, we fight --
No, you're not.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
You know me to well.
I'm fine.
Deep breaths --
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
I wasn't dreaming.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Crowded.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
My friend -- what can one say --
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
That should decide it or you --
It was, the plague
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Yes?
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
Thea?
We have no time for that.
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
You see? Thea believes it, too!
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
I'm hurrying.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
It isn't me!
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Zuzu's petals.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Splendid! Is he sick?
What's that book you've got there?
I know. I know.
I know that girl!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hiya, George!
Old college graduate now, huh?
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
And all's fair in love and war?
You're not paid to be a canary.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Did you get a doctor?
Hello, what am I bid?
Now, let's hear from you . . .
When?
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Hello?
Uh-huh.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Mary . . .
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Left them at the office.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
Well, I don't know....
What the hell.  For you....
But of course.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
It's not going to be easy.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Sean!  Catch it!
Want to talk about it?
You bet.  Hang on....
It's still there!
Aren't you off-duty?
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Not the drugstore!
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Sailing?
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Okay, okay.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Late.
Why?
For me?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
That's great.
Mike's out there.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Did he raise the Kids?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Shouldn't he be at home?
Sure they did....
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Nope.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
I can't stop thinking!
What the hell is it?
Great.  I got some wine.
I love it.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Might as well.
Sean, baby, please....
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
What is it, 97 days?
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
Are you coming...?
I'm okay.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
I know I can capture it.
What's that?
... Me, too.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
No,  I'm not going through there.
... He ought to put him in here.
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
... Okay.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I'm sorry.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Not at all.
Someone's looking for you.
... Massachussettans aren't.
I'm a water-skier.
Sure am.
And alone.
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Now what's this do?
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Aww, can't I keep it?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Reach for the limit I always say.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
All right, hit those lights too.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Something wrong?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
That bugger moves fast.
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
No....
Where is she?
I don't know....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
What difference does it make?  It's here....
We're going down.  All of us....
You check it....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
It's wonderful....
No, you're not....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
No!
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I have coffee in the thermos.
You're the man who drives the plane.
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
It needs more time to charge.
Still tagging conch?
Will you leave me alone...?
I stuck them on, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Hey!
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Forget it....
When we got the grant....
We got it together, Jake....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
Who?
I am...You must know something about him....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
How come only me?
No way....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Then give me that Zippo.
Why?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
Car accident.
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
That's bullshit,
No.
Maybe he's lying to you?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
I don't know.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
I'm going back to the institute.
Then why didn't he kill me?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Two or three years ago.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Whass going on here?
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
A derelict.
Ask him.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
I just got goosebumps.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Good idea.  Thank you.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Let's not tell our sad stories.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
What --
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thank you.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
That's your word?
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
I'm a little worried --
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Fine.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Gorgeous.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I'm fine.  What's up?
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
You wanted smaller.
Let's go the zoo.
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
What?
Eric...
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
You couldn't have made that jump.
You mean it?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
To a degree we never imagined.
Goodbye, Alan.
On the island.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Mine's new.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
I want to be an astronaut.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
This plane can not land!
It doesn't matter what I think.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
So what?
John . . .
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
Isn't it obvious?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Why did you come here?
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
What?
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
No.
JUMP!
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
The what?
The Cretaceous.
What kind of park is it?
I know.
Not just every six weeks.
Yeah, I know.
- - and swallows fresh ones.
The fences are electrified, right?
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
They're not here.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Alan, listen to this.
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
What are we looking for?
Are they heavy?
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
Tim, are you okay?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Yes it is.
That's a good idea.
I doubt it.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
Kids get scared.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Who?
Dorkatops!
All night.
Please!
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
What about that other guy?
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
_It's a second REM pattern_.
That doesn't make sense.
And if he's not?
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
And you're late!
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
When I have no reason to doubt.
... All right.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
I could always apply there.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
That's your monkey, Denham.
What?
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Compassion.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
What about him? Yes.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
Do you always have to repeat?
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Here please.
Yes.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Mm.
Could I ask some questions?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Most of them.
-- OK --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Try some other ways. 
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Yeah, you got to me.
Mm.
Arlyn Page.
How?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
My bed.
Mm.
You and I -- a relationship.
I was wondering what that was.
OK.
No. I'm sore.
Then, close the case.
It's got to make sense some way.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
All right.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
We grew up together. Kids.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
The prospect of losing my child.
What about your mommy?
Lunch in a restaurant.
In real life when does he hit you?
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
We use the green and yellow.
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
I'm sorry.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
No.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Oh...
See you in the morning light...
Was there Burger King?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
A heavy drinker?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Yes.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I'm not taking him with me.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Beautiful.
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
Six.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
It's going to cost.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Yeah.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Slow down...Slow down...
California?
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
A moment.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Thank you. Please sit.
I have a copy for you.
With much bloodshed.
He is a capable man.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Two.
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
Is that big?
It is an island. American territory.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Can India help us?
Where is that?
But you will always be here?
I am braver.
You cannot.
I will miss you.
You, kill me?
How could I ever leave?
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
Much too young.
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
Thank you.
Why are we landing?
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
Yup.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
He never said "go".
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
As if.  Will you miss me?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
I'd be able to see something.
Good.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Alright, Jack!
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He looks like a giant tea bag.
Yeah.
You think?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Yes.
Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
This is a little different.
And this is how he came to the boat?
What kind of backup do we have?
You threw it at me!!
I just let go of it.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Look.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Else.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Kelly--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
It has nothing to do with--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
No.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Who's the subject?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Murdered...? How?
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
No. You ate yours.
You're a tough one, aren't you?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
A cattle ranch?
How would he test?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Early. Still dark.
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
You know I can't make that promise.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Do not.  Promise me.
Yes. I want you to go.
I have nothing to go back for.
Some say that's the way of it.
No.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Yes sir!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
He did.
And?
What?...
Crunch...Implosion.
That's an order!
Shit...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
The escape bubbles?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Maybe they already have.
I can't see them!
He's not at his station.
And it killed Bo?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
How's TransOcean doing?
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Take it off and let me have a look.
He's tanking on us...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
Sixpack...
DeJesus...It's got him.
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Oh man, that's just great...
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Seven hundred for the pair.
They were . . .
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
What do you mean?
He means they're thieving dogs.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
What do you mean, me?
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
It's pay day, ain't it?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
I think you're Nick the Greek.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
So?
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
How many wings have they got between them?
Twelve.
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
Just shut up.
That isn't true.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
No, sir--
Yes, sir--
Who's "they"?
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Do whatever they tell you--
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Charley Wade.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
You got a cause of death?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
You still going to all the home games?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Come on in.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
The Trail of Tears.
They fought against the Indians?
Same as they done in Mexico.
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
I have a B average.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
Cliff--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
We should just do it.
You could take it--
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
You know who it was they dug up?
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
What's in the back?
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Aqui! [Here!]
Is very beautiful, your car.
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
That's a matter of interpretation--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Open late.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
How come you never got married again?
I never said that.
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
You got in late last night.
Three months.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Got him here?
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Another woman?
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
Payne.
Been away. Up to Houston.
You believe that?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
You bet.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
Deep shit?
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
It was me.
I think we make our own futures.
Does that mean...?
Harry.
Do you?
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
He taught all this to Swann?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Hang on!
Harry...
I... have... to.
I left three messages already.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
--vanished.
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Philip Swann?
Are you a believer, then?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
A Mister Quaid?
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
I won't say anything.
What?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Yeah.  You could say that.
Yes...
How the fuck do you do that?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Is that all?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I don't know.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
What about Philip Swann?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
No!
Yeah, they told me.
Yeah, I'll stay.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Ok.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
I see them every morning.
I don't know.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
No, yes, it does...
But, I'm mean.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Yes, no.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Take them.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
When are you coming home?
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
One moment, please.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Sure.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
It's probably trivial.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I can't believe Will killed him.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I found the pentacle.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
We're still going to be together.
Eight.  That okay?
Seemed...on edge.
My secretary?
No, I wasn't, actually.
You heard voices, you know you did.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You killed my parents.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Sure.
What did he say to you in French?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Thanks for having me, Sally.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
What do you mean by that?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
She told me she killed them.
Nothing.
Child, take a bite.
He's still at the bank.
Maybe she is.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
The blue.
He's fine.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
Oh, sorry.
Uh-huh.
Shh.  It's okay.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
No.
Mom tell you to do this?
Oh, great.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
I was just playing ball.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Just one word of advice for next season.
How's that been?
I wouldn't know.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
Oh.
Kay.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Your hot-ass temper.
Would you watch the damn road?
You having fun?
That what you think?
What'd it say?
I said fine.
Right here.
She understands.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Nah.  I have curfew.
What the hell's going on?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Stay!
You're what?
Few days ago.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Getting there.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Why do you keep asking me that?
What?
For what?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I have.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You work too hard, Pop.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
Well what's the situation?
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
My mother had breast cancer.
He's not my boyfriend.
Don't sit down.
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
I'm coming!
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
yeah, good, ok.
Well...is that illegal?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
That was so great what you just said.
Diet Coke.
It doesn't matter.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
I don't know.
I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
That's confidential information, little man.
No.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
I was listening --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Picky, picky.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Yes.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
You do?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
...cocksucker....
You got it.
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
No.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
Alright.  Thank you.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Let's talk about --
So boring, so useless --
Yes.
In aid of what?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Why does that sound silly?
Not a problem.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
yeah.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I don't have to answer your questions.
And what about screaming?
What's this, how did this happen?
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
All your other fluzzies?
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
I'm sorry.
You want her right now?
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
As fast as I can.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Yeah.
Who?
No.
Do you have any children with anyone?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Maybe...I don't...
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
What's MOW?
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
I can't.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
You need to sober up.
Linda --
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Thank you.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
I didn't know the answer --
hang in there, ok. I love you.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
D'Artagnan.
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Shut up, knave!
I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days??!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
And you never knew why?
A personal nature?
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
No, Keeper.
What number, on the first page?
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Sire, I --
Sire, I --
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
What do you think?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah...
Gotta come from somewhere...
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
And he took a swing at you?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Seattle.
No.  A witness.
Found what?
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I knew I could count on you.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Both at the same bank...
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Could he handle a direct contact?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
No.
What do you want to do?
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Stay in the trees.
Let's get to the physical.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I have work to do at the plant.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
I don't want to know.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Yes.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Do you see?
You will tell the truth?
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
Yeah. It's right here.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Where did you get it?!
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
'Intimate? !"
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
We have it good, don't we?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
I remember.
Will?  You could come up here.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
You going back down to Florida after?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
...after a while.
And?
You're very tan, Will.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
That's interesting.
May I keep the file?
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Ten.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Yes, your Holiness?
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
He said he's coming back!
What's your name?
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
What are you doing?
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
Cypher?
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.  Now.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
But what if...?
You've never used them before.
For what?
What -- what lesson?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Of the Resistance.
That I would find the One.
Morpheus, I don't know --
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
I need the main wet-wall.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Gee-zus.
No.
I don't know.  It just went dead.
There has to be something that we can do.
What?
How?
How much time?
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
He's alive.
I'll be all right.
Nothing's private...
Why?
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'Thou art then a king?'
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Kennedy.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
No, she isn't.
No.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
OK.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
How much was the original loan again?
Fine.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
All right.
Nothing.
Charlie...?
Don't ask.
But...
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
You could say that.
Friends of yours Michael.
Can you spare it?
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Very.
And you could care less --
Who?
Of course.
Who's Annie?
Oh, the goddam party --
'Goddam party'!
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Hello, Quince.
He'll wait --
Yes.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
The dagger --?
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Glad I could be of some help.
Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
Don't you want to hear the details?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Make it go 'way.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
She knows how she feel.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
No.  Nothing.
The Board is waiting.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
Are you?
And you're a nice man, Quince.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Excuse me?
I am, too.
Why, yes.  Thank you.
No.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I don't know.
I'm her father!
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
Not at all.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Then what is it?
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
It just occurred to me --
I don't!
'The one' to do what?
Watch it!
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
How's that, Quince?
Yeah.  Or the week after.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Bravo.
Aw, you're tough.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Yer damn right.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
I'm having a helluva time.
Oh, yes --
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
So you're a one-girl guy?
I could be her.
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
I've got patients coming in --
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
Why not?
No --
But we've got time.
Burt.
I have no memory.
Amnesia?
So you're holding my calls?
Then why is this my handwriting?
Why?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard.
Interested in buying one?
Quiet!
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Your wife?
She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
Who did he go to meet?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
I'm not.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
About your whore of a wife?
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Thank you.
Sweet.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
Who's your boyfriend?
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
I don't know.
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
She couldn't.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Why?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Somehow, I'll know!
He any good?
Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I dance...
That's right.
Exactly.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Good samba dancing...?
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Do I need it?
Is this the protective male talk?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Hello, Miss Ukraine...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Nothing.
Where?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
We're makin' moves on each other.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
He did volunteer one time...
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
What would you do...?
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
Do we need this...?
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
You sure you heard what I said?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Don't say nothing about you either.
What of?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
They gotta be.
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
Sounds like they knew you.
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Ready for hard work, son?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Gonna be like money from home.
Get down -- where?
Getchmis...?
...He had a bald skull and...
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
KNOCK IT OFF!
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
I'll pay extra
Stupid.
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Beats working.
Be tough on 'em.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Section 13?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
Learn what?
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
Did you ask for bail?
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
The lawyer?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Take a look.
The Department of Public Health...
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Please.
You did!
So?
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
How?!
I know.  Help me get a sample.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Thank you.
The profanity bothers you?
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I'm...
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You want me to burn my book?
I don't know.
Great.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
I can't write this anymore.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
Maybe.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
What? What is it?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Not possible..
From her point of view or mine?
Sean, please..
On what.
Mmmm.
And my room?
'Thief in the Night?'
Well, that's good, isn't?
To do what?
A change of plans?
Lovely.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
What can we do' mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh.
- torque wrench.
Do what?
You didn't do that badly.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Of what?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Excuse me?
Yes, I gathered as much.
The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Why not?
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
I just need you to be safe.
Theyíre dead.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Yes.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
That depends.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Why should I?
What was your deal with Job?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
Bank?
In Langley.
My contact is extremely shy.
I didn't touch it.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
Why?
I'm willing to take the chance.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Why don't you take a look?
Jack...that's spying.
I think I might just take that look.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
What?
Thank you, Rose.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Again?
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
It's temporary.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I have no life.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I'm making you a steak.
Fast.
Yesterday.
No.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You think so?
You really are stupid, you know that.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I'm telling you your life!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I was dead, too.
Get all of me. Take everything.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
It makes you look like an angel.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I'll come to the wedding.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Why?
No.
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Alright.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
How near is she to death?
Yeah.
He's my younger brother.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
I have no secrets from my family.
Where's the ring?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
Where is she?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's incredible.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Okay, I'll tell her.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
But absolutely!
Then why are you eating alone?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why do men chase women?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
People home.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
No one live there.
Who are they?
We want ... a shrubbery!
You said it again!
What?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Well, what are you then?
OF course, my Liege ...
Ni, ni, ni!
No.  No.  No!
Follow!
What?
There.
... You silly sod.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Charge!
Shut up!
Come on, patsy.
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
Do me a favour.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
I don't know that!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Why?
And another!
I think I could pull through, sir.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Gosh - Is he all right?
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
What - the curtains?
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I'm ... your son ...
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Sir Galahad!!
Oh ... hello ...
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
It's too perilous.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
I didn't.
Not down south you don't.
Not bad, not bad.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
I'm getting dressed.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
Aye.
Kitchen and lower house.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
She's busy.
The future King!
It's so infernally cold in here.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
That can wait till the weekend.
You're injured.
I'm not married.
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
She's well, too.
I'm glad of it.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
Who by?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Aye.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am?
I'm breaking no promises!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Yes.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
What's her excuse this time?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
How ill is he?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
How'd you know it was us?
Turn if off!
It is.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
There...
Never been on a snowboard.
Thought so.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
But I'm not broke.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Wow!
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
But you won't.
Can you tell me what happened?
May I have your name please?
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"But you won't..."
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
Wally Brown.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
Go ahead.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Right then.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Pick with expediency !
Leave him, he's dead.
No !
I'm working on it.
I'm not listening.
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Let's go.
I work here, remember ?
Where ?
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
What ?
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Son, let's watch the tape.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
John, sir.
Good, sir.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
We can't.
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I would do it again in a minute.
What do you remember about her.
You want me to move?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Was it a nice funeral?
Hi honey.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
I'll try.
I've got something better.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
What can I do for you?
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
I won't.
WHAT??
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Boyfriend?
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Oh no?!?!?!
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Really?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Good. I mean...
He's an undertaker.
Yeah?

I'd consider it a personal favor.
What's it for?
They're great.
Committed.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
She'll be all right baby.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Well maybe for you.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
Oh no.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
He's so tiny.
I know, look at his little hands.
Good for you baby.
The boss is watching us...
No.
Deceased.
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Okay.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
No, no.
I'm very nervous.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
No, no no....
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Oh yes, yes.
Why do you think she says that?
Do you like her?
My Dad was funny?
Chocolate?
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
My ball, I lost my ball.
I would.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I will I promise.
What are you saving for?
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Hurry!
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It's a mosquito bite.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
Come on, it's fun.
Do you remember her?
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Duck!
What do you want it for anyway?
Hurry!!!
I do, she's real funny.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay.
... weeks.
The wandering sportswriter.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I wish.
That was Thursday.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
He said that, too.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I've missed a step.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Exactly what?
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
Waiter! Check, please!
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
A bad combination.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
That is so romantic.
The most important thing. Is being together.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
What do you have to buy?
What's wrong with her.
Oh, sure.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
President.
D.C.
When is it?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Your brother?
What is a turkey shoot.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
No.
The car broke down.
Bye.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
Well, can you tell me why?
About three years.
Do you ever do any writing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes. Who's this?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
What?
I have to go.
Oh.
Thirty?
Oh.
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
I'm not sure...
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
Yes.
Where's Bill?
Where are you going?
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Do you study at all?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
You do?
Southern California.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
You bet.
You think I should take lessons?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Yes, you are.
Which do you recommend?
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
What did you think then?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Yes, sir.
Do you have a back up.
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
What I'd like to do---
She doesn't talk?
Let's do it.
Describe Mallory.
That's indescribable.
Sure.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
So, what now?
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
No fuckin' way!
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
It sure is.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Three.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
They done that too long in my family.
Okay.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
In Birmingham.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
My father's the preacher.
That's right.
Maybe.
How d'you mean?
No.
No thanks.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
I didn't know you had one.
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
What's he like?
I thought you wasn't comin'.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What happened, Duff?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
My kids want me to teach them.
What about your boy?
How come you keep askin'?
We can always do that, Duff.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
Yeah!
Watch out!
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Well, that'll be the first time.
Take it easy, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
What did you say, boy?!
No thanks, Lee.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
It ain't in me.
It's for your own good.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Let's stay here, Will.
Like hell you ain't!
You hate Raoul?
Omar, listen to me--
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Of course...
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
No, but it traced me.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Nobody has.
How are we doing?
We got problems topside.
How's the ice?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Maybe something's onto him.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Go ahead...
So you're a wire junkie.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
What went down between you and Riviera?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
You stood for like a month.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Transitioned?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
They hid my car--
He's my teacher!
Dude, you rock!
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Better person than I.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Rob. Please focus.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
No, I'm alone.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Why?
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
We can handle it.
I know.
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Maybe he doesn't know...
Just out for a while.
Oh, come on Dad...
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Naw. Just killing time.
Are you nuts or something?
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Ah, nothing.
You mean a shithead.
Yeah.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
C'mon, cut it out.
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
Whoa!
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
'Morning, honey.
Okay, I guess.
No.  I'm okay.
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
Jennifer --
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
To old friends.
It's an amazing gift.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
You did it the other night.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Thank you.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm serious.
So do I.
Try me.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
I've heard crazier things this week.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
Now you're lying.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
I'm an actress.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
I forgot my bag.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
I brought these, but clearly...
Obviously.  Very difficult.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
What did you say?
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
A bath would be great.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Yup.
No.  What's that?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
What's your name?
Yup.
... get fired.
Right. 
I never fancied you much actually...
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
No -- it's my 22nd.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I'll see what I can do.
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
I did.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
Really?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Maybe.
Three.
Oh.  Right.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Mister Washington.
Will you come with me, please.
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Thank you, ma'am.
H-H-Hearts.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
What? Where?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
I'm not running a charity ward...
Hit me.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
No! I wanna go!
He is!
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
Because I quit breathing.
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
How much ya wanna bet?
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
You's better believe it, brother!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Hi.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
I don't have any.
Tha's your problem.
How 'bout twenty?
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Is he one of the loonies?
You ol' fucker!
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Buona notte.
What's she doing?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
No.
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
What great aunt?
Except possibly that.
Okaaaaayyyy.
What?...
My picture's up?
Who's this?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
I'm in love with you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
So it wasn't real.
Where's Positano?
Hi.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
You too.
Nice dress.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  Are you're leaving?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Very funny.
Just since yesterday.
Really?
Oh, hello.
No.  He smokes.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Is that bad?...
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
You don't have a passport.
He fell out.
What'd you find?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Men have ways.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
I'll be back before you leave.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Oh.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Where is she?
Good strategy.
Ten billion to one.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
It'll do.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
Thicker than water.
That's right... .
Mm—hmmm.
Maybe.
Don't say that!
Don't say that!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Why Edie, I—
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
What for?
Good. So do I.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I don't know.
I am?
What made you want to be a fighter?
What a fruitcake you are!
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
You are like—
I don't want to hear it in there.
But you've got to listen to me.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
What did you say?
I can? Okay.  Okay...
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Such as what?
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah, really!
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Can't we get out of here?
Don't let them hear you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
Her dance has pleased me.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
You may take her now.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes.
He didn't want me to.
He called the day he escaped.
Really.  Hm.
Till they got busted.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're gonna use a ram?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
Excuse me, Adele?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Yeah.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Is that right?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah...
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Love it.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
It would be worth the risk.
That's not what you were about to say.
She did, huh.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
You gonna write me a check?
You busted out?
There were others.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
You're not?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
It's a guy you know.
You're not my type.
You not with probation, one of those?
Here?  In this house?
The State Theater?
It's a --
I see that.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Well, I need that...
You mean hiding them?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Yes Sir.
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
What lizard?
A m-missionary?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Then why are you looking for her?
I didn't mean it.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I got a half a tank.  You?
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Bombers.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Brilliant, Admiral.
Have the planes made it to China?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
How do you like my hair?
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
I can't. It's all too much.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Don't say that...
And nothing will ever change that.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Thanks.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
I thought you were...for a while.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Can we split now?
Mom, is there any coffee left?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
How do you feel?
Oh. I forgot.
What about?
The house payments.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Way to go, Mom!
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Dancing with you.
What's that?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Okay. I promise.
I don't know.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Am I dead or not?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
What are you talking about?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
So are you. You've got a vision.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Pretty much so.
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Yes... why?
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I'm not burying him here...
You know everything, don't you?
Charles is right behind me.
Bailey, Brackman.
You'll never find it in the dark.
Sorry...
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
I said, don't worry about it.
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
That's not what I said.
Maybe you should think about it.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Honesty is always best.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
He's upset, he's sorry.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Makeup.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Correct. I don't.
Thank you.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Thank you.
Correct.
Beckett?
What have you prayed for?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
In some situations.
Yes.
That's right.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Where's Dad?
Yes.
Thank you. No more questions.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
In a word, yes.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Get a life.
How many do you know?
Since when?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Going on... like...?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
On behalf of the defendants?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
How many bottles?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Probably right.
60 years ago.
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
What the hell's it matter?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Company's not here, is it?
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Frightening thought.
What?
And what about the cells?
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Say that again.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
What if you're one of five?
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Just the same, I want one.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What are you doing there?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Where did you learn to do this?
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
The evidence was very meager --
You didn't think so then.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
That way.
Do as I say.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Zira doesn't want your female.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
He wouldn't leave her.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Read it yourself.
Then you admit --
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Of course.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Where are they now?
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
Where?
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
You really think so... us?
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Who gives a shit!
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.

I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Bank?
No, please.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
As I said before...
Would it make you anymore amusing?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
No thank you.
Sure... but somebody always does..
I don't.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
From you, I like it.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
If I did-I don't-now.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Right, Miss.
Is it a crime?
You understand perfectly.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
For five hundred, what do I get?
Get it in half an hour.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
So you're not a cop.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
Thanks.  I don't mind.
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
Would that make me a heel?
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
Mr. Mitchell.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
What do you want?
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
Send that?
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
I think so.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
Well.  What about it?
Are you always this witty?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Brandon handled the money envelope.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Ye have, have ye?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I have a rough idea.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Keep me company.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Yes, please.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
You just might.
I haven't really thought about it.
Well, you should.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
What did he want?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
To the Fleet.
You approve!
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Let me see.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for your mother.
They don't count.
Take a look at these.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Oh no!
They won't let you in without one.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
You gotta tell me where she is.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
Meaning you were expendable.
What?
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Where the hell is his body?
He's not really my uncle.
You've got a lot of nerve.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
You couldn't afford it.
Can I have some chips?
Uh-huh.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Occupational hazard?
Five full nights... days too?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
You're forgiven.
Why not?
Was someone rude to you?
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Vivian...
You won't.
Where are you taking me!?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
My what?
The young lady staying in your room?
No.
I know a lot of nice girls.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Doing what?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
What if they serve soup?
Steak spoon! 
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Yeah.  Thanks.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
I just might do that.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Brides often are, I'm told.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Well ... you were dead.
There will never be a need.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
It never happened.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
True!
Over the Albino, I think.
I'll be right back.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
I don't mind so much.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
He's already dead.
Sixty-five.
Thank you.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Get used to disappointment.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Oh, have it your way.
Australia.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Scared.  Can't talk.
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Well, sir, it seems ...
It's nothing ... nothing.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What do you mean?
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
I already have.  Come on.
Right.
Maybe you're happy.
You found a flop!
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Okay, take it off, take it off.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
No way out.  No way out.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
We swear it!
Good.  I will make the preparations.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
By the sacred memory...
The Blue Max...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Vat?
What have you done, LSD?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Tell me all about her.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
No one met her?
Or arrived with her.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Casharoonie!
Sam, if she's here...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Lila.
A good reason, I suppose.
No.
You want me to stay here?
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Yes.
Sam, I'm going.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Without calling me?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
You're not.
Watch your tenses.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Hospital clean.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
I'm thinking of it.
How can you even think a thing like that!
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
I'd like to.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
Uncommon, too.
Why don't you go away?
Norman.
Phoenix?
Very early. Dawn.
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
From what?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
But where do the rats come in?
You found Buckley?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
How? What can I do?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
A voice ...
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
It happens that I'm the law.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Nope, I'm through!
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Cry-baby?
That's what I said.
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
Darned if I don't! 
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Yes....
Where to?
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Is Rose here?
What is it, Rose?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
I said I wouldn't.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
The girl strikes like a cobra.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
But how would you find him?
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
He kissed her.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
Here comes Daddy.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
What do you think of her, honey?
What?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
All right, darlin'.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I am not being brutal to her!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
The hell we can't.
No, sir.
Strange voices, Rose?
Yes, sir.
Oh, no, sir.
Yes, sir.
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
She's fine, as if you cared.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Relax.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Name one.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Follow me.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
It's our job.
You know... you could say thank you.
Slow down.
Just got here.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Who is that... ?
There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
Keep 'em busy.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't do it, Ben.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
All set.
Hold me.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good, I hate long waits.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Quiet.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
If that is your destiny.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Yes.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
No, don't do that.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Oh no no no no.
No no no no.
No no no no.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I should leave.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Don't tease me.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
...Like you?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
It's not your house --
Give my main man a raise!!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
He got lucky.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Where're you off to now?
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
Six!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Bob.
You have my food in ya hand.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Gonna try.
No -- Just me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
...What?
Here's the card?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Yeah.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
See how fast he is -- damn!
See what?
...Yeah.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
...Sure.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What?
Sure I like her.
Whatta these guys want?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
Sounds like singin'.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
So you're Cloverleaf?
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Yeah?
Have patience!
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
A challenge, on my life.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
That dreamers often lie.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
I thought all for the best.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Is she a Capulet?
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Is that right?
Leaving...
And I don't believe you...
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
And who are you?
That's why you were riding with him.
Nothing.
That's him.
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
What's that?
I take it you still want the money...
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Of course.  Don't you?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Is that right?
Did he bring that with him?
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
Let's just say he knows who I am.
What's the difference?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Who am I?
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
A lot of people died.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
I know of him.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Very ugly.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Because I don't walk away.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
Why don't we step into my office...
Dwayne listen to me -
Sure thing, and --
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What's that?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
And how do you figure we do that?
He killed her...
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
And you're solid on that?
Why don't you get to the point.
Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
What's that?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
I might have to look into that...
Nothing.
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I don't know, Booth.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I don't know.  My friends...
You know I do.
What?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Uh...C?
C?
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well you can't have it.
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
Not in the trunk.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
So...what's the good news?
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
You think he skipped town?
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Two-hundred thousand!
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How'd you know?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
El Capitan?
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
I'm calling for back up!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Good at what?
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
You sound like that all the time.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
How do you know?
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
What did you say?
There's people up here!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
Fine with me.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Carter...
No problem.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Some Kung-Pao?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
I need your help.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but --
So was I.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
A little.
We are both full of shit.
Shortcut?
No.
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Stooly.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
No...what?
It's okay. For restaurants.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
You a cop or something?
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
You don't understand this guy.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
It happens to be how I feel.
Of course.
His hair... any color.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Where do you think she's going?
Poor Ike.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
I don't know.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
No, I'm not.
Looking for Maggie.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You'll answer my questions?
Without oxygen...
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Really.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Cindy the manicurist.
You afraid to try?
Highly suspect.
You don't know.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Can you fix it?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I don't and I don't think you should...
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
And the church.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Lighten up, what?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You don't love me, is that it?
What am I going to do with a microwave?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
-- who's married to --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Am I what they had in mind?
I'll wait.
Okay, okay.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
No.
About what?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Right.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
Okay.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
We'll move them --
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
And you're worried about him.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What's tira misu?
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
I don't know.  Do I?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
What?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
I'm starting to notice that.
I know.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
She's going to cook something for us?
No.
Yes.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Yes?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
Hi.
You did?
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I did forget. Luís told me.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
Backward.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
When?
Alone?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
No ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
No.
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
I was talking to my wife.
Not even a guess?
I can't.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Therapy session is over.
I need my paycheck.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Guess it's our turn.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
Don't get carried away.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Can you set that up?
Sure, Jimmy.
I can't tell you.
Good for you Jimmy.
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
Make me an offer.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Why do you say that?
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
What?
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
What do you mean?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
As a matter of fact, I am.
In West Fork?
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
You must be a hell a shot.
Hell, no!
Like hell, you did.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
My guess, too.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I don't expect to live that long.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
You never know.
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
You want me to take over?
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Trust me, you're the best.
Yeah, how so?
I'm listening, sir.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
But we accomplish the mission.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
And Sarge?
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Get lost.
What about you, Captain?
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Twenty-four-five.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
C'mon Lloyd.
Okay, I got it.
I admit nothing.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I won?
Goodnight.
Dad.
Crash paranoia.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
But I found the money.
What am I supposed to think?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
That's cool then.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Come on.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
What did you say?
This is so noble.
I don't think so.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
No, we don't have to say it.
How can I look at you and say this?
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What do you want?
I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
What?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I know.
You know Diane Court?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
It's up to you.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
I pay you too much.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
You're a good man.
Nice things cost money.
Yeah.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
Better this month than last?
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
More.
I didn't do enough.
You're sure about this two person thing?
I won't.
Cici. Who's this?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I live here.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
No way.
It's under control.
That’s quick.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Watch your back.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Where is your attacker?
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
You're not allowed to ask that.
..harmonica style is okay.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
What are you talking about?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Oh yeah, how?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Sid I can see you!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
You used to say that was our strength.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
And who is that?
Gale, your engine's still running.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
What the hell are you doing?
There a story in that building?
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
My movie.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
WHERE?
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
You know it.
And if you get it right -- you die.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
No, it's not.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
You know that's not true.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
Uh-huh.
You don't still think it was me?
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Who are you trying to reach?
Really? What?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
No-bored.
They'd never make it in time.
Guess.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Please..stop...
Afraid not.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
Should I be worried?
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Yes, sir.
What is it? Where's Casey?
I'll send you a copy.
I owe you shit.
And why would she do that?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
I heard screaming.
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You coming tonight?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
I'll be right back.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
You'll never get away with this.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Just like old times, ain't it?
I don't know...
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
I don't know, they just did.
I did. He's full of shit.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Tits -- see.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
Murderers like you?
We would have gotten you eventually.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Tonight.
What about sports?
I read.  Remember reading?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
And?
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
Who pays the rent on time.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
What happened?
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
I will.
Wait!
I don't know why... why now?
What?
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
I don't know...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
You got it with you?
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
He just couldn't wait...
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What's goin' on?
It's what I'm countin' on.
Comancheros...
Don't go blamin' yourself...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
You crazy?
Cherry-red Tears.
What?
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Does this dog here belong to you?
What?
Mercutio
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
The title won't do.
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Most interesting.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
So now you are free to love
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Put his feet in.
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
God be praised!  Locked?
As soon as I have found my muse
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
What? Who?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Do you think?
When the Queen commands it.
And I love poetry above all.
"Madam!"
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
You admire it?
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh, not for the world!
Mr. Henslowe?
You never spoke so well of him.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
I . . .
No, sir.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
A man, my lord?
That dog!
I was trying to educate you.
Why, thank you, David.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
No.
He couldn't get his car started.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
Not at all.
Yeah?
Don't know what?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Yes, thanks.
And you like it?
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
-- which is --
His car's still there.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
So?
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
And now you tell me.
Are you all right?
No, no, it's different.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No.
I refuse.
Don't you ever stop?
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Yeah.
What about?
It's about the burglary.
Of course.
did you hear anything before he cries?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Someone lost the key.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Yes. They're my friends.
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
It wasn't like that.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Exactly what I was --
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
I'm boring?
What happened to that guy?
That one, last week.
It's a breeze.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
The human condition.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know, I think...
No.
Don't you like her?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I don't know.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Whatever you say.
I know.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Let it ring.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Are you in love with her?
Are you?
Hello.
Gee, this is great.
I asked you first.
Why?
You think that's funny, don't you?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
No.
They are?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
You are today.
Can't you do it out here?
Great.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
The shrink? Many times.
And?
Yeah?
You're a genius.
-- what guy?
He's a director.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
-- we can't now.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
Sammy's?
Me?
Don't go, Jackie...
Yeah?...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
I don't know if you don't know --
Okay... thanks...
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Okay!
What's gonna happen?
Fine. How are you?
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
You're great.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
Never mind. Where've you been?
Look at the way I live.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Stop it.
No.
But what?
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... this doing hair it's...
All night.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
No.
Yeah.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
A soap?
And?
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
I am?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Oh yeah?
We don't think marriage is important.
I'm exaggerating.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
He's a hairdresser.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- there's not much room --
Do you have something against traveling?
John...
-- we're going to be here all night.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
What was the Donner party?
They had to, in order to survive.
Come here for a minute, first.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.  Dad?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Yeah.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Okay, Mom.
Red Rum.
Where does he go?
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Fine.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Grady... oh.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
All right, sir.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
What time is it?
I know it.
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Yes.
And you didn't see anything at all?
How do you like it?
Yes...
Why?
Wendy!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh...
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Hi.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
Do I need one?
We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
Well... was it a prescription?
You want to know what I think?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
Will you do it?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Perhaps.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
And I'm tearful!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
Vince...
You did what?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Were you wicked?
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
You know that song?
Um, I don't really know this one...
I... I...
I... I brought you something.
Excuse me?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Experience!  Right?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Again?
It's true!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
What?
What's a concubine?
Check your driver's license.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
And whom would you call?
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
I am?
No.  No.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Out of the question.
A vote?
But -- why?
I'm a Christian.
Then-you run.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Like what?
I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Take care of it.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
That's what I figured, too.
We're losing it.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes?
Really...
That was exciting!
He's kind.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
But, Bishop...
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
You must have missed your mark.
I hit him square.
What are you spying on?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Pardon me?
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Chosen me?
Not for lack of trying.
I shall, gladly.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Believe?
Well... so much for common sense.
How could he?
Up.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Father said witches live there.
We should go.
No.  They are all missing.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
Must I hear this?
It was not butchery.
What troubles you?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
And, what did he say?
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
No.  She has gone out.
Yes.  Here...
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
Father saw you die.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
What you got that's good to eat?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
I thought I told you to keep out!
I aim to kill you with it.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
They let you out?
How come?
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I like the way you talk.
All right then.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Why?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Is that right?
Yes sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Okay.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I reckon.
Me, too.
Yes, I guess you are.
You better go get your things.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
I believe you. I really do.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What's that you say?
Okay.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
I confess.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
You're looking good, Auggie.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
She looks just like you.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
For keeps.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
So I can get my job back.
What difference does it make?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I figured he had a right to know.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
So what's the time?
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
In Manhattan?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
He's dead?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Drawing's a good thing.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Thanks. 
No way.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
I just did.
His only copy?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
I'm not going to do it.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Oh, yeh?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Well, it seems to me...
You're implying th...
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
And the last...?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
And why.  Is that?
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
I should show them an American?
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
That's all he said.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Bye.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Manhattans?  This time of night?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Polish?
Fight it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
Good night, Josephine.
I got pinched in the elevator.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
And where's he going to be?
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Oh.
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
What do you think you're doing?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I'm Sugar Cane.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
You betcha.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Yes.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Goodbye?
I'll throw up!
Sorry.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
It doesn't matter.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
It's three weeks in Florida -
Why?
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You are?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Want to switch berths with me?
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your face is familiar.
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
For your own amusement?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- riding to hounds -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
I beg your pardon?
Why?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
I am?
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
What is it?
Oh - a member of the herring family.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
It's the crews' night off.
What thing?
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Have you ever tried American girls?
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Good morning.
From a rich millionaire.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
I never join nothin'.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
You Yanks and your therapy. It’s great.  It’s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, it’s way better to look hot while you’re doing it.
Both.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
What is?
Shampoo, got it!
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, “Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.” Trust me, I’m careful.
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Spontaneously combust?
Yeah.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
I have to.  I’m the best man.
You knew?
I get all the glamour jobs.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Ahoy!
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
“...but it’s getting there. “
You don't live around here, do you?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
You could? How?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
What do that mean?
Can you swim?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
No buts, Rita!
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
Sunday...
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Yes mam...
Listen, Mama...
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Good night, Mama...
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
Whatcha wanta order?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Oh.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Oh.
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
A hunger strike? For what?
This is the place--
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... Bacon.
Okay.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
That's gonna take a long time!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
What's the difference?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Sweet.
What is 'fisting'?
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance. I know.
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
That's nice, Stan.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Thank you.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
10-4 good buddy.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Yeah?
What do you think's going to happen to us?
What?  What are you talking about?
Barnes?
And so far.
It would matter to us.
That is one of my priorities.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
What makes you so sure?
The engines!
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Nope.
La da da dalala...
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
I got a right. You're my father.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
What's it look like to you?
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Cool!
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
How Mr. Kastle?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Like this?
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Where can I find him?
I'm not here to - I can't...
Do I want you?
I could let them go for ten.
...lane six. Yes.
Zip.
We would have sooner or later.
Fuck plan C!
Suck my dick!
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Fletcher, I want you back here.
I can't see...
Wait a minute --
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
How long will that be?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
It's impossible.
What?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
Damn it, Edmunds?
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
In a minute, sir.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
What?
Radiation shield, you think?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Too big?
Yeah.  Drowning.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Beth.
So what?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear.
That wasn't in there before.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Did you?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
It's either this... or I kill you.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Get away from me!
For who?  The fish?
For whoever's in that thing.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
You're staring at me.
I'm not being defensive.
Am I?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Did I?
I thought she was with you.
But why would she -- ?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
The three of us.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Please.  It must have flown here --
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
You mean a picture?
I don't see anything.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Unless it's an act.
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Was it a military crash?
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Who's going to pay me then?
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I know that.
Not any more!
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
It could be worse...
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
Why?
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
Move out of the way!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
What an honor...
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Hey, check it.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
I don't want everyone to see.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
I'll go for that.
Alright, I love you.
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
That was just a mix up.
See you on the bounce !
Yes, ma'am !
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
Flip six, three hole.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Uh, no.
Hi, mom.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Yeah, that's right.
Move out.
Not a problem.
Yes, sir !
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
To join with him.
Yes.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
I want him here.  Sit down!
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You haven't heard of it.
"Anguish."
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Surest thing you know.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Yes...
<u>Yes</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
I can't get it to come out right.
Where you going?
Yeah, you?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
I saw...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
If I go to jail...?
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Hi.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
I will.
Fifteen hands.
They think it's your First Wife...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
What'll I do for fun?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
What I...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
<u>Bobby</u>...
Mr. Barrenger.
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Izzat so?
We know that you weren't.
I, actually yes.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I can't do it, Walt.
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Why?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Doug, this is Mr...
This young woman.
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
He didn't have to tell...
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
I hurt my finger.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
My oh my.
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
How was your flight?
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
Is that one hell of a kid?
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
Is he cool or angry?
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...it is?
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Bet you did.
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Well.  It's for you.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Not with my mouth open.
Good girl.
Nothing sweetheart.
Until he's old enough to read.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
But Rache...
Annabelle put down that camera.
Then have a donut --
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Yes...if you like big hair...
Mom...?
That's Rache's song!
And when did that pass?
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Because you don't really seem here.
You think I didn't get that?
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What did you do?
Get out!
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Not personally.
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Anxiety.
Don't flatter yourself.
You're not dying.
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Aw.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Oh please.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
You ride with Annabelle...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
He isn't.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Yes.
Really? How many?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
My baby.
Oh. How did it happen?
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
We're not ready!
What's an audience going to tell you?
What?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Oh. What happens now?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Tired of this shit...
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hi, Dad!
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Maybe. She's OK.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Who is this?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Yeah.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
Three.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
Is it loaded?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
But what did you get on your SATs?
He did?
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
Well Cooper...
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
Are you going to kill us?
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
She's as good as gone...
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
Richter-we got a problem!
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Get your men to do it!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
At his office in the Capitol.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Oh, yes, that's right.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
That's right, fella.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
What are you talking about, Major?
What?
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
That's right, sir.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That is correct, Major.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
I know that, sir.
Ask away, Major.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Right.
Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Check.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Call them every five miles.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Yeah?
What's your point, Lothar?
Master Kong.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Recall what mistake?
Why should they call us back?
That's the point.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
How long were you in there?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Yup.
A cloud?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
What?
Yeah.
That's the rock star thing.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Watch out for that tree.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
In the limo!!!
No, no.
No.
Good.
Yeah.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
What?
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, man.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Shit.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Glad it's okay.
Oh, So what about her?
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
Yeah!
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Hi.
A Porsche.
Yeah. So, what about you?
What about me? I don't have a car.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's a mistake to think that.
Taking care of business.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Because I'm alienated.
Who were you talking to?
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
What?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
What? What'd you do?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Name one.
Yes, I stand for -
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Us.
And?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm-mm.
No, no.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Is that a threat?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
What?
Like songs?
What?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
What are you saying?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Oh, my god!
Yeah.
If you hit me...
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
So where are you?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
No car.
Fuck.
You sure?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
Spit from your dad?
Let me explain something...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
He Ikea'd us.
Yeah, hold on.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Or, I could get my own horse...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I didn't mean to --
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Thanks.
Are you hungry?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
You did?
Into what? A lampshade?
I tell you this is half sold.
You sure have.
So long.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
Nobody can be that busy.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Come on in, Betty,
No.
Come on, Joe.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
What assistant?
Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I'll come early tomorrow.
You'll like it here.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Okay.
"Mad about the boy."
Keep it.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
Yes, I am, Norma.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Wipe your feet!
Good.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
But where?
But what will happen?
Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
Sorry, mistress.
Whatever you say.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Come on, let's ride.
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Turn it against her.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I could force you.
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Theories?
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
I'd love to.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
I have to talk to you.
Not yet.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Me??
There's a lot of choices here.
Me neither...
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
At one o'clock in the morning?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
The boss wants to see you.
Columbia.
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
We've already met.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
53!
Storms! Floods!
TOMORROW THE OIL!
Don't cry, Bubba.
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Where did it come from?
Hostages?
Uh. . .
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Lois, I . . .
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I'm listening.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
You do?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Does she know about it? She's in it!
A parka.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
I'll be alright.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
We will bring him to his knees!
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Clark. . . !
Like me?
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
Lacy. . . I . . .
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
Who?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
It always is with Clark.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
The one Superman wrecked up?
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Nobody else.
You're a great architect, Albert.
One of them should've been you.
What's she doing in California?
I know son, I know...
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
First the pets, Otis.
He's from another world.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Ready.
What are you going to do to him?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Gets you where you live, huh?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
How old are you?
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
She didn't.
I understand.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
It just seems...kind of weird.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
No.  It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
You believe that?
Berries.
What do you mean?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
Yes.  He does.
What other people?
What happened to summer?
It's interesting.
I feel like a princess.
From you?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Oh.
You seem very sure about that.
I'm absolutely positive.
Why?
People who will help our cause.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
How old is she?
Daddy?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
What is it?
Well, let's see what we get.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
You could see the speedometer?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
The ramp?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
But you didn't lose me.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I doubt that it matters any more.
You told him that?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
I don't believe it.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
I didn't say that, J.J.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
When?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
But not for anything I did today...
Talk to her yourself...
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
At the bar - Sidney...
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
What kind of an act is this?
This sort of thing!
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
But...
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Nothing...
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
My mission is to protect you.
Radical.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Chill out, dickwad.
Where you going?!
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Uh huh.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Can you get us in there, past security?
Relax now, Sarah --
Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
'Dim-shits'?
So what is it?
Five minutes.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Three months.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Who warned you?
What did Goering say?
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Tell me about von der Null.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Of course I know what that is.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Right. Claims assessor.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Alright!
Great.
Don't wear the beige one.

Aha!  Is she young?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
You volunteered?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Good fighters.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
A game?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
It was a gift... from my brother.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
It's okay, dad.
What's wrong?
You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
Then, what good are you?
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Stop talking...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Big family... small?
Happy Birthday, man.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They'll be wanting it back.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Will you?
I said I would...
Robbed?
There's nothing to forgive.
What kind of vacation?
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
The key?
Didn't I give you two?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
You're joking.
I did okay.
Greetings.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
All night?
Yeah.
Maybe someday.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
What?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Yes.
It's all I could afford.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
David.
Just had to be sure.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
There's been some trouble downtown.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Snuffed her.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Y'what?
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
This ain't your lot?
Did Jenny know?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
First in, first out, that's me.
One thing I need.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Well, those are the breaks.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Not her brand.
Been busy, have you.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
What was that, then?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Where you get your bank statements.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I don't believe it.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
What'd your father do?
Won't he be looking for you about now?
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Eh?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
He had urgent business in the north.
You sure?
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Could do, yeah.
Yeah.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
I doubt it.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Is he here?
Ah.
Be seein' you.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
Hello, Birdy.
We've certainly missed you.
That's what he keeps telling me.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
It's OK...
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Cash.
All right.
OK.
Please, Ed.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
You don't have to tell me anything.
...OK.
How did you get into the store?
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
What'd he say?
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
It better be good.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Let's go!
Oh Jesus...
What doors?
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You're kidding.
I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
Yes.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
He's right.  Follow me.
Keep the animal quiet.
It's reptilian.
So what?
A monster?
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Would you mind showing it to me?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
They're all heavily armed.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
It's scared of me.
I think... it means it's full.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Why wouldn't I?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
Sweep the harbor.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
That's correct.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Saturday?
I can't tonight.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
No.
Yeah...
I still want to look over a couple of things.
Put some butter on it--or ice?
You're part of this, aren't you?!
You're the one talking to the walls!
Oh, just so.
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
It looks so small.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Well, we're FBI agents.
When was that?
They took her --
No, they don't.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
I know the name. Why?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
Negotiating with whom?
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
I'm not sure. A virus --
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
How's that?
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
Is that what you'd like me to do?
According to this tag.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
I don't know why I think they went right.
Been where?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
For the purpose of what?
Yeah...?
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
Lucien Baines?
Shush.
I'd be there for him.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
What's wrong?
Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
I realize that...
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Okay, okay...
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
You're kidding me.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Absolutely.
Completely unaware.
It's his dog.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
Ja, ja, ja.
Why?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Holly.
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
How will I know you?
No.
Schmolka!
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Calloway.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
In Vienna...
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
All right, Calloway. You win.
Two thirty.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Heard of Harry Lime?
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Of course, of course, of course.
Never heard of him.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Yes.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Coffee.

Yes.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?

Nice work.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
I'm sorry.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Who the fuck are you?
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
I don't, but...
Just don't.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
I just read it....
Killing himself.
No.
What do you care?
Why?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
What assholes.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No. What are you looking for?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Nothing. Let's go....
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
Why?
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Listen to me....
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
That's meat.
They're not my people....
The mother.
It will.
Who even knew?
I have an idea....
I can tell....
What?
What do you mean?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You know each other?
I think I'll have a coffee.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
How many are, down there?
Six seconds.
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Fine!
No...
Great!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
You're staying at the hotel?
... For the mermaids.
Well... about everything.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You'll understand.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Johana... New York.
In my apartment?
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
They got the new T.V.
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Of course, that's what they're for.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
... Yes?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh. Okay.
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
A stereo type alarm system?
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Resting?
Mmm———yes.
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
I drink.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Some other time.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
Tell me.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
I thought they came right past here ——
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Why?
Clo-Clo?
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Yes.
Yes. Do you mind?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
You drive a hard bargain.
Who is Friedman?
I... If you don’t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There’s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Have you finished?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman’s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
No!
Leon didn’t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
Leon could still have hung himself.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
You bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Something like that.
Here we go again.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
A criminal?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
And who does Friedman work for?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
B-Black...
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
You seem very sure about that.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
I’ll be alone.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Can I get up now?
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
How’s the boy doing?
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
If you can, send me a receipt.
Huh! You’ve been around, eh?
So why didn’t he?
That’s what he said...
Mossad?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Well...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
No, but...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Do as I say!
Good.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Yes, but...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
If there was, I didn't see it...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
I know...
He's on the other side of the river.
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
But my voices... they promised me...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Oh no?  How about this one?
Do you think you are ready?
So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
My father's.
Then... why are you here so often?
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
I haven't seen him.
Tough luck.
Yes, please.
That makes a change.
They were taking you away.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
You made contact?
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch his hand
No sound at all?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
I'll be back.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
What are they?
Everyone has to practice.
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
It's my mother's piano.
You've missed this bit.
Do I know any gigs?
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
If that's the way you want it.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
Which one?
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
Then you'll do it?
If we ever get to it.
He threatened to kill me.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
Raise 500.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
You're more gutless than I thought.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Think nothin' of it.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Yeh, he knows that.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
No.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Come on, gimme a break.
No.
Just a minute...
Nothing.
Go!
Oh, here she is.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
You hand that over to the police.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
What do you mean?
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
There. 
You see how much we have to say.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
What would your mother say to that?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
What'd he think it was to you?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
I see.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
I couldn't go near that woman.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
What bonds?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
Yes?
What'll I do if something comes up?
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
No word at all?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
They'll want more than your word for that.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
By the way, how is your father's side?
Santa Claus.
Maybe a drink would help you.
I'd like to see you work.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Breakfast.
Yeah.
Macaulay.
Is that another Christmas present?
Did I give it to you?
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Oh take it!  Please take it!
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Sure.
Smart gal.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Who do you think did it?
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
How did you get in here?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
Maybe she has.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Home?
Nobody's going to hurt you.
You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
You just go when I say go.
We can't just go off and--
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
You don't know that.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It's a combat action.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
Oh, that's fun.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Mine.  Land mine!
Just relax.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Just stay down.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
Why haven't they killed us!?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Yeah.  So?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
You know what I'm doing with my half?
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Yeah, well, we're not.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
What happened?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Looks like food.
It's 3+27 hundred
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
I don't want to lose you.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
But you can't.  We must escape.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Right now.
That way.
Maternity ward, huhh!
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
Where's LUH?
Yes.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Thanks.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Thanks.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Mike Reilly.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Only once, at Redstone.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Would you?
Off the scale.
No excuses, just do it!
Oh shit...
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Reilly! He's loaded!
Taylor's dead.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
A ticking bomb...
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look who's talking, old man.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Yeah, just a nick ...
I thought I told you--
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron.
You can trust me.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
What do you mean?
You say I am a crook.
M'sieu Monescu!
Thank you, Major. 
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Please.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Two fifty-three, five--
Darling!
Ah!
They're all right, aren't they?
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Oh! You didn't read it!
What's wrong now?
Then lunch in the Bois--
Then a little nap--
Correct!  Good night.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Please! 
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
I don't believe it!
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Yes, Madame Colet?
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Because I hate him--because I love you!
But you saw it here.
That's right.
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
I'm tryin' boss.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Get that outta my face.
A hundred and one next month.
Don't you mean work me?
So do I.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Good. Settled then.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
Excuse me.
You're crazy.
It is that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
I see you.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
A mistake?
Jack, I --
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Charmed, I'm sure.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
We'll save you a place at our table.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
Very much--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
There's soft music--
Never eat before the show.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Don't rub it in.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
What?--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
My change.
Now you're talkin'!
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
You take some awful chances.
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't be surprised--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
O.K. Heads you win.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Cut it out.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
I thought I put you to bed.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
He's all right.
You leave the kid alone.
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Let me look at it.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
I don't understand.
Well I'm not so go home.
Come and get him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Good.  That's real good.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Well... 'bye.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Better.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
But Doc-
Sorry, sorry...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
All right, Doc...
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
What?
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
'Least you admit it.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Drop his horse.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
That a fact?
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
I'm on my way.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
And still not a thing to watch.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Nothing.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
Well... If you insist.
Fishing?
He tied one on.
That's reassuring.
Depends what number you write.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
Blood or Dutch?
Don't say it.
If not?
I am. What do you want?
No -
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
Get more men up there!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Junior spends time with his child.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You always got something to say.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
Like muddy waters?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Do you think you won?
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
Well, you just have to move further out.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
How is the garden doing?
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
What happened to your hand?
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
Tolerable well.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Hattie is a different person now.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Woody!  Buzz!
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Mm-hmmmmm.
No.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Go away.
Sorry.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Woody!  The rocket!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Are you peeking?
Murderer!
Did I get my package in the mail?
She's sick!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
You are a liar!
You murdering dog!
No, no, no, wait!
It's busted.
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Speed up!
I like plaits.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Home is where the heart is.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
It's all right, Finn.
I don't know what you mean.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
No.
How much?
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
You will believe me, because it's true.
What is he being charged with?
How much do I pay him?
What?
Goodbye Arnie.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
Helena --
Will we get invited to the White House?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
What is this, like freebase?
Nope.
I don't know.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
Depends on the state.
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
Yeah!
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
No.
Javier Rodriguez.
I'm aware of that.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
I have money --
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
I'm going home.
Great.
Sorry.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Holding hands?
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What happened?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
It's no problem.
No. Me Neither.
Aye.
Have you got any gear on you?
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Give me the gun.
What's wrong, Allison?
Did he -- you know?
God, you're sick.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
How much?
So?
But you don't have the money?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
Why, thank you.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Six weeks!
Where did she come up with that?
It could. Yes.
He doubts me.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Pavel.
But the shuttle-
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Join my quest.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Goodnight, Doctor.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Yes, Captain.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Fire the rockets!
Not possible. You were never alone.
Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
No. I refuse.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Do you?
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Are you embezzling?
I don't get it.
I know, I met him.
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
I want to go to his place.
That Dillinger's on to him.
For being on to Dillinger.
Yeah...?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
For sure...
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Cute.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
It can be arranged...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Jump.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
We have to get off this beam!
Where are you going?
I have a book report.
You seem fine now.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
What?
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Fourteen, Harry.
No way.  Not Dana.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
In her dreams.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
He could be working her to get to you.
What are you talking about?
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
So, it was your first time.
Yes, sir.
I adore it.
Oral hygiene?
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
They said you had to run out.
He needed my help.
Do you still love your husband?
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I think so.
Yup.										*
Did you pork her Harry?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
We're going to Paris?
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
I just glances inside.
What letter?
Don't eat anything.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
'Bout twelve.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Yes, I would.
Turn-offs?
She OD'd, didn't she?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Uh-huh.
This motherfucker sounds charming!
Will you be my wife?
I don't believe so.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Really?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
How come?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
That rhymes.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Elliot.
Elliot what?
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Yeah?
In case of what?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Really?
How 'bout me what?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
No. No you're not.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
That's about all I ever eat.
I really don't know.
She seems very nice.
What?
What makes you think I could do that?
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
That's bullshit.
- Because it's good!
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
No.
Uh, what?
You're still a little... disoriented.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
What kind of information?
Do you know why you're here, James.
You wouldn't understand.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Do you know what year it is?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
See -- you can drive after all!
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
You... you left them a message?
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
What's that mean?
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
He's been tested for drugs?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
But, in particular?
Where in Mexico would you like--
But he's dead.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much?
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
I think I burned my gun hand!
It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
Sheriff Potter.
Who the hell is this!?
You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
Do you have to call me that?
You sure you can manage?
Yes, I have.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
You live pretty good.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
What are you talking about?
I wanted to talk.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't yell at me!
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
Funny thing.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I'm here.
The trunk.  It's locked.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
No.  I swear it.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I had a problem getting my car back.
Isn't that illegal?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Christ, Jake, please--
But you was going to fight for me.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What the hell are you talking about?
What's your name anyway?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
A hundred-forty-five really.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Hell no!
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
That a fact?
...And everything is nothing too.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Oh, shit!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I'm her husband.
Darrell's a moron.
About what you said this morning.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
I need thirteen.
No!
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Darrell--
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Darrell.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Soda.  You know.
It's Grace.
I got it.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Did you like it; me watching you?
A medicine man?
The same thing you do.
Beautiful?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
There is no us, remember?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
One way, or round trip?
Heineken?
Genuine Draft?
No.
What did I say?
I'll keep it in my office room.
I know.
Okay.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Yes. Is this David?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Yes.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Skeptical about what?
Was it serious?
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
Are you for real?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
That's not what I witnessed David.
Yes he is.
How much can you lift?
No Jeremy.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Do you know why?
Okay.
Fine.
How so?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Why?
But what they done, they...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Oh.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Two weeks, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
HEY, KID.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
How far kin you see?
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Three.
What?
Who said that?
Yeah?
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
We done that stuff.
Hell, yeah.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
And ?
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Goddamnit.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
If you'll just let me -
Tough break.
I'11 be alright.
Well, I'm sorry.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Hungarian?
You know damn well, dead-man.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Who is he?
Did they charge him with anything?
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
What call?
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
How good's your intelligence?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
...I was one of a group of...
Well, many reasons, actually...
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Objection.
I . . ..
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
That's what I'd planned to...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Why?
I understand.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
That happens.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
I think I will.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Admittance form is wrong.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
The Doctors.
... I know.  I went ...
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
... I understand ...
She told me.
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
Yes.
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Almost a year.
And you like it.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Then?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Well?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
It's not my line.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
And when she goes to those places...
What for? Who are you?
You're not far wrong.
Who you are --
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Why?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?!
No, it's not right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Wherever you'd like...
That's what I had in mind.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
No!
I don't know... Switzerland?
Some money.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Where were you?
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Good-bye.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
I don't like them.
Where?
The tall trees...
When?
...somewhere in the light.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
What else?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
No... we're together...
To the church, I must go there.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I had to quit, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
That!?!
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Who?
Do you know him well?
You haven't told me everything.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Yeah.
What I've been doing?
Naturally.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Can we have it by tonight?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
What's that?
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
I'm not getting a ticket.
You want to hear me out?
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
You don't know what you're doing.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Sure, why not.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
I am not flexible on this.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
I know...
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Lois please.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Good God...Good God...
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
You always were a jealous man.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
You hate women.
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
How about my Fatburger?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Sent it.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Right before the wedding?
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
You will not be common!!!
Kiss me...?
Maybe.
I'm mad at you.
What okay?
The chairs.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Yeah. Sure.
I know.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Move the bodies?
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
I don't hear it.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I guess.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
The stone age.
So where to on the honeymoon?
Give them to Refugio.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
You must listen to me before you go.
Yes, sir.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
Fifteen yards.
Good.
He was asking for it.
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Why?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
How much do you want for him?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Don't say that.
Where?
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull!
You little liar! Get out of here!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
Yes!
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Have I slept long?
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
I don't know.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Got it.
What's the assignment?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I haven't been working on anything.
What's wrong with Parker?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
John died.
That's not true, Parker.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
Don't worry about it, all right?
This is my area of expertise.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Where did you plant the C-4?!
No, this is great.
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
What'd ya think?
Come on.
No, no, no...
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Who's gonna tell'em.
Why?
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...?

Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
...we own it?
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Why do people go to war?
Would you go to War to do that? 
...Yes.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Because.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
...we get our hands on him?
Mmm.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
...one more day.
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Why are they ...
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
They look stupid.
Thank God this is America.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
You like it?
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
Please, no thanks... 
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
The FAA announcement.
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
What was that?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
What? How do you know about my father?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I don't understand.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Gordon.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
Well, why stop at that?
I don't.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Allow me sir
Good evening sir.
She went to a waxwork party
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Who's is all this?
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
They're all human beings
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I know he does.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
A ghost?
No.  But once I heard...
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Have you been hurt?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
I am.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
She isn't here.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
Um...sure.
You know where she is?
Please leave me alone.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
I came in from my room...
Oh God...
Stop.
Do we have to?
I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Yep.
You got it.
What?
The planchette?
Please.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.
How is it?
You know what I mean.
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
Wanna fool around?
Tomorrow.
To make sure she's all right.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house.  I was scared.
Of course.
You're kidding.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
I didn't do that.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Sweetheart--
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
I felt you...looking through me...
You told me that I was...
What's wrong with me?
Not personally.
Your wife...
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Get out of my way.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Michael, Rowan should -
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
Eighty million doll --- ?
It wes a dream...!
ENOUGH!!!
Like this...?
I love Michael...
Only you...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
He fools around with his patients too.
Doctor's orders- - -?

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...?
Let's see.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Dropped it.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Sure...
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
then why did you marry her -
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
It's what you would do to me
No - I'll have you after
Is LESLIE here?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
I defy any and all limits.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
And some really fast cars.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
I love those springy head puppies!
God, I love being dead.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
The lesson being?
I will not have my boys arguing.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Of course we were.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
You never know around here.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I doubt it.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Amen to that.
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Yellow pages?
You better.
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Of course I like girls.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Me? The King of Coitus?
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
That's perfect.
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
Kelly Van Ryan...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
What about the blood?
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
He was large?
Then what?
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
You didn't cuff her?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I wanna go home now.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Curiosity, I guess.
About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
About what?
And she wanted to talk.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
I'm going to hit you.
Uh... how long ago was this?
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
My pleasure.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
You bring the best out in a man.
That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
And?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
Then come with us.
Yes...?
Madmartigan.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
I thought you had her!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
You?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Me!
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
I changed her already!
Madmartigan.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
What are you going to do?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
What have you got?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
I would not be too sure.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
A real fireball.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
That's your way, not mine.
Here. Whenever you want them.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Wrong.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
I don't think she knows.
You might have killed him!
I wish dawdie was with us.
No --
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
I don't believe you!
Goodbye, folks!
Oh!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Uh-huh.
Oh, you....
Stop her!
Oh...
Oh --!
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Yes.
Oh --
I think I'll miss you most of all.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Leave her alone!
It's too late!  There they....
Who at?
What was that?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Hold still - hold still --
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Yeah.
You mean she bit you?
Ohhhhhh!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Let's.
Oh - look out.
You know something?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Well, that's you all over.
Now, now, don't fret.
Go on!
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren’t around, they’d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
What the hell are you talking about?
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Just wanted to put him on edge...
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I know.
...you should rest.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You can drop the act, it’s over.
He used your exact words.
Soon she’ll be everywhere.
You turned Renard.
You, of course. I need some information.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Bond!
Could...could you come?
Please.
Yes.  Au revoir...
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
I won't do that.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
And what if you¹re wrong?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
You're sure?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Laurie --
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
I don't think she's coming with us.
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Go to hell.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
You don't have to do that.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Let's do this.
Let me.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Here we go again.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
We have to find Magneto.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
Were you now?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
To find Rogue.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
If she held on any longer she could have.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
I did, sir.
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Yes, sir.
What?
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMmmm.
You have your tickets?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
All right then!
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
You must be Igor.
Yes, just the two.
I wonder what's got into them?
What are you doing here?
What?
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Maybe...if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
That sound good, boss.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well, this explains the music.
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
MMmmm.
MMMMmmmmm!
Yes.
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
