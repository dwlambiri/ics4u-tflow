Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Where?
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Tons
The "real you".
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Expensive?
Hi, Joey.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Can we go now?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
But you hate Joey
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
You set me up.
I just wanted --
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
So they tell me...
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Get out!
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
He seems like he thrives on danger
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Are you lost?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Block E?
An attempted slit.
William didn't even go to high school
Neither has his heterosexuality.
No fear.
Who cares?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Funny, you're the only one
I'm fine. I'm
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I told you
I hate him.
You know what they say
No, you weren't
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
BIANCA
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Then you screwed up
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You know what I mean
No what?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
What?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Which parts?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Oh yeah.
Right.
What?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Sweet love, renew thy force!
With the teeth of your zipper?
See you next week!
You're not helping.
But -- who -- what --?
Did I have anything to say about it?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
There'll be a time.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
Then you are too ambitious.
... for a commoner?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
So was Christ!
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
Surely you can do anything you want.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
You're right.  Let the men decide.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Oh, sure.
I was all of these.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yes, but he was a cop.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What are you asking me?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Who do you think, Chief?!
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
Any I.D.?
It's okay.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
No, what is it?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Hmmmm.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My folks are.
Stay here.
You got any better ideas?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'm on duty.
Something back home?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Don't be late.
Not what.  Who.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
No.  Are you proposing?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Where's Czech girl?
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
Okay.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
Shut up.  Look!
No, I don't get that!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Ha. Ha.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
You've got a call.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Yeah?  What kind?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Clean?
You hear that question, Garcia?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
She's wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
Yes.
Yes, I thought so.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
No.
Yes.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Well, don't worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I see.
Well, I'm glad about that.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Vodka.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
I ain't tired yet.
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Would you guys...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Come on.
Half a million.
Jesus.
Not likely, convict.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
No way...
What about Ganz?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Don't worry about it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
You couldn't get to him?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
One of  em's in the slam.
Doesn't look like it.
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
You're hopeless.
What's wrong with that?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
That's the way I see it, too.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack?  What was that?
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Where is he?
How would you know?
Shut up.
Can't complain.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Billy, go ahead, break it...
First, the money.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Try and take it.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
No thank you.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
I brought the girl remember?
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
That's what I thought.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We have to save the world.
Of course.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
What is?
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
They are... with me...
How many points you got left on your license?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
...'Scuse me?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
You have nine points left on your license..
Found it?
It's like a cab isn't it?
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
To save the world.
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
Why not?
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Cornelius..
Oh god!
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Apipoussan?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I want to sleep... forever...
Exactly.
I love you...
Been here long?
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
I love you.
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Mrs. Christian.
What?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
I'm telling you...
Nobody knows anything.
I promised him to Machine.
Is it?
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
They should be here any minute.
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Leave him alone.
Alright, Tom.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
I never killed anyone.
You are a private investigator?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Yeah... guess so.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Twenty-five.
I don't know, where are yours?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I try to be.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
I don't know.
It got to be too much for him.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
No, sir, he is not.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay.  Fine.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Kristen...
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Enough of that crap.
Earth to Alice...
Let me talk to you.
She knew she was gonna die.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
How did you know that?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
To take a picture.
Very funny.
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
Now.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
Mark!
That's their problem.
No shit.
My undying love.  Have some.
Makes you look like a nun--
I want to talk about the baby.
Faint.
Stick around, please?
My father!  He's not - ?
I don't know.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Listen!  Hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Seems to be all around...
I...don't know!
Yes, Griff?
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
After torpedo room:  Report!
Take a look.
Thirty-four seconds!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
I'll be another!
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
No.
Chub says you're fired.
How soon?
This spring.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
I hear Twombley got shot.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
We bought you.
That was me.
You think so.
Double A. New Britain.
They said.
Hmm.
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
In the chest.
No, I mean whereabouts.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Yeah.
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
What?
I don't care. They're out.
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
What then?
It's stupid.
No what?
Jesus, why?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
It belongs to Pop.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Fine.
I know.
You're a policeman.
I want to go home.
Okay, let's go home, then.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Yeah. A few things.
I'm fine, fine.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Could be.
Where's Jill?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
Okay. She's fine.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Wade.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
You're not using it today?
When did she die?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
She's coming.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
You and me.
Wade?
Twombley.
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
How was she?
Get some sleep.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Want to know what I think happened?
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Don't you even want to ask?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
Jim... for godsake!
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Put your pilot on.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Stay cool.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
To swear you in as President.
Why?
Ga get it.
Any of us?
why did they do that?
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
Three...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You'll do it?
One thing I've learned as
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
This is the President.
Yeah, right.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
What's the story?
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Dunn.
Sir?
Te...!
Ask Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted!
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Now!
Compute!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
That's my girl.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
That's not possible.
You have great tits.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
What...?
I'm sure.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't try to stop me!
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Thank you. Cream?
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Well...not for another two hours.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
He had fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Ted!
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
Every day.
Good-bye, darling.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I'm Randy.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Huh?
Huh?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Yeah...
That's right.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Show me.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
Here?
Do it!
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing?
And that fits?
And still it fits?
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why'd I do what?
Back off, George.
I'll handle it.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
We all did.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Fuck procedure.
Ss-ai!
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Harcourt is dead.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
What's that?
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
You?
I can't!  Do you mind!
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
How long until it blows?
What?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Well, thanks, I --
Hear me out...
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Dead on all channels.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
They're but off!  Do something!
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Do it!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Stand back.
We ain't going anywhere.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
You're just reading me.
Uh, what's next?
Seal the door.
It's readin' right.  Look!
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What about me?
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Gone.
You mean dead.
Wah...?  Where are...?
I know, honey.  Me too.
Can we dream?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
Good morning.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
In a harem.
What's that?
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
You might be disappointed.
What?
Don't bother.
I'm so relieved.
I want to go!
Yes!
Why?
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my - ah!
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
I don't know.
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Why not? Half the house!
I heard voices.
Why not?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Why not?
It's killing me.
I understand.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Isn't it obvious?
Where's our friend?
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
Be careful!
Adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Who was your teacher?
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Ah-ha!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
I think so, Sire, yes.
And German?
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Yes, what about him?
Am I not welcome?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
Yes.
Yes.
How many?
It's a secret.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Bene! Bene!
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Sssh! Stay here.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Why not?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Mio caro Adone.
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
Herr Sommer.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I can't say. Really
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
What dead? Who is dead?
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I do.
No! No, it's him!
What man?
He knows. He knows!
Do you believe in it?
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
Common time.
Sing it back.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Also identical?
I think so.
Show me.
Do you have it?
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Then you must know this.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Do you believe it?
Should I?
No? Was Mozart a good man?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
I've seen the manuscript.
Never mind.
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Well done, Sire!
What? Who the devil are you?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Well, promise then.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
How did he look?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
Yes, I believe he did.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Is David acting strangely?
No, not really.
Yes, I should think so.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
It was a wolf.
A wolf.
Yes?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Alex!
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
A werewolf?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Good.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Pull over.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
I swear, I don't know this girl.
David, let's go now.
No.
No what?
No.
No.
Right.
No!
I thought not.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
There's no call for that kind of language.
No. You've had your chance.
I was having a nightmare.
What are you going to see?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
So they said.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Good.
David.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Shall we?
It's a five-pointed star.
Wrong.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I have no idea.
I heard that.
What was it?
A coyote.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I don't know. Come on.
Come on, where?
Plan?
Do you think it's a dog?
Walk away, Jack.
No.
Not far enough. Come on.
Yeah.
Are you going to help me up?
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
I can't stand it.
What?!
What?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
What do you think?
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Thank you.
How shall I do it?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I beg your pardon?
I don't rightly know, sir.
Yeah - sure!
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
You understand?
Why, of course.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
That don't do us any good.
We can take blood from anything —  If it's comin' to us.
You don't have to do nothing.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Well, what?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Don't you know?
No.
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Yes, now.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
No.
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning.
Mr. Sampson . . .
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
You haven't got a uniform?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Why pick on him ?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
What are you talking about?
Did you get the case for the securities?
Mine too?
Absolutely.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Come here, honey!
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars—
Yes.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
They must have turned him down.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
It couldn't have been earlier?
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I don't know.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I guess so.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
It's tougher than it looks.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
I think I recognize you.
I could use the walk.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
She got two of them.
She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
I got three.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
And I'm the better outlaw.
A trap.
Pass me some whisky.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Ah.
They gonna rush us?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
I had you covered.  From back there.
Died a hero.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
Hell of a war.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You are a charmer.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
Heard of him.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
And we're good at it.
If I could go back to farming --
Oh yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Yeah Jimmy?
A fair number, Ma.
Say your prayers?
Boys?
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Shush.
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
And what's this right girl like?
Little ones.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Swimming. Swimming is good.
What?
Yes ma'am.
But I like the presidential suite.
Mmm.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Was it worth it?
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Right here in church?
No.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
This time we'll make an exception.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Lyla Devereux.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
I'm doing you folks a favor --
By burning down their homes?
Move you fools!
Just perfect.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
We did.
What is going on here, man?
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
What is that?
What, sir?
I remember you.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It's going to be a long winter.
It's going to be a long spring.
No.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
On a lot of lithium?
Yes?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
Pick me up?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Yes.
Yes, dear.
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Why?
You and...Luis?
You never noticed.
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Yes, darling?
We should do it.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Yes, I am.
We never really shared one.
I'm just leaving.
How did you guess?
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
The message you left.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
New card. What do you think?
This.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just say no?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Yes, Patrick?
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Interesting.
Forget it.
Jean? What?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Just...say...no!
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
What do you think I do?
No. Flattering, but no.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Yeah.
She's from...France.
Why would I?
Paul Owen.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
No, really. I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
No problem. 
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
So was I.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
People just...disappear.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Not a big music fan, eh?
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
I'm so hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
'Gonna wait outside.
I can paint anywhere.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
I know, I know.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What're you -- what?
It was a hate crime.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
So you believe me?
Nothing?
Remember Lyle Barton?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
What?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Great.
It's gonna get cold.
That'll be a test, won't it?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Is it your dish?
Oh hi.
We could move 'em up here.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Well -- you sent for me.
Were the flags for Teddy?
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
'Have a look?
Sure.
'Sorry about the late notice...
Maybe we should all get on it.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
What?
Just do it.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You know mine.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
She saved my life.
He's out of prison?
Hmm?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I don't know --
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
What'd he say?
You'll come up with something.
Bring it to the other location.
But you said the other --
Let's try #2.
What?
Uh. Not exactly.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
Did you tell Alice?
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Yeah, yeah.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
Where is he?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Kiss me.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
There's one more thing, Austin.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
What?
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Thanks.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Why not? It's a question.
Love is... love is... love is...
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
My wedding tackle.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Why?
I am not.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
You know who.
Not now, Austin.
Fair enough.
Don't worry!
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.  Scott!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Show me.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
You didn't...
We don't judge here.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
No, he's really evil.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Red ...

Peter ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
There, look!
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
As you see.
I have an appointment.
Eh? In here!
We have met ...
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
I meant me.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Any ideas?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Is there anything that isn't?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Orders.
To kill me?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Shall we?
Where are you going?
What kept you?
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Makes two of us.
Getting to what?
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Insane ... ?
Mother and Father know best.
In your operation.
I think so, thank you so much ...
This way ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Stay by the window. By the window.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Check out the other guy's buns.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
Bond... James Bond.
Cole...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Not interested.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
I love that car.
I'm very happy for you two.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
Mr. Thomerson.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Thank you, sir.
Keep me informed.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Why don't you get undressed.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
You're on.
Yeah.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, we don't really know that.
I hope those guys are all right.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
What are you...
That's more like it.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Very.
Who's your friend?
I'm saved. Let's party!
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
He's alive.
Just come down, John. Just --
Who asked you?
It's comin' along... want a beer?
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Hey.
Yeah... too bright...
Brian, look --
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Saw what?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
How do you know?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Jennifer.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
How's it going?
Well, you did invite me here.
Got anything to drink in there?
I wanted to be a good one.
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Just take it.
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Pest control.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Just wondering.
You look like... Brian.
Four months?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Nice boat.
Engine 115, right?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
Cute.
He just wants to --
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
You treated me like shit.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
Alderman.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
Me?
I forgive you.
I want 15 on the Mets.
Yeah. I'm sure.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
Don't bullshit me.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I'm on it.
Did he gots to be.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
Louder.  They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Give me some?
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Yeah, him.
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
Why are you smiling so?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
She's also moorish.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
You ain't happy about the green light?
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
What are you talkin' about?
I'm out.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Manray needs a job.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
Did we get our bill yet?
EUREKA!!
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
You're now Mantan.
Mantan!!
I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Always keep 'em laughing.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
The big one.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
The pleasure is mine.
Is that good or bad?
I don't want to hear it.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He, I'm Mona.
Hi, Mona.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I'll be right over.
Yes he did.
Where is he?
I can't go all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Not at all?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Thank you.  And always smile.
You've never had any formal training, either?
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
To come back to our roots.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
She hates dem.
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
You don't read, do you?
For what?  He left.  Not me.
What?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Don't try to change to the subject.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
That is none of your business.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I never was more in earnest.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
All Europe shall hear of this!
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I have faced that problem before.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
As much as possible?
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
The Prince left him only that choice.
What is to be done?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, my little darling.
Yes?
Yes, he's fine.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Who?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Shut up.  West's dead.
What do you like then?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
That'd be my reaction too --
You saw West's body.
Of course --
But not Pike's.
You wanna bet?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
How do you know that?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
West... he's dead.
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Oh, come on --
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
What don't you know?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
No. Poetic justice, though.
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
Does Osborne agree?
You knew Sergeant West?
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
I lost a bet.
You're off to a late start.
Not the happiest of memories?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Little bit.
They got their stories straight.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
So did I.
Get in.
Isn't this how your story goes?
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
No death certificates. No crime.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nah.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
So you took off your shirt?
He whispered it in my ear.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
What.
Childs.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
It's too neat.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Good luck, kid.
Not yet.
I don't expect to.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Let's see it.
Don.
How would you describe him?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Was she nekkid?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
How did you know?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
Can I take your picture?
Well, it's not a short one.
You were talking about your wedding.
And I like you.
Okay.
Beats me.
You learned from the best.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
You owe me three-fifty.
True story.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Son?
Can we talk?
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
The river?
How what happens?
How I go.
Okay. Okay.
You say...
The River!
Story of my life.
How did you get so many?
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
Hello.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Probably tonight.
You don't have to.
I'm going with you.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's up with your father.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You know what for.
No I don't.
I paid for those guitar cases.
There's over eighty thousand here.
We'll stop then.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
He says he feels safe here.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
And...
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
He wants the money from your bank.
I'm so sorry.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
Yes I know.
They go.
I don't want to know.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
And. It's wrong.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
You didn't mind too much.
You don't understand you either.
Get out
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
Well what have you got?
Are you scared?
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
What's your name?
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Please.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
Maybe you will find out.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Just wanted to see.
Then start taking them seriously.
Yes?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Oh, she older than that.
Not if no one finds out.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
You liked what I brung ya?
When? Now? Oh. No.
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
Hey.
Well, that makes it easier.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Yeah.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Yeah.
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
How long... how long I been out?
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Why you got me chained?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.
No joke.
The... chain helps.
Nothin'.
You can handle it.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Why you say that?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Like I told you.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Hey.
What?
Yeah, I do.
Got in a little accident.
I just wanted some make-up.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Let go...
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Saving your life.
No.
Number five with a bullet.
In Rome, I'll bow.
Nick, we can't just --
I said let's go, Charlie.
First decent idea you've had.
I hope not.
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What'd she say?
Cool?
What does Charlie mean?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
If you give me one.
I wasn't expecting you.
Where would you look for the mafia?
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Yeah...
I can see that.
I stole them.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
There she is!
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
You were too far behind.
Shut-up.
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
A resort city, Beppu.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
It's illegal, Nick.
Nick, you can't do this.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I can't...
Joyce?
I don't know.
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Luck.
Yes...
Call for help.
We can't lose.
He gets as much as he wants.
I don't think so.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Unavailable.
You could fake it.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
The cheese...
No one's keeping him here.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
I'm amused.
Don't be.
Dope?
He was my partner.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
He'll be dealt with.
I'll pay you.
You want him dead too.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
If he won't cooperate?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
You're androids.
Like what?
Like...
You could help us.
His company made us.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Garbage man?
You didn't like her!?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Why, yes, of course.
You start.
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
It's okay.  Forget it.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry, don't have the time.
Ya.
Prosit.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Let's hear it.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
Too old.
But if you could?
Me too.
Yes?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
For holes.
You mean the snake.
Come on.
Sorry.
Of course not.
Why should I be?
It would be my child.
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
I think you need more help than you've got.
I'm sorry.
Can you?  I couldn't.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
Oh.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I wish I could.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I never felt better.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Just wait here.
Holden got hit.
Black?
The machine works.  She is.
Almost through.
Sorry.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
Pris.
They left.
What about friends?
You scared me.
Just better.
Thanks.
What's your problem?
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
He's really funny!
Your mom was a dancer?
For how long?
Well, that depends...
Oh, brother...
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Are you French?
No, you get out of here.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Nope.
And that's it?
Yes.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Over this?
I know a short-cut.
Take it. damn it!
I haven't brushed yet.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Thank-Q!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
Very funny, smart ass.
What?
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
Yes.
What for?
The big one!
It does?
Sure.
Everybody's divorced.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am!
Stop that ma'am crap!
I told you I've never driven before!
Is this your house?
I like it.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
In the house?
Do I look crazy?
No way.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes, sir.
Of course!
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
No. Sit down.
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
Yes, sir. It's true.
You nut!
Juneau.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
It's so small.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
The recovery is very impressive.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Yeah...Seems to.
Goodbye.
The hotel.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
How old do I look?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky!!!
I don't see anything!
Just look!!
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
Well, we're here to help!
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Yes.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
Good god.
Yeah.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
I never know anymore.
Yes.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
To you maybe.
The locks?
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
How could you?! This is just like home!
You have tranquilizers?
What?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
What?
Hi.
Coming!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
We do?
Excuse me.
I want him to at least see the sky!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Oh, my God...
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I think...it...works.
He's from Alaska.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
To bed.
To bed?
Or have perfect table manners.
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What?!
And if we can't find him?
Yeah! That's thinking.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Where?!
Stop!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
It's blue. Blue velvet.
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
See my nipples?
Yes.
Yes, I like you.
No.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Yeah, hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
Are you a bad boy?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
I want you to stay with me.
I think I better go.
No.  Hi baby.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don? Where is he?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
Baby wants to fuck.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Good, let's drink up.
This is it.
Be right down.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know. He moved away.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Let's go.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Okay, yeah, call.
He got a little jealous.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Okay, Sandy.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Jeffrey? Why?
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
You look beautiful.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Dorothy Vallens?
Yes.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Sandy?
Go ahead!
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
The Duke?  What did you do?
What did you do, Connor?
Got it.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
This is a six-shooter.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
You think they sold me out? No way.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Know any other languages?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
Shut it. It's Ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
No pictures, either.
...so that which is good may flourish
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
A bit.
Me, too.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes, we are.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
He's a good man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Yeah?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Of course they were. How many?
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Where's my cat?
It was... It was...
Male or female, bitch?!!
Really want to know?
The fat man.
The Sicilians.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Y'know it is, a bit.
What the fuck do you mean?
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Y-Yes my son.
Yes.
You feel?
Yes.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
He says. This is he.
This is he?
No. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
That's not bad.
Hang on a second.
Just turn right here.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
What do you think?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Inez, this is --
On the left.
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
I'm not. But there's --
That's not correct.
Where's the rest?
$383.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
I know that. But --
Ah. Couple days ago.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Get out of the way.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was all right.
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
Any activity?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Applejack! What's happening?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
I don't know.
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, Kumar.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
We're not sure.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
He stole a tractor.
No. I'm not.
How?
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
What do you mean?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Death.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Who?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
See you, Bob.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
He looked too shaken-up.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Jesus Christ! No.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
I didn't do anything.
God, yes. Like silk.
Yeah.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Where were you?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Wait a second.
That's your friend Anthony?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
You're the faggot.
Not even for emergencies?
Let's cut the bullshit.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, Dignan.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Maybe she turned.
That's your domain.
OK.
God DAMMIT.
Did we get it?
Don't count it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I told you they were there.
I don't know.
What the fuck possessed you?
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
I can't do that, Bob.
I know it's not.
Anthony. Bad news.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
That's OK.
Yeah?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Where's Applejack?
Run. Run. Let's go.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Here we go.
Wait a second --
Now!
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
He's damn good.
Why?
Well, I think --
Who? Applejack?
Can't get it. It won't... 
What can we do?
He left his sweater.
No. I just have short hair.
No, my friend knows her.
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Come on in!
It's locked.
Good to know you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
There was a mistake.
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Had to be done.
No good options left?
Thanks.
Okay... 
I killed them.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Sorry. Old habits.
He's dead.
Who sent you to Greece?
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
I'm sorry.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
-- it hasn't been two years --
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
We can't wait to be sure.
What?
-- where? -
-- it's just him? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Tell me later.
But you found another choice.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
You hear me? I believed you.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
I want to hear it from you.
What do you mean?
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
Bourne?
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
You didn't answer my question.
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What? The tapes?
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Who's this?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Are we locked up?
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You mock us with a smile?
Hamish, I... thank...
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
You win.
I will not.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Thank you for inviting.
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
...Tonight!
I need you so much! I love you!
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
They've tricked us.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Great. I'll see you soon.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I don't know. These things take time.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
What do you mean?
He's a fucking maniac!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What's wrong with you?!
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yes?
I should have known.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Oh, yes.
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
A champagne cocktail, please.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
The stairs from the street.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Won't you join us?
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
No, Victor, no.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We'll discuss it later.
He suggested I ask you.
-- Yes?
Yes.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
Any time.
Right.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I said, ask your wife.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
Here it is.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Goodnight.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, Captain.
How about New York?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
The clipper to America.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
Victor Laszlo?
His escape.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
-- Thanks. I will.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Go ahead, Ricky.
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Uh huh.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Sacha, she's had enough.
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
Get me the Radio Tower!
I don't want them here overnight.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah?
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Worse than Warsaw.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Get up, damn you.
You've had today's water.
Do too little you'll die.
Going to die anyway.
No.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
Why do they have to die for me?
No!
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You are.
As much as anybody.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Had a package to deliver.
Cold.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
For when I travel?
I have to.
You want to.
Yes there is.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
I would have done the same thing.
Is that Jango?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Not when you have no choice.
Great.  Really.
You too.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
I most definitely say I am.
Yeah.
Mom, meet Jango.
The place is falling apart.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Want to see my raft?
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
To Wilson.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
No sweat.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm sorry, Homer.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
I doubt it. She's just an...
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Burma!
Oh...
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
"King Kong". It's really good.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
*What* will be okay?
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't...
She knows how to take care of herself.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Nobody ever wants me!
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Did you grow up around here?
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Migrants?
What about the trees?
You still doin' it too fast!
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Yes, for both.
I don't know it.
It's my turn!
I don't think so.
You do it then.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
It's just my heart.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
That's it.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
It look nicer then home!
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Ten percent. Of how much?
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
After you cut her loose.
Today? Started off great...
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
But you won't get that splatter effect.
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
She's up for it.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Why not?
Let me repeat -- Why not?
I think two million.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Good boy.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
I'll worry about Customs.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
What about what?
What about the money?
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
My place.
You sure we're clear?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
This is embarrassing.
Stand up.
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
In over your head?
Pretty much.
The King.
So what do you want?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
We're here.
That's it?
To who?
That's what I'm talking about.
Jack Manfred.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
Maybe another time.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
I can imagine.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
What's the Blue Book price?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Seven-fifty.
All right. As what?
I'm working on that soccer story.
She.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Not particularly.
And your lady?
You mean I won't resist them.
I won't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I. sold the car.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I want to hear it.
What job?
It came my way. 450 a week.
I love you Jack, you know that.
I don't know.
Tension. It'll go.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Probably.
What about a drink on the way home?
Why not?
Leave it.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
Never. Why do you ask?
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
No.
Don't let yourself down.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
In the casino.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Turn left ahead.
I'll watch.
You don't like cheats, do you.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I owe a lot of money.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
What ten thousand pounds?
What about my neck?
Let it go.
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Who...
Ross.
I'm Lucy.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Over the river.
She's my baby.
I'm not going to report it.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
It was you, you shit.
I was at Beadles.
Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
You won't. Not without permission.
I said good call.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Yes.
He's a good customer.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
Oh, God...
It didn't go off.
Doolittle, are you there?
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Arm yourself, bomb.
Do you remember the detonation time?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
This is fun.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes, Doolittle.
Yes.
Any of 'em any good?
Commander Powell is dead.
Wha?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
Ah, negative drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
That's correct, sir.
Doolittle, hello?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Guess again.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
Police drone.
What?  Where're we going?
No way.
Don't look down.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
A grand.
I'll make it worth your while.
Am I?
Every week.
They took my daughter.
I know.
Look, I'd really like to...
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Mommy, where are you?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
I'm not a half bad cook.
You got a lotta nerve.
Bent.
That would be appropriate, yes.
We are not fine.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
The other one like you...
You lost me.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Open it.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
I think you should go now.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
I'm on my way.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What?
You know what I'm saying.
Where?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
So are dogs.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
I have sincere eyes.
You get it when I get her.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
What if he's on the level?
Right, the big one-oh.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
What's up?
But there's another side--
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
Say the words, "I understand."
I want you on call here.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Yeah, a man's drink...
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Oh, screw it!
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
One more time in English.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
The paint!
Nah. Couldn't be.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Hawk?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
NOW!
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
Yeah.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah, you did!
Good morning...
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Donnie.
Beg pardon?
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Donnie! Give it back!
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You know what? I think that you did it.
Our saviour...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
Hey...
School's cancelled.
I'm sorry.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
Yeah?
Well...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Infant Memory Generators.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
Where are we going?
Who's Frank?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Where it came from?
I know, Dad.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I don't own a television.
Follow him where?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Can anyone else see him?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
That I did it again.
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Where is he, Donald?
Goodbye, Donald.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
He was a year ahead of us?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Kitty...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
She's right over there.
You-betcha.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Oh-you-beccha.
Huh?
I love you much.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Here, have some.
Hi.
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
The bitch.
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop!
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything.  He should be king!
Take a letter.
Who to?
You do and I'll fire you.
Send for my car...
His Excellency's car!
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Take a letter...
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
What's the matter with you?
All right -
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
I can't do it right away.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
You worm!
You upstart!
Yes.
THEN IT'S WAR!
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
That's it...
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Two, please.
I've always thought that myself.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I found it.
Did you see it?
Like this. 
I'll get my bag.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
He fell.  He falls.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Never mind that, I want my man!
I want him back!
Good morning, sir.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
No, more of an acquaintance.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Are you comfortable here?
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Alas, no.
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Good morning.
Where did you get this box?
The main spire.
Yes John!
Yyyess.
Yyess.
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
The hospital?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Here.
Good morning.
...Can you cure me?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
Yes. John wants it.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Pardon me?
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Who, Father?
But, Father, it IS!
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Yes.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
You're as bad as my father.
And the week before that?
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Erik. You don't understand.
Goodbye, Aud...
Then let go!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
I will go and wake them up!
That I cannot tell you.
Well... isn't it great?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Really.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
You've got to let me go!
He wants to kill US!
Shut up.
Oh, get it over with.
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
Oh, thanks.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
What?
Come on, move it!
It saved my father!
What's it all about?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
So? What'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
The sun! That's it!
What "magic"?
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
You'll be sucked down too!
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
How about making friends?
What are you talking about?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
We haven't got a spare place.
DEATH!
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
No, it is NOT.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I... I...
You could charge him what you like.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Can't make enough axe-heads!
That's right.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Well... I... I thought...
YOU do it!
I'm drowning! Help!
Help!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I know, Dad.
I must only let the red rage...
I must KILL! Kill!
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Easy, Dad!
Me too.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I told you that later.
You did? You liked me?
Hi.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
I was not.
In the world.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Okay, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Why?
Why what?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You're sure? It's cold.
Yeah?
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
I like to read.
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
No, I'm okay for now.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Yeah? Oh, great!
When?
Tomorrow?
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
You're not ready.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
No. Thanks.
Yeah, Tangerine?
What do you mean?
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Yeah.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
But you weren't. I could tell.
And I didn't have an argument.
Come up and see me... now.
Not yet. Not married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hi.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I'm Joel.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Me too. There's this poem --
Seems too coincidental that way.
Female.
I love you.
When?
Tomorrow?
Have sex. Y'know --
Oh, um...
Well, you obviously don't know me.
A bully? Moi?
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Doesn't sound like me.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I probably got the same thing as you.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
How's it going?
Long day thinking.
I'm like a joke to them.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
What? What do you mean?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
Hi.
How was it?
Go back to sleep.
I hope you get your work done.
I'm glad you called.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
'Night.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Hi.
Sorry. I just --
I know. Anyway --
You found us okay?
What?
I don't know! I just said that!
You better go.
Hell no.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
Hi.
Can I... I brought some --
Nothing.
Then why did you ask me?
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Welcome, Howard.
How do you mean?
You are such a sweetheart.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Then check the connections.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
I know who you are.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
I'm staying with the Countess.
You don't?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Well.... er...
Why? Why do you have to go?
I was a successful model once.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I heard it.
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Hold on, Coop...
I'll get him.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Coffee.
No, thank you.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
You're okay now, it's over...
Run!
Nothing. It's nothing.
A power drain --
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
What's on your mind?
The dark inside me.
From the Other Place...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
Frozen.
Crystallized.
Peters...
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
That's what we're here to find out.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
If it worked, yes.
What about it?
You said this ship creates a gateway...
It's done.
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You know.
Better if I just show you.
What is that?
Dr. Weir...!
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Where is it?
Starck, give me a read.
We have a situation here...
We don't have time to fart.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Come again, Skipper?
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Oxygen is not the problem.
No. It was someone else.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Justin's in the airlock.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
Blow it up?
He's dead...
He served on the Goliath.
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
I did.
Can you shut it down?
I don't care.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
We're losing atmosphere...
Decompression wouldn't do that.
I'm trying, goddammit --
Ship's log.
The forward airlock.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
Oh, he did.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben. Are you okay?
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
So are you!
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Dude. That's my sister.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
What? What do you mean you --
If it happened to him, then it could...
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this?
I understand the business reasons.
Raising the shields.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Oh, I think you already have.
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
It's the first door on your left!
First door on your left!
There it is!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Sis.
Why can't you do it?
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
You're fired.
Dad says!
Nice to meet you.
Sure. Come on in.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
No. It's too soon.
Really?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Yeah?
Damone. It's Mark.
Damone! You come here?
Okay. See ya.
Really.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I don't go at all.
That's me, Merv.
Naw. Any good?
All right.
I like sex.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
My brother is gonna shit.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Should we buy a frame for that?
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What's the big deal?
There's nothing to it.
It was okay.
Hey! That's my line!
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I think they're both virgins.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
What do you think it is?
I want romance.
He's not coming.
Not coming? What happened?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I don't know. I guess so.
You're gonna flunk me?!
How about your phone number?
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
No. I mean back to your home.
You keep them.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Oh yeah.
Two more Cokes.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you really have to go?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
I'll get you the notes.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Righto!
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Not where we operate.
Naked.
What?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
He wanted the pineal gland.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
This is my granddaughter...
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Why what?
I have to go.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Whatever's right.
Lucy.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
They were all veterans.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Extract of pineal!
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Never missed a plane yet.
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
You and a lot of other people.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
Nah, I got the gun.
But it's got teeth.
With what just happened upstairs --
We're lucky to be alive.
Upstairs.
OPEN THE DOOR!
Hey!
Get in line!
No. You?
What?
Look.
Why don't you go check it out?
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Yep.
We lived near power lines.
Anybody else?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
What?
Four door?
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Keys.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
No bullshit.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
MOVE YOUR ASS!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
HELLLPPP!
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Nothing, just lookin'.
YOU'LL HIT US!
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Whoa!
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I admire your strength.
I think --
I just hit it like you said.
Putting on my armor.
Who's this?
Very fine bone structure.
You see: We've got to change that name.
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
You're afraid!
I'm not!
Thank you.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
Oh.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
A rich actress.
What does Clifford say?
In my eyes, officer.
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Without me.
Showdown.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
You really want to go?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you too, Francie.
Daddy!
Thank you.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Fifteen.
Address?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
What about your husband?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
Enh.
What?
Eight stories.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Is that why you did it?
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Think I'll have a glass.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
What?
...Take advantage of me.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
You can't drink.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Will you marry me?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
I love you too, Frances.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
No, we're not.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Just a little way.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
What'd you do?
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Who're you?
I live here.
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
You got it.
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Go on...
At one. Promise?
Sure.
Mama...?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Yes...?
I don't believe so.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
Normal. Average.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Sedate her.
'Incurable.'
I was watching.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
It can't be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
There, there... shhh...
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
And you look so lovely.
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
The world is a dizzying place.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
I wish to be your husband.
Not as weak as I.
Your decision. For us.
I give you my soul...
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Now husband and wife.
It wouldn't dare.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Oh God.
As a march hare.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Can you think of a better reason?
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Victor, explain yourself.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Are you a physician?
You know of it?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
My name is Frankenstein...
I will protect you.
Right! Right!
I was careless.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Good night, Brenda.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
Thanks, Alice.
You okay?
Artist.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Not if they're where I think they are.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
I meant everything.
Somebody'll see.
No, they won't...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Thanks.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
That was the telephone.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
Don't call him.
Mmmmmmmph.
Umhummmmph.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Aw.
One night on the town.
For two lonely nights.
Another coincidence.
Yeah.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
So let's do it.
I have no idea.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Jacob.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Come again?
My wife.
She's dead?
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Why'd ya quit?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
No, I didn't.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
To yours.
In other words, no.
Yep.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
Scott?
Everybody goes home!
What's in Mexico?
Mexicans.
You asked me if I would --
Noooo!
Anytime.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
What dya mean?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
Shut up and start the car.
One... Two... Three.
-- This conversation is over.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
What?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Or what?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
No problem, lieutenant.
The woman I saw you with...
But are there... I mean, how many...
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Standing right here in my office.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
No, sir, WHAT?
Across the board, sir.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Motherachrist...
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Did you hear?
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
California.
Yes, dear.
Sounds familiar.
You'll think about my offer?
'Snot me.  It's him.
Sir?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What about him.
What?
Well, now I feel so much better.
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me.  You?
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
I don't know...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
You heard me.  Move on.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
No.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
North?
Darth Vader reads poetry...
We are so fucked.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
O'Neil, Jordan.
You knew about us?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Go in there. Talk to her.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
But we can get to the west side faster.
You must have quite some harem.
Are you sure?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
It's your choice.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Really? A girlfriend then?
Well, I think you're cute.
Allez, allez!
They didn't make it.
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
It's Tatopoulos.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
We've met before.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
It's the French Secret Service.
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
We, have already taken care of them.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Makes us look more American.
It's okay. I know her.
It's Raymond.
Where are you?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I won't and nothing you say-
...Damn you!  Damn you!
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Nothing.
Yes. Good was done this .....
I played Richard III...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Nobody was WATCHING?
Yes you did.
What's  your name, son?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
GO Commander.
What?  Up?
There is no weather in space.
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
Never mind, Fred....
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
You... know us?
Something BAD happened here.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Only answers to me.
But I'm the Commander!
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Let me think. I need time to think.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Nothing. Hold please.
What the hell are you talking about?
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Simpler.
But what if Sarris survives?
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
NO, Thank God he has not.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
But... Inside, I have seen-
It's as far as it goes!
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Tommy, we have these...
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
I wish she was beneath me.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
It is.
The army can survive without me.
I?  You all know my history.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
What?  What are you talking about?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
You invented this, this...
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Detained by what?
The British army, sir!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
What's the difference?
How can you say that?
And how rusty are these muskets?
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
I don't want to see your hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
But not more than your comfort.
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Voltaire, of course...
Just because they are born?
I say!
I see...
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
No. What's this?
Calm down, Bear...
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Harry, let me answer that.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
What about her?
Get something going there.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
What money?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
She can't talk right now.
I'll find it.
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Sovereign.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
Not yet. I just started.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Never say anything unless you have to.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
It was in the Herald.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I'm looking at you.
That's not bad.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Compass.
I'm up twelve grand today.
Sit down, Leo.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
What're you doing here?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
I just caught the end.
Not yet.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Go get your stuff.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
I'm going.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Chili and me.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
Say again. Over.
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
Wrong. It's Friday.
Why not.
What?
Maureen.
Roger?
Yeah.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What're you crazy?
I like my job.
Gimme a break.
Oh yeah.
Right. Wednesday.
What?
Yeah, yeah.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Threw a turbine blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
The right way and the wrong way.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Could be meant as a warning.
Murphy.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Maybe you can tell me then.
What?!
What the fuck -- ?
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Probably didn't have time.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
I feel fine.
Yeah. Thanks.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Only way to be.
Did you see him?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
You sure it wasn't me?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
If it was a ship she hit.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
I don't know, are we?
What happened.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
Epps, over.
Right here.
We hit land.
What?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
Go.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Looks like it's adrift.
How's that?
Sorry.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Moving to Sweden.
Lost my sea legs.
You don't remember?
A what?
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
Better late than never.
What's this?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
Give up?
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
God, how horrifying.
Nothing.
Are you going to yell at me?
JUST DO IT!
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I...
I didn't check my messages...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Jesus...
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Hi.
Can I come in?
When did I say I hated you?
Hey Josh.
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
That lets us off the hook.
Hey, look at this...
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
I've been looking all over for this.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Let's go hassle Josh.
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
Everybody's too stupid!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
He does that every single day.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
No, really...
God, you're really obsessed...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
When was this?
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
It's fine.
I dunno...
Maybe an orange juice.
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Who does?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Get a job!
Fine, and how are you?
Did you bring that tape?
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Five hundred.
A dollar seventy-five.
Watch my stuff.
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
PLEASE? We have to!
OH MY GOD!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
For nineteen years...
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Are you okay?
Never...
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
So, what happened?
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
YAAA!
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Does that mean you don't like me?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
What do you want?
I-I-I...
I will if you want to.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Call me sometime.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know... where is she, then?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Yes?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
As are they all.
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
How; we don't know where they are?
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Don't they, though?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
We have hunted since childhood.
Might be exciting for you.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
That's what the books say... 
You mean nobody died?
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Have you ever failed?
Only in life... 
I got big. 
Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
Hold your son high. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
No.  Not that I can recall.
Okay, that's no problem.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
I'll supervise.
Okay, let's take a look.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Thanks.
You're really good, you know.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
You were the one who got me in.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Hello, Venkman.
I don't even want to know where that is.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
And we're the ...
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Well don't think!
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
And decent.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Hi, Louis.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I am Zuul.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
It's in the stars.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
No?  What do I act like?
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I told you, I ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You heard it?
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
In the physical sense.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Why do you want to see it?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Good guess -- but no.
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
What on earth gave you that idea?
What have you got, Egon?
Wow!
Yeah, I can smell it.
Why not?
What do you mean "bad?"
Oh, shit!
Gozer.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
But it's my favorite state.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
Anything!  Just make contact.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
How do you know?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
For the gods, spit it out!
You're coming back?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
I'm serious.
So am I.
He left us at dawn.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
But have never been?
We all know what right is, Senator.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
They fear me.
On my honor as your daddy...
Well, they die for it!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
I can see that...
Quintus is overly idealistic.
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Hello.
I'd love some.
No.
I don't know.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
Where is the car?
But could you try?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
Of course not.
Yes.
With a family?
I'm glad.
Benjamin -- I really do.
That woman --
What?
You mean the one who --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
Get out of here.
Ah. Where?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Yes.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Here he comes.
What?
Is it because I'm here?
I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
I don't understand --
Did you say rape her?
Let me go.
Goodbye.
What?
I don't know.
But you might.
I might.
When?
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
What?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
I certainly hope you --
Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Plastics.
Not exactly.
What are you then?
Oh -- no sir.
Who screamed?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Will you bring it in to me?
Did you get a room?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
That's right.
No. 
Let's go.
Right.
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
I don't know.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
Pardon?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
No.
Yes?
Won't you unzip my dress?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
I've got to go.
Yes.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
Do you want to?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Yes.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Yes?
Yes.
What?
Benjamin.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
A hanger.
What?
Either one will be fine.
You're welcome.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Wait a minute.
Well?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
I got up.
What?
What?
There's no risk?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
Now let's keep going here.
Thank you.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Is it?
Well how do you feel about him, then?
What?
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
At college.
Yes.
Art?
How do you think.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Why not?
There's nothing to tell.
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
Well, I'm not.
Of course you did.
Of course I wouldn't.
But it's not.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Then you'd better start believing me.
I don't think so.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hey -- I don't get it.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Nothing else.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
You don't?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
What about it?
Different.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
What?
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
Great.
Why?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, I can.
They are?  Come on.
That what he says. Right?
Not now.
Yes, sir.
The pearls are in her room.
No.
Why?
With the pearls --
You can't.
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, I am rather.
Have you seen it?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
Too bad.
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
All right. We'll dance.
Money.
I'll do anything for you.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Yes --
For tonight. 
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
No.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Oh -- 
I'll not denounce you.
So --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Shall I see you again?
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
Why later?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
On the train?
Bless you --
Not at all, sir. 
Oh, a Baron! 
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Ready, Baron.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
Yes, I was in the war.
I did not ask your advice.
I must have made a mistake.
Don't do that. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
No, doctor.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
I'm engaged for the evening.
A man might what?
You're trembling.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you like me better?
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover...
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover... 
Moreover...
What?
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing? 
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
What?
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Hello!
It's urgent.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
No -- now.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well?
A thousand marks -- 
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
I had to arrange about the trip.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
No water -- What a place!
Of course you took the initiative.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Let us cancel the engagement.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Take them back, Suzette.
Such nonsense.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Please.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Me?
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
You are late. Hurry.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No. No word.
I know -- I know.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
That.
Your what?
You expect me to buy this?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You want a drink?
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
No?
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
Only one tooth?
Don't mention it.
No. And you have to be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You do?
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
You're too young. You should be in school.
In your other hand.
Let's find out.
Mm?
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
I'll see you when you get home.
You ain't seen nothin.
See you soon.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
He retired.
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
Open it and find out.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
I don't think I need it.
That's what I say.
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Yes?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Oh, yeah. That's that.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
The cemetery...
I can be real stiff.
Care to join me?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Carter.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
I know.
I was trying to get away from someone.
I don't know.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
I borrowed it.
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Then you come out here.
Then I'll get caught.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Michael Meyers!
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
It's not going to happen.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
What?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
Can't you?
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You're so easy...
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
We can light our own tree at home.
What if it's Kara?
The voice man!  He's here!
He says things.  Bad things.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
I promise.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Here.  Let me try.
He's gone.
Wait a minute ...
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
I'll meet you over there.
Why did you take Jamie?
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
At least we found the diamonds.
The hell with the diamonds!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
How about breakfast, wife?
The educational process.
You know me, boy.
You told me.
When?
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
Out!  Out!
Hello.
Are you--
Ask it!
Life has denied me that thrill.
Is anybody besides you here now?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Mom?
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Make it fast.
Leave a tip.
Who was it?
It's Mom.
What's this?
Nothing.
Open the bolt!
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Heaven.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Situation.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
We thought a doctor might help.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Shouldn't you lie down?
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Do say hello to your mother.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
Ram it up your ass!
People don't use that word any more.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
What then?
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Did you like it, dear?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
If he thinks he's man enough.
What a handsome word.
No.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
You startled me.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
There's a certain amount of information there.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
And terror, if you don't mind.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
King Arthur.
You hope.
With spittle?
My violin is avenged!
I'm utterly satisfied.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
If you want to be found that way.
What is this thing that kills me?
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Premature ejaculation.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Don't!
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
What a relief!
I don't want to live any more.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Stay home tonight!
He's alive!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
It's beautiful.
Who have you been talking to?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's his name?
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
He can hardly talk.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
You're going out?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
Keeps fairies away!
He is my father.
That's something I suppose.
Is he coming home?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
Marry me instead.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The what?
It's suicide!
Paul's only twelve years old.
That's been said before.
We met here earlier this evening.
How neat.  How keen.
I believe in miracles now.
It's really that bad?
Goodbye.
Or get eaten alive.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
No, just not the type.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
What do you mean?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Just one.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
What girls you got here?
Man, how many girls do you need?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Yeah.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
How much do you make a week, Niki?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Huh?
Ulcers.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
I care about my daughter.
Tijuana.
They were here?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Is Kristen safe?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
What the crap?
No, please go on.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
On your own land?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
Where is he, Niki?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
You are.
That's right.
Mast?
Yeah.
In G.R.? Why?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
They are?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Who is Ratan?
I just heard. Who is he?
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Pretty good.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
I don't know.
Where!
I want to meet Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Who?
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
Com'on, tell me.
To anybody.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
You working in San Diego now?
Thanks.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
No, no. I just took it.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Is this your shovel?
Officer, I can explain.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Because if you are...
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
What?
No.  I thought not.
Yearse!
Oh.
Oh, look! The birds.
Well then.
Sort of.
Promise?
Maude???!
She seemed yare to me.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
It goes on and on.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Look.
What?
What is it?
But we can't just dig it up!
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
What is that he's working on?
Well, I really don't drink...
No more revolts.
Superb.
Yes. It's almost there.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Okay.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
With Life.
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
What is it, Harold?
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Yes. They're old friends.
Yes.
Here.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
It's all right. It's organic.
For you.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
To whom?
To a girl. Here.
Perhaps it is.
Can't complain.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
No. My uncle.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
Why?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Huh?
None at all?
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
To pit your own life against another.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
We've always been here.
Frank.
You knew?
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
I know.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
You a doctor, too?
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Kyle, you don't have...
It's been Hell.
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
You were ALL human!
The Cenobites.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
See? I don't like that --
-- Hound of resurrection?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Oh, I'll bet you have.
No. It's not.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
I think that is its hand.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Me?? C'mon --
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Did he, now?
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
My job.
Oh-n-no -- I --
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
Goodbye.
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not from you.
Well good n-
Good night.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Good.
...Polo.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Strong.
A brute.
I know.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
You did this before, right?
HE did. I've seen him.
No. That wasn't the deal.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Kirsty?
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
Poor baby.
Bastard.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Sure you are.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said: don't look.
Ssh!
Keep your voice down.
What?
Tell me, damn you.
I don't.
So where's the harm?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Just to your left.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
Ah!
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
In here.
Why not?
We'll move in Sunday.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
Let me see.
I'm going to throw up.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
I'm here.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
Kirsty.
I've seen worse.
No. I'll do it.
Don't go upstairs.
Come with me then.
Please...
Please. I can't bear it...
What are you talking about?
Drinking alone.
I wonder, maybe...
Plain soda?
Please.
Oh?
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
That's more like it.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
That's right.
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
I won't be a moment.
Try me.
Daddy?
I got through.
I found a room.
What did you say?
I said: I found a room.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
I will. See you.
You like?
Me like.
Kirsty.
Steve?
I love you too.
Maybe you should give it some time.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
He's gone.
Gone?
I don't believe it.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
Not that late.
She's so damn... English.
Oh no.
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
Can I lend you a hand?
What happened to you?
I won't let anybody take you.
Will you GO, damn you?
Sure. Why not?
'Bye.
I don't know.
Really.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Well what's the point in that?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What are you snickering about?
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Terrific.
What band?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You're not even coming?
Laura.  Her dad died.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
No way.
Yes way.  It's really...
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Nothing.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
He's not worth it!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
What do you mean, four more?
Is that it?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
What's his name?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Hey Rob.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
No, that's okay.  Really.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Who's that?
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Think about it, Rob.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Hi.
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
What, what?
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Nevermind.
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Great... That's great.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I don't have your number.
It's me.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You know what I mean.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Pigsty.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Mmnn.
What do you want to do?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
You know the difference.
But what?
More confident, maybe.
Harder.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
I know.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Are you persuadable?
So?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
What's happenin'.
You called this morning?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Enough of what?
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Everything go alright?
Thank you.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Nor have you!
Yes.  You?
Yeah.
Good.
That way.  You?
That way.
Right.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
How's the store?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Well we don't.
Whatever.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Huh?
It's in good condition.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Why?
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
Very traditional.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Probably.
Who?
I've been to Church Hill.
Tradition.
Dupont Circle.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
He was innocent.
You?
You are being foolish.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're a fool.
Maybe.
You've been listening to rumors.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
A little dusty.
I'd like you to try.
He is older than I.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Come here, Brenna.
Damn you.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
No!
Not power.  Not control.
I'm just curious.
You and I should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
Spare me the details.
I want Taupin.
It's that important?
Yeah.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
You're not from these parts.
I was nearly killed.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
Not even a single lifetime.
We are immortal.
It is the truth.
Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
Me arm hurts.
Again.  Try again.
It's like to kill me first.
I have no future husband.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Me father has taken back my hand.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Like you.
Kiss me.
Certainly not me.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
Mulet.
Second musketeer.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He knows I'm here.  How?
Kahn?
How did you find me?
He always did.
-Since you last saw me.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
As you wish.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Go to hell.
Get up.
Are you here?
That's none of your business.
I presume it's a sword.
For the moment.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Yes!
Where are we going?
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
No, you don't!
The power of the press, huh!
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
Sweeney.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
He's in the insurance business.
The insurance business?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Afraid? I should say not!
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Thanks.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
I know. Where is he, I said.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
All right, Walter.
Railroad tickets.
Finished!
Was she? Did you notice?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What is it? Here!
Who did you talk to?
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
You know you did!
You grey-haired old Judas!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
I'm busy, Duffy.
They can't do that to me!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I think it is.
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Point the gun at me!
Three bullets! Any good?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
So long, Hildy.
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
I guess so.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
What do you mean -- through?
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I did.  Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
Just -- one -- second!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
A sight for sore eyes!
Throw him out, Frank.
I never saw him before!
Go on -- shoot me!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
I'm telling you!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
I'll go right after it.
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
That's good.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
That man there!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Quiet, Mollie!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
How much do you make a week?
Who do you think!
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Is it hard?
You can't bribe me!
A very fine-looking women.
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
What's he want?
She and Mollie were talking.
I know.
Only till they get you into the local school.
No, she didn't.
What's that?
Say them.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
OK. You're in.
Would.
Could.
We thought it was poison.
He's the worst liar.
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
The sodding water table.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Naturally.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
And the bride.
You joined up.
Oh, that.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Half the time he's bluffing.
It's not. It's happening to me.
How are we going to cope?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
We did the decent thing.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
I wish it could all have been different.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Yeah, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Whoopie fucking doo.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Fucking great.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Hey, wait take this.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
But if you did.
I don't.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
No problem.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Yeah, showtime for what?
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
It won't work.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Rise and shine.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
You got to be fucking joking.
I don't know... about half an hour.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Recover any bodies?
Not yet.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Yes, sir.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
You said it, not me.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
What! God damn, how many?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Where we headed?
I ain't got a warrant.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
I pray to God there is.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
What.
That must be him.
We found one.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
Gabrielle.
Oui.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You are sweet.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Hi. It's Nathan.
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
No!
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Please let me go with you.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
Shan't happen again.
Very well.
Ouch. Yeah?
You still in the market for a real boy?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
And I think I'm going to.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
Lila, I want to help you.
Nathan told my brother.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Ready!
My God! The fork! The fork!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Yes, and...
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Flares?
Absolutely.
I love you so much.
Nothing. Be right out.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Good. Making progress.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Even better.
Yes?
Yes... Derek.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Next game, ten bucks.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
And a fact is a fact.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
Do we need words?
You tell me.
Good, good.
Oh, about five hundred.
Sit down.
Cut.
Deal.
Only when I work.
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Pool.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
For who?
For me.
I never saw you do anything else.
I don't know when it was.
Hi. How's business?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Where do I sign?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Well, I win sometimes.
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
All right. Five hundred.
They're fine.
I said we're leavin'.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
It's a long walk.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
You name it, we shoot it.
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
I feel tight -- but good.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
You don't need a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
That's right. When?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. You must come again.
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
Ten dollars.
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Shoot.
Okay.
Call it.
Heads.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Yours.
Eight o'clock.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Thanks. I will.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
What do you do on the other days?
Hey!
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Fifth of scotch?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Come here.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Okay. So what's your name today?
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, I forgot.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Oh, it's not bad.
Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.
Yeah. For a little while.
What's this supposed to mean?
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Me. It's Eddie.
No. You?
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what else does?
You need the words?
Yes, I'm glad.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Oh, I don't know.
Come here. Come on, now.
Oh, grow up.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
He went off someplace.
Just for luck.
I'm a little tired.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Thousand dollars a game.
That is not now, human!
My name is Robert.
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
Yes.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
My wife.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
I don't know.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
What?
Please.
That's fine.
You got that right.
Round back.
Do we have to?
That's the Air Force Base.
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
What, Jim, what?
It was so real, Dad.
Better now, son?
I left it at work.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Why, yes.  Why?
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
No, but it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
David? How'd you get this number?
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I take it you've heard.
He's a good man.
Did it work?
You bet it did.
What's the bad news?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
What're you talking about?
Haven't you been watching?
Just do it!
A countdown to what?
Checkmate.
So think already.
College nickname.
You try Martin?
It's perfect the line is busy?
He wasn't the President then.
What'd I say?
A cold? Of course.
We'll meet you there.
Just getting a feel for her.
I can't shake her free.
You as well.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Better than we thought.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
He's doing a good job.
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Be careful.
Dick-weed!
Butt-munch.
You know me...
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
We're already over Mach 2!
So push it!
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's all fuzzy.
Deploy.
Air... water... your "sun."
And before here?
Many worlds...
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
You are on your own?
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Did you say...? Uh, uh...
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
All my life!
What is it?
It looks like a converted church.
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
I'm going after Dad.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
Arghhh! Oh!
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
What?
It's war.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
The Name of God...
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Where did this come from?
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
We're through!
Yes?
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
In that case, I permit you.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Pretty sure.
What?
You said go between them!
I said don't go between them!
Mine, too.
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Don't know. Think of something.
Where is it? I want it.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
All I have to do is scream.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Out!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
Right.
Well, what was left of him.
If only I could have been with you.
You did!!
Don't worry. He won't.
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Try and burn through the ropes.
What?
Dad!
What?
Dad!
I'm out, Dad!
What?
Stop! Stop!
My Diary's in Berlin.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Marcus would agree with me.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Ships that pass in the night...
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Very well. I'm here now.
I don't know. We'll find out.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Thanks.
This could be close.
Get out of there, Dad!
Junior...
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready.
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
A long time to wait.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
No camels!
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
Lao She.
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Okay, Shorty.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Just a statue.
You don't like him do you?
Behind you!
You're betrayed Shiva. 
You will go to palace there.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
A SNAKE!!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
Just one arm!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
I know the feeling...
Maybe he likes older women.
No -- real food.
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Dr. Jones?
What -- the bug?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I am -- it looks horrible!
I'm going down.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I want to go home...
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
Go!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You got it!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
What for?
I know you did!
Who's you?
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
This candid camera?
I see...
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
You said it.
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Then I'm crazy.
Why he's argumentative?
Oh...Gooood!
Outrun them.
This is a Fiesta!
Then what are you stopping for?
Too late...They want you.
Why? AL  You know too much.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
No. Don't tell the guards.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You gotta help.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
What does it say.
Corridor A.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
The man.
What do you mean?
Black suits and helmets.
Don't know.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
I'm at the airport.
Good. Get to a phone.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
We get on which plane?
What about it?
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
It's illegal.
I'll get in trouble.
We'll change your appearance.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
You'll be me.
The beach.
The beach?
Just get there.
What is it?
...Just beautiful.
Good Idea!
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Eat it?
It's sand.
What? What do you mean?
Are you screwing with any nerves?
What was?
You're out of shape.
What's happening?
Try another language.
Which language?
How should I know?
Don't just stand there, say something.
.
Where are you staying?
What?
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
I made it work.
Yeah. I did it.
What are you looking at?
This...is not going to work out.
Not blue enough.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
That place. By the window.
Are you serious?
Just hold them close and stay still.
I don't know what's going on.
It lends you an air of mystery.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
You got any books in there?
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
I don't know!
Shit! You're in love.
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka?
Follow her.
On what?
Run, stupid!
I can't keep up.
Where are you going?
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Don't worry!
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
You have to! Quickly!
Neither can they.
You were with GRUNER!
Come on.
I've got an idea.
I was afraid of that.
Not sure at all.
While he makes the run.
And don't let her know, either.
What exactly?
I don't know.
Where've you been?
Now, you're too suspicious.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
What part what?
Don't give her your name.
Oh, I can't.
Good.
I insist.
Don't worry.
Let us get to the border!
ya hyutn slulptsa?
Then how did you know?
**?!! 
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
Surveilliance on them all.
We met on the beach.
That crazy guy?
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
I think I've heard of you.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
You'll feel better
I will?
What?
Take the card.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Why would we want to hurt you?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Been hearing voices.
You...him...UST.
I noticed you staring.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Yessir...very good sir.
What's what?
What do you want?
What?
I didn't say anything.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
Blake?
Dinner...tonight.
Oh...I can't. Business.
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
I waited for you.
...I...don't know.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Are you alright?
That you're not crazy.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You're doing...Okay.
Just Okay...
Who do you work for?
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
Why'd you run off?
Wanted to get to know you.
You seemed interesting.
What do you mean?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
Why did they leave?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
No.
Who did?
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
How do you know you can trust me?
Hiroshima.
Get your things.
Oh sure.
Beats me.
What?
I know the territory.
You coming along?
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
Can you?
I can't fly it.
What'd...you forget?
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
For you.
What?
I'll come back for you.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
I knew it. I told him.
We just don't stop.
Do something!
It wasn't me. It was him.
But you did it. It was you.
That's twenty feet high.
I know a nice island.
I don't know.
A drink...
Why?
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Thank you.
The other working.
Perfectly.
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
No?
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
So we better get started.
What about Al...
For reading.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Instant rice...?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Where?
In the backyard.
Yes, baby?
There's Dad, on TV.
Three hours.
You got a deal. 
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
I'll be there.
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Yeah. Catch you later.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
How about you?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, I love that stuff.
I'm afraid you are.
No, I'm not...
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Catch ya' later.
Are you sure?
"Mike?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Catch you later.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Yeah?
Yes, it's on the stove...
What do you need at the store?
Right now?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I'm doing an interview.
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
That's for food.
Who's calling?
Did you say Berman?
Yeah.
Let me call you back...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Oh, baby...
Jeffrey...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
I got perspective.
No, you do not.
...you fucked me!
Who is this?
Area code 212-555-0199.
I'll call you then.
Alright?
Okay. Thank you.
No shit.
What's this?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
What?
I think it was a disgrace.
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Did work.
If you want to do it.
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Good. I want to talk to you.
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
You okay?
No.
They do this with impunity!
I'll call them, Lowell.
Did you have a good day?
No. I mean since whenever...
No? No, what?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
You try and have a good time.
What?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
A delivery device for nicotine.
It acts as a drug on the body?
It acts as a...
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Excuse me?
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Triple!
Who's the pigeon?
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Grounds?
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
No frown lines.  New watch?
Set one side for Bel Air.
I should be in therapy.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
Well... I'm still...
You have the pre-nup?
What?
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
Ruth Rabino.
You like kids.
I said yes.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
I'll be right back.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Did you see the tape?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I told you. I was hungry.
You just haven't met the right person.
No. I haven't. Have you?
And you've always loved him?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
No, that's not all.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
Okay Miles.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
She didn't love you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
No, we're not!
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want... I want to...
You do?
I have a watch.
Fabric and fringe.
Hello Marylin.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
What kind of "stuff?"
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's marriage.
Marylin?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
I fell in love Miles.
It's okay Joe.
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Hello Miles.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
I thought so.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You have some?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
You used his credit card.
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?
I'm dying.
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Well, that's about to change big time.
When you have a moment.
She's here now.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Heh heh.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
Rex, please.
Now Rex.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
And she had private investigators assisting her.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
And she has...?
Video.
What the fuck...?
Sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Berry spoons.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Who's Rex's guy?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yes, sir?
How is she?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yeah.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Why don't you put me in chains?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America!
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Who is he?
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Yes. Peter Warne.
Oh, no—no.
Oh, please, Dad—
Are you going to see him?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Yes, of course.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
What happened to your money?
You win!
Yeah?
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
That's right. You didn't.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
You're on a budget from now on.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
The pleasure is all mine.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Where is the shower?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Um. You're doing all right.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
It takes money to buy food.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Yeah.
I'm following you.
Of course it is.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Well, take them off.
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
was—but—
But what!
Hay—in my teeth.
Raw?
You think it's simple, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Mind your own business.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Eat a carrot.
What happened?
Why not?
You're forgetting you're married.
Same to you.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
I'm out! I'm out!
Who—me?  Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Left twenty minutes ago.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
Thank you.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Eight o'clock.
Just your imagination.
What's 'at?
Huh?
Yes.
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Well, I got it, Joe.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
You!
Yeah.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Collect.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Zeke.  Git!
Yes, Ma.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Orange, New Jersey.
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade Mart?  This is incredible.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
You're not digging.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Why?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
What was so appealing about Houston?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I know.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
My sympathies.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Well... yeah.
Take a look across the street.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
And he never hit you before?
Was he there often?
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Uh huh.
But then you told her you were home.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Yes, Max, I understand.
Won't forget?
You were there for me.
You.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Hey, Jackie.
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
What's in it?
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
Can you do it or not?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
Who do you think I am?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
I am, as a matter of fact.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
He's got that kinda money?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Uh-huh.
Who is this?
'74, I think.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
We talked.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
You're not old. You look great.
It's not really something I think about.
Surprise.
"American President"
How was it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I don't care.
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Right around here, in the food court.
The day you got me out of jail?
More or less.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
What if he checks it?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Uh-huh.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
I didn't say you did.
We're partners.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Are you scared of me?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
If I don't cooperate?
Not every day?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Not really.
Who's the other one?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
What about you?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Gimme one anyway.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You already knew that?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
I was expecting you. Come in.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I knew it.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
If you want.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Plus the same deal as before.
I can do that.
Who?
What'd you care?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
What does she think she's gettin?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Where at?
How long?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
What's a Metrix?
The roller disco one.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
I don't like dancing.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Who's arm is that?
Sure.
Yeah.
Does that bother you?
All right already.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Who's your partner?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
I dunno.
Uh-huh.
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
What's your relationship?
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Uh-huh.
In the chest and stomach.
What?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Where you shot her.
That's right.
Pull the car over.
It's in there.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
What?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
They don't have your winning personality.
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have it with you?
Livingston, huh?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
What?
You didn't hear?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Winston found you.
And you did that to protect my interest?
And where's Jackie?
That I gotta see.
I know where it is.
Yes.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
He leave town?
He's around.
I'll give you his beeper.
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
No! Oh God.
It's fun.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Well, how do I look?
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
Well, try, huh.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
Hey, wait!
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Mom, it's ...
Now what?
Don't go.
A couple of weeks, I think.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I say you should get a shrink.
How do you know?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
A bit.
Sarah.
You should go back to her.
Wiggle your toes.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Jake, you need to rest.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I need your insight, your intuition.
Jacob Singer.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Who did?
I didn't want to wake you.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where are you?
Thanks.
What do you mean?
The room!
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Don't ask.
Where'd you leave 'em?
I don't know.
Jezzie, I can't see.
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
I don't let anybody call me that.
And look what I got.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Why you left.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Not to me.
Well, you didn't marry her.
What's wrong?
I enjoy crushing into you.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Where are we?
Where?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
Hey, I'm here.
It's gone to the top.
How high is that?
Get your clothes off.
Coming here?
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Here. I'll do it.
I know.
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
What's he talking about?
Jezzie?
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
What's gotten into you?
I promise.
Please.
I love you when you're angry.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
I'm not upset.
I'm tired.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Then don't bug me.
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where are they?
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Where have they gone?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Hot. Where do I sign?
You got a nice tan, though.
Total delirium.
Help me!
What is wrong with you?
What?!
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Nope.
I just need to talk.
I don't know.
You in trouble?
I don't know what to do.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Everywhere, like a plague.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
On top of him?
Oh, come on!
What do you mean, not enough time?
We don't have time to argue!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
What?
We made it?
What?!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
Cool.
Where'd you get the gun?
The hull's imploding!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
What are you gonna do, tell me?
Let's move out!
We could convert fission transistors.
Then stop talking and work faster!
I don't know!
And now we're all out of it.
Suit up.
You're a teacher.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
Yeah yeah. Got it.
What?
Where is he?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Negative.
Give me a break! What happened?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
I guessed.
What if we don't?
Not so bad.
Oh sure, all the time.
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
I think I had some when I was eight.
I think so, why?
I'm stuck!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
No shit. I got no problem with that.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
Close the fucking door!
GO, GO, GO!
Small brains make your balls itch?
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
You need to get laid!
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Ow!
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
No! He's coming with us!
I just know.
Keep trying!
Then open the doors!
Thirty seconds.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
See you then . . . doctor.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Are we locked down?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
What have I done?! Idiots.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Sure but what good will that do?
My boat's neat, dad!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Just a favor for your old man.
Here --  Take him home.
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
I almost had 'im.
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's taken him!
Probably out in the back yard.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
Feed the dogs.
I think they make you look sexy.
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
Where is he?
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
Thank you.
No. Home here.
Just sign it, Larry.
Our friend, the shark.
Florida license plate.
He ate a car?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I wish it would rain...
It's a whale out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
You picked her up on the ferry.
Think she might've run out on you?
Some friends and me took a house.
We never had any. What's the problem?
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What else could've done that?
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is anyone having this...?
Is that a boat?
Let me see your hands...
Fasten the pole.
What do you see?
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
And I'll drink to yours.
The shaft is giving.
No way! He can't!
He's under!
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
I'm pregnant.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
But you copy my work every week.
Or something.
Well, I do.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
I totally heard you did.
I still have your virginity!
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Oh, hey Vijay.
What is your job title, exactly?
Oh, go fly a kite.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Blood and guts.
I rock a Harmony.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Oh.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
No, he's the dad.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Uh, thanks.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Nope. We're safe.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I don't know.
What?
No?
Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Wow! It's magical.
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Yeah, like people in love.
Thundercats are go!
I am a suicide risk.
Is this Juno?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
You sound shocked or something.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Looks like it, yeah.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
Aren't you the cool guy?
I suppose anything's possible.
Carrie.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Took 'em all.
No it is not!
Hold still.
...Anything else?
What?
That's not true!
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
As many times as it takes.
Walter Livesy.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Vernon, Florida.
Best kind.
Henry Lucas.
...Then some.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Damn right I do.
What happened to Adele?
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
Up yours.
I heard that.
Fuck!
Take your time.
Look again!
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Nervous?
Where's Adele?
No, thanks, I can manage.
Shut your mouth.
...Janitor's job.
Who are you?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Yes. Altogether.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
You're clean.
Was up bitch?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Oh man, that's the best.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Probably.
Yeah.
You got any money?
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. Why you give money.
Fifteen for me.
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Yeah.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Yeah. Come on.
Hold on.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Here. Swallow.
Because your a virgin?
Of course I do.
What?
Come dance.
I guess so.
Were you protected?
I'm sorry.
You're OK?
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I gotta find him.
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
It's like...
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
Hello?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
It's grandmother style.
It's very monotonous.
Yes.
You are!  I don't like you.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
What?
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
The door was open.
No it wasn't.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
No, I need the original note.
You're a lying bastard!
Get off me!
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
It's a voice modulator.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
But a hundred men could move him.
Who is this?
Just a second.  Hello?
Did you know her?
You'll find her.
Not really.
Why her?
Because she's the type.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
The police haven't told you?
You sonofabitch!
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Very good.  How did you know?
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
Why did he what?
Come here.
I'm Kathy.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
Nice meeting you.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
For what?
Six, eight hours tops.
Any sign of rape?
No prints.
No Frank.  No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
It's important.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
I want to be the best I can.
Whatever's on your mind.
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
Exactly... and you did this.
Feel like practicing?
We'll call you back.
"Carefully".  "Carefully". "Carefully".
It seems like such a complicated game.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
Getting too hot in here for you?
She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead now.
It wasn't intentional.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Do you?
Let's change the subject.
Why?
You're not?
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Why?
I'm sure you are.
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
And you?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
Then show me who you are.
Call room service.
I tried again and got through.
Nothing.
Exactly.  It's the key.
Where's the note?
Why?
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
No he didn't.
He didn't tell you either.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
I got lucky.
We're almost married.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
About what?
I can't wait either.
Colwyn.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
All the passages are guarded.
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
All directions are the same here.
Of course it was.
I won't leave you here.
Does the Queen live?
Turold's son was to marry her.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I'm not sure.
But you suspect.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Where the spiral begins.
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
I can. Because I choose it.
You have done it?
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Even by you?
Yes.
I ache with it.
Let me comfort you.
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot.
Staying alive.
He saved our lives.
What else is left for a man without friends.
How did you know I had sons?
To the place where Death lives.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Not sleepy, either?
No.
A flicker of talent.
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Can't I come, too?
And mine goes with you.
No.
You can have half.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
You had better manners as a pig.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Food for crows.
Oh, my poor stomach.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
No. He will master the leader.
Then he will die!
That I am, my lady.
Yes. We lost five.
With an old voice?
You know the voice.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
She had another name once.
Fewer will survive them.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
But you would not stay with me.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had a son.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Why do you want to know?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Good.
130... 140...
You were scared, weren't you?
No, you can't go out.
Why?
Too heavy.
Mathilda, stop, please!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
I think.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
I have no fear.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh, that's good!
Ten dollars... A month.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Salute.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Here comes the resume.
I won't let you die.
I've seen it before.
You have?
There was no card.
What?
The new store?
We can do it together.
Anything?
Why do you polish it?
Then why?
There's no reason.
I will -- I promise.
You like to take walks?
You can't change your mind.
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
He's plastered.
Pacifica, California.
Yes.
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I see.
About my love for her.
Not our problem.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Making the grand total?
Perhaps there's another route?
Where?
California.
Walking where?
California.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
She never ate a slice.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
You're amazing.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
What, come on?
In a hospital.
I need your help.
Hello.
What?  Who are you?
This isn't right.
What are my choices?
Orange soda?
No.
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Water?
No -- S.E.R.A.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
I sometimes fade out.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Yes, that's right.
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
Thank you. What time is it?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
Sorry.
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Can we just ignore it?
No... we already talked about that.
Let's stay for a while.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I've been all right.
I am lonely, Yuri.
With an old friend.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It's me, Yuri.
Sera... please go.
That's right.
I can't tell you.
Go to hell.
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
What?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's not what's important.
He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
Who could better understand than me?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
His dead body with a bullet in it.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
No. I was in the shower.
Who's askin'?
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
About the alibi --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
Yes, I am.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Aristotle.
How about --
I don't know.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
I know. He has it sent out.
Yes, you are.
Thank you. I love you, too.
Josh proposed!
No way --
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
I wasn't gonna --
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
For a butt-head? Yes.
I'm quitting.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What do you think?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
What, like on va-kay?
I got bangs!
Really --
Why not?
Of course, I do!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
So are you!
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
Do anything exciting?
Thank you. Having fun?
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Thank you.
See?
Where?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Faith.
Purely a precaution...
What do you want with me?
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
Not from me, surely...
You... you're a beast!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
To be my bride, of course.
Yes?
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It's terrible.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
To be sure.
What!
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Something's coming.
Careful, lad.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Something the matter?
Ogg's footprints!
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
There's the way, mates.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
That's it!
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Sunlight.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
No, no, no... this is different!
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Three cheers for our champion.
They've fired the moat!
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
If you like.
Never.
I may have said perhaps...
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Be patient.
What's the matter?
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
Shhh!
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Jack!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
To fetch your napkin.
My own father...
Its powers are strong.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Then, perchance you'll me.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
Jack... Forgive me...
Only what's right...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
You've freed me, Jack...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
In the dark... where I join him...
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
As fair as me?
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
I don't believe you.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
Do I not please you, Jack?
And am I not fair?
Jest with me then.
How so?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
You... you... you mortal you!
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Up ahead!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
May God protect you.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
To Castle Couer de Noir?
In a dream.
I thought I might stop by.
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
Mom said I should.
Who are you?
Red.
Here, honey!
And why was the alarm on?
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I couldn't sleep last night.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Has he eaten anything at all?
He seems lonely.
Are you his friend?
Why?
What's that?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
What did you think it would be?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
He jumped into the ocean.
I can't even take a shower here.
No.  That's okay.
Turn over.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Does everything have to have a point?
I'm not gay.
I thought I was helping you.
Are you afraid of heights?
Not if what he left me was real.
Floating to Catalina.
What?
Will he talk to me?
It could have been a squirt gun.
You've been good this week.
I've been dreading you.
Oh, yes.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
He buys and sells the world.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe that's too long.
That's too long.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
She's out with a friend.
Oh...okay.
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You're here early today.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'll get your bag.
You don't have a choice.
I almost saw Catalina.
I warned you yesterday.
No you don't.
It bugs me.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
Hi, Mom.
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
What do you know about me?
I gave up on you.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Why wouldn't she leave?
That's so weird...
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
I'd build a house.
At least your father tried, George.
God, you look like crap, George.
I want you to find someone for me.
It's okay.
Where is he?
Where he always is.
He doesn't answer.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
Four days.  I left to think.
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Where will you live?
The garage.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
One of you would end up dead.
I want him with me.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
I'm married.
I drove over and you were gone.
I can't leave the house?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Well, for later then.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Oh...with his ear infection!
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
I think so.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
I can hire workers to help me.
You've never said that before.
I can't pick you up.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
I need to know.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Left you?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
What?
So could I.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Not a perfect day.
No.
Nothing.
You got the money?
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
I could use the money.
A man he respects.
I'll make you something.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
You can't go because of Sam?
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
That's the problem.
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
Take it off.
Either do you.
It's not ours.  It's George's.
I didn't go in your room.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Dad said it first.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
In the bedroom.
Nigger.
That's my girl.
Better make it a week.
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
Not for me, it ain't.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
But I'm having a good time...
That's because I've never been here before.
I know it begins with a "C"...
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't think so.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
Nothing.
That's right, a loan officer.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
What'd you say?
Yeah, I want some pie.
Still got that ten dollars?
What ain't there?
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
I'm sure it don't.
Claude.
I said you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Let me take a look at that map.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Whatever.
Let me see that.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That's the way it is.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Don't touch that car.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
I said you're soft.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Why the hell not?
Gimme that damn thing.
They're touching.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm all right.
You ever done time before?
I try to moisturize regularly.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
How about some steak sauce?
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Move it out.
Movin' it out, boss.
What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Rayford!
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Satchmo.
Me? Willie Long.
That's a long story...
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
Please, get out of my mind!
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
I'm calling you out, brother...
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
Angels don't get any older, son.
She's so nice.
Oh. Sorry.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Put it in your mouth.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
How bad?
Son, just do your best.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Beast.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Yeah. You do it.
The Dark Prince is here.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
Peppermint... alright.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
So I followed him...
You followed him?
All right...
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Andrew.
Really?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Good. I was concerned.
What was that?
Are you dead?
No.
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
East Rutherford.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
I love you.
I love you.
I don't know.
If it's Cassius, yes.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
You're a beautiful pair.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
It'll be all right...
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Well... you can't have them all.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Of course.
Anybody we know?
At Carousel tonight?
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I'm Mary 2.
I'm very smart.
When do you go up?
Please... No.
You prefer women?
No.
Well then...?
He was killed.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
Curious.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
I'm listening.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Why is it wrong to run?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
Six. I go red next year.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Then it's still no.
I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
How can I?
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
Maybe you'll think of something...
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
You're not going, are you?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I have.
But what is this -- why?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
We'll be all right...  We will...
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
Then the answer's yes...
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Beloved wife...
Are you sure?
At least it's over...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
I have always been here...
Are there any other humans?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
All right.
And all alive you say?
Yes...
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Good... You up for a drive?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
Pile in.
What?
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
Ours, Ed.
What's that, Ed?
Yeah, I remember.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
It's me...
Hi.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
I used to.
What's he do?
Yeah.
How'd it happen, Alice?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice, I...
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
What's up?
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
Did you tell the police this?
No.
Yes.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
We'll get a tail put on him.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
He didn't come home.
No... I don't. Why?
Who was the man?
I don't know yet.
Not even close.
I... I didn't say anything...
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
My... My head.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's absurd.
Alice who?
What are you going to do?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
A videotape.
Who's it from?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
I wish I knew.
What?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
But...
He's got some fucked up friends.
No... of course not.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
All right!
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
You're my man, Pete.
Who is this?
You know who it is.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
No. No, I don't.
Yeah?...
Yeah.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Sure. Sure I do.
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Come on... get in.
Yeah.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Oh, read it!
Yes.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
A paleontologist.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I beg your pardon.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Look here—
Yes.
Please don't call me Lovey.
Yes.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Why, you look beautiful.
Over by that hill.
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
How do you do?
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
Who, for instance?
You're startled?
Shall we have another?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Then it's done.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
What is it, my son?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Dead?
See that spot?
Yes.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
That's what you said.
Well - I mean—
Chang! Chang! Chang!
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
What's she got to do with it?
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What about the others?
was saying—
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
hope you'll forgive me for—
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
A man whose life was empty!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Please don't go.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Hesitated, sir.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
The hell were you thinking?
It's not even a fucking door.
What the hell...
I guess I lost:
You got smeared.
No. just peace on Earth.
I gotta be honest about something.
What happens if I say no?
You do?
Yup.  Sure is.
What?  Who the hell are you?
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Right.
Ha ha.  No, really.
It was a long time ago.-
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Gee.  You really think?
And what's this ... ?
What?
I think that's what's happening...
We're rising.
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Right.  Oh, and here.
In case I need it.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Do have any idea what I just said?
What the hell does that mean?
Actually... I don't know.
They respond to fear, right?
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Did he say where?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Fine.  Good.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
They went right to the President.
Actually, I don't know...
Oh shit!
Can you see?
What?
Is it now?
Who?
Forget that guy --
He'll turn around.
He won't.
Wait.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
Someplace safe.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
She grew up.
She's still alive?
Then who was he?
Just some guy... they found.
Somewhere.
Because I found out about her...
Anne Lively...
We know each other?
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
You set your patients on fire!
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
... Graveyard shift.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
The nation votes this week...
Tuck in your shirt.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
In the middle of the night?
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
I'm not getting halo'd.
You can't run --
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
No maglev system.
Georgetown.
Now look at him...
Sir?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
But you call this room the "temple".
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
She's a precog?
That's right.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
Then take her to Radio Shack.
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
That's great.
All right, I'll try...
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
What the hell.
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Hold your breath, Dad...
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Tell me!
You're not gonna kill me...
Good-bye, Crow.
I'm a little dizzy...
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I believe in that system...
Do you?  Really?
Hold that thought.
Why should I trust you?
The safest place of all.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
He also said Crow was a fake.
I'll be right there.
My God...
Wait, just a second...
Not quite.
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
Who?
Sure.  Raincheck.
I know who you are.
Yes.
He's not here now, is he?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
That was our apartment.
You mean after he lost your son.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
What does he want with a precog?
Yeah.
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
When served warm --
I can take you down there.
Yeah. Take it.
Thank you very much, sir.
What, sir?
All the suites are about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
See you later.
So you're models?
He's okay.
Should I fuck him?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
We used to take baths together.
Come on. Let's go.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
He's not doing it.
Chloe?
Uncle Bobby?
Mommy's not home?
No.
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Go.
With what?
How could you let her see this?
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
But what about them?
I don't get it.
Well, you look it. You win?
You driving her?
Yeah.
Get away from her.
Brooklyn.
Yeah?
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Ricky's taken care of.
How so?
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
A million. Easy.
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Then what are you saying?
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You told him you liked him.
What is it?
You want --
Take a few days --
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Bobby.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
Well, this is the corner.
Yeah.
Depends what night.
Understand me?
Yeah.
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Ruiz isn't here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
Thanks.
What about it?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
It's not losing record.
How am I being shitty?
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. I know the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Then why do you try to get in?
Shhh...
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
He didn't say we need guns.
I'll beat your ass --
Sorry coach.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
I don't know.
Is that the woman from..?
She really liked the kitchen.
I'll get the girl.
Nah, don't bother --
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Great. On my fucking room.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
What are you doing?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
Well, I don't want to walk.
I told you what they said.
Nothing.
So they said more than the address.
What the fuck do you...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
You got something to say --
Yeah. What vibe?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
You would think.
So we're working?
About what?
You fucking nuts?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
She was jonesing for me.
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
C'mon, man...
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
The penguin house.
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We don't need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go now and wait.
Three and a half hours?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
Right, right. The 'thugs.'
Fuck...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
How is it you're good? You on a list?
You see a Ricky Slade?
What?
S'up.
How much is what?
The videos.
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
'Strapped?'
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Watch it...
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
Does anyone want another?
You want another drink?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Here...
Come, now. You just got here.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Soho Grand, right?
Yeah.
You'll love it.
You know my pager number?
No. What is it?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
You rode?
Yes. You're going to New York.
And where do we bring it?
What?
Tell me.
So tell me how it is.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
We're square.
Yes, sir.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
What?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Bet you like that shit.
Keeps me out of the army.
How 'bout that?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
I like you, country.
Lemme write it down for you.
Why?
Just now.
Solid, daddy.
Nnnnnnn!
I'll take your goddam bet.
What you talking?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
The bitch was there.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
I'll give you back the 600.
I don't want your money.
There's two guns on you.
Now.
That really you, Red?
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
What did you give it to me for then?
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Don't con me.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
I don't know how.
No, Brother Minister.
She ate.
There's nothing to talk about.
Just an idle question.
What have you set your mind to?
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I love you.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
You're with me even when you're away.
How do you know?
The talk is everywhere!
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Down front as always.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Then we don't know that God was white.
Yes, sir, I did.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
"His greatest greatness."
Say what you're saying.
And like a fool I believe it.
The sentences to run concurrently.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Did you hear me?!
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
Let me die then.
And don't come back.
You hear me, girl?
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Well, all reet, then.
Shorty, this is Laura.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Head nigger in charge?
I'm the man.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Eddie, let's see that blotter.
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Where?
[Si.]
[Daniel what?]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[The what?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[Her life for your life.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Show me, please.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Have you used this type before?
It's loaded.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Nothing wrong.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
I came to visit you.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
If they like me.
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Why not?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Not at all?
No.
But why not?
I'm not crying.
I go to school, don't I?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
Where?
Everywhere!
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
You need to practice.
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Don't worry. You will.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear.
Your father has business.
Could I stop you?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
So are you.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
It's Creasy.
Where are you?
What was her name?
Do you know what she told me last night?
I'm trying, mom.
You do?
Don't forget your towel.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
I think it's fantastic.
Hmm?
Creasy.
It's not.
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
You helped him get this job.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
What?
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.
I'll call her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
You want me to ride down with you?
It's early.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I came to see you. How you feel?
That's nice.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Marty.
Your son Marty?
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Please...
No...
Please...
Marty...
We just live one flight up.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Goodnight.
No, I'm not kidding.
Where you going now?
I'll see you.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
You gotta good heart.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
So I'll die without a son.
Put on your blue suit...
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
What didn't you like about her?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Hello, Thomas.
That's all right, that's all right...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
He's parted his moorings.
How you, Radar?
Where?
Hospital.
Which hospital?
Look at that right eye.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Duke Forrest.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Be right with you.
We could steal one of the choppers.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
I can't... couldn't.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Oh, Jesus.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
It's possible
Hang in there.
Same here.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Duke...
You really say the cutest things.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Glad to help.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
Just in dreams?
You guys got any black capsules?
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
That. It's out of the act.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Sir?
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Morning, Captain.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Arterial silk.
Yeah, I'm all right.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
You got me.
Hello.
Uh-huh.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's the one.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters!
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
The letter.
What letter?
John Doe.
What John Doe?
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
What bonus?
Oh.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
Look!
Both of 'em?
Naw.
The heelots!
Who?
It must be some kind of a gag.
A gag. A gag!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
John Doe Club?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
I want it as soon as possible.
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Did you write it—or didn't you?
No, I didn't write it, but—
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Good night, John.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
SWAT wants to go in.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Deal.
Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
I'll take half of your action.
You don't want to know.
Is that where you're family lives?
You're gettin' the car.
Automatic.
You got it.
Is there a problem?
I what?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
What's the suspect's name?
For now that's all.
Spread it out.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
I've rarely shot anyone.
Try to remember that.
National Marksman Competition.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
It was okay.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Well, if I have to, I have to.
Why? You like my ass?
You living together?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
So what do I say to this guy?
Get good at it.
It's against my nature.
Why?
To save lives.
I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Still needs work.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
We lost.
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
Pull up alongside.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Only that floor.
Is the hostage injured?
You worship yourself.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Maybe you should be.
You heard.
Can I come in?
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
I've proved that, didn't I?
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
As a matter of fact, I do.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
And it's hard to get.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Just now.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Do it!
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Hmm?
I've been thinking.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
What?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
The car is part of the deal.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Roper...
Who's running it!
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Yeah, they are but...
Come on!
Yes, I believe he has --
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Okay...
To live forever.
-- If your life's so good up there Gena, what are you doing down here?
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Yes.
From the dream.
Then what?
So wrong --
Yes.
In here I am.
It's not real.
Not real?
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
But what if he doesn't --
We're going to have to reconfigure.
At least a day.
The weather.
Who?
There is no --
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
What?
The truth.
He wouldn't say.
Not his style.
Why would I do that?
To hide the evidence.
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Where?
Times Square.
Insurance?
Some things never change, do they?
What are you talking about?
Night City.
Once they digitized you, they added it.
For what?
You weren't real.
I know.
Not you.  A copy.
What's the difference?
Sorry?!
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
This.  No point to it.
Just like that --
Activated.
Program name?
Describe program function.
-- Standard.
Scanning body type.
Resurrection.
Access established.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
They're called squirbs.
What does that mean?!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
We can take these guys!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
LET'S FLY!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
A real shame.
BULK!!
Look closer.
... A falcon?
Did I say anything?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Quack like a'duck!
Activating Power Scope!
What's going on?!
LET'S DO IT!?
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
But I've never served a day.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Tell me about it.
But not you.
Not another word.
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
No. Not everything.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
If we have to.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
That ain't what your mama said.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I can just imagine.
For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.
No. I'm here with you.
I must be going.
For what?
Something came up.
You're sure?
You got something to hide?
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Gives us something in common.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
But there's...
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Tommy Reina.
Come off it, Bugs.
Ben-jamin.
They don't give a shit about us!
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Didn't know you felt that way.
And I got it all planned.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
We learn from life.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
We were overdue to get hit.
And what do you want out of this?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Fuck 'em.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Now that's a hard number.
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
This is nice. I mean it.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I didn't say anything.
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<i></i> In what way?
Ohhh, nothing.
Got a doctor on duty.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Are you okay??
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
I don't <u>know</u>.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
What?
Isn't that Lulu?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
And you don't deal drugs?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
You don't like where I live?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Dating anyone?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mother!
But I was dusting.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
He's an organic farmer.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
You mean it's dangerous?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But it *isn't*?
It couldn't be.
Blow a bugle!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
What! Who?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
You play--left field.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
"There's more light here," he says--
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Diz--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Tonight?
I'll cherish ya.
No.
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Right now--everything I own--!
Take me home, Diz.
He's a house-afire!
Sam Foley--dead!
Great saints!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
All right, why?
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Jeff for Senator.
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Certainly. Step right in.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
I beg your pardon?
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
What? Who?
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
Mr. President!
For a question!
Here--where are you running off to?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Ah, now, that's better.
For a *question*.
No, Jeff--please--!
Jefferson--
Yes, Ma?
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
We'd better see.
Office of--Senator Smith?
J-Jefferson Smith.
The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Punch?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
A *day*!
Tonight.
Committee.
Why?
Good. Where are we?
Some committee's got it.
What?
The Steering Committee.
And a *lot* of paper!
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Since sixteen or so.
I also answer to whistles.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
No!
No! Stop it!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh--*Saunders*!
Saunders--
Hurray!
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Then you *did* say it.
No--I mean--yes--that is--
That's--that's splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
That's dynamite, Joe!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
What do you mean?
He's lost complete faith in me--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
You won't stand for it?
You can't say *that* to--
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Do I actually *see* this--?
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Yes.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Sometimes twice.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
And sings.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
Next, please.
No.
Why not?
Are they true!
NO!!
Yes, but I—
That's all, Miss Bennett.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
What's that got to do with it?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Yeah, let's.
That depends on what they see.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
He did? I play the tuba—
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
I'll get my hat.
All right.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Oh, hello darling.
People have been crucified before.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Running away is no solution.
Uh-huh.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Last night he proposed to me.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Hurry up!
Boy, was he burning.
Come on - let's go!
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Me, sir?
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes.
Perfect! Perfect!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Let me go!
This is outrageous!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar!
You can't?
What?
That tuba player!
Yes.
How do you do.
Why, no.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
No, thank you.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
Naturally.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Yes?
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
I don't know.
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Prairie? Oysters?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
You try it.
Yeah.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
No!  What do you want!!
Hmm?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Not any more.
I think he's got a point.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Stop now.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Go to hell.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
Should I open it now?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
But you did come to me.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Yeah.
My patient had to leave early.
It was Henry Follett.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
You're on your own today, honey.
...so accomplished.
Lily.
Doc.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Sure I can, Lionel.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
Got to.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
We're going for a walk.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Oh... not a real doctor.
That's right, the fake kind.
What do you mean?
I think you do.
Why don't you tell me?
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
No.
Sorry... I'm done.
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Is that like a party trick?
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
It's all right.
Which thing?
Either one.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Transference!
Transference.
Hello.
Which show was that?
You're not the only one...
But...
What is your name?
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Will you be here?
In maybe three or four issues.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
It's a big part of the show.
What do you want me to see?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
How are you?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
She's probably ten years older than you.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
This --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
You don't think I'm insane?
Definitely.
Just you.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I can tell you anything else.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Everybody has a story, Skip.
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
But look at me now...
Things got a lot worse.
You and Candy...?
How'd you do it?  The new you.
All new people start with that...
Psych major?
English Lit.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Wow.
Yes, yes it does...
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
And then killing your sister.
In the desert? What for?
Then what the hell are you doing here!?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Do you know where I can steal some?
What friend? You're my only friend.
Oh yes, always.
Yeah! Them.
What is he doing here?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
To be hanged.
I am an English woman.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Proceed!
Three hundred pounds!
I would never!
Twenty.
What are you doing here?
No?
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
You swear?
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
I found sand. I saw death.
If you call that a kiss.
I know my treasure.
Are you sure?
The things that get you excited.
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
For entering the afterlife.
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
I'm not?
Why would I do that?
Because that's my name.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
FINE.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
You lied to me!
Way to go, Evy.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Yes,... I see.
Um, well, you see...
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
You have got to be joking?
I knew you'd know.
I know you knew I'd know.
And what's that?
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Your mind is so slippery.
Head hunting.
One last tweak.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
The Disco Boys.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
I was eight.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
I'm the Bowler.
The Inscrutable Six?
Let's do it.
I thought you'd never ask.
I dunno.
Sure.
Doctor Heller?
It's me... Elizabeth.
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Think positive.
What about Captain Amazing?
Why bother?
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Are you with me... or against me?
So are you!
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Just a waitress.
You underestimate yourself.
Terrific.
Just wanted to... powder my nose.
Me.
Remember the cat.
What?
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
Every night.
Yeah.
That was easy. 
Why?
Yeah.
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
Monica, where are you?
What are you talking about?
Bye. 
Monica!
Good or evil, what's the difference?
And you are a fool.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
So when are we gonna have an on night?
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Because that's what it is.
Are you coming or not?
Not a chance!
With what?
Why not?
Who's chicken? 
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
See ya tomorrow.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Wait!... Look!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
The Eradicators!
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Not yet.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Ow.
Oh hi, Mom.
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
It is?
Definitely.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
The Disco Boys.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Be a Mohican. 
Shut up.
The who?
Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still alive?
But how do we get in?
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
Right.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
I'm glad you like it.
I did, sir.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Cavalry?
There are none here.
Where are they?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Ajaccio.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Why are you carrying the dog?
When you eat him, may I have some?
Why didn't you wake me then?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Would you like some brandy?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
Junot?
When is she supposed to return?
May I offer you a drink?
Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
Were they pretty?
Yes.
Were any of them married?
I cannot promise you that.
You are my old friend.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Goodbye.
Yes.
It's me.
Why did you give it to him?
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
I wrote it.
What?
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
How do you know?
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Yes, he has.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
Show him in.
Let me have it.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Why you say that?
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Suga!
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
Don't move me.
I'm his cousin.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
I'll do it.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I can't taste nothing.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
That's the sister.
You walked?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
I don't know yet.
I didn't see nothing.
How you know?  It could be anything.
You go first.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Wait for what?
What about me?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Better sooner than later.
Well bring yo' ass on...
What it smell like?
Just hold your breath.
It's alright.
I saw it.
Smokin' what?
Peace out, Craig.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
I don't have no damn cover.
Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
Go for it.
I don't know.
Bite his ear!
Thanks for the help.
I got fired too.
Sorry, my ass.
I don't know.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I don't know, Debo.
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
What?
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Nothing.  What you want?
'Take your car?'
Yeah, and hurry up.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
I got my mase.
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
I threw my back, again.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Who, him? Just visiting.
What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
That's my girl.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
What?
Business or pleasure?
Business.
San Diego.
What?
Yes?
My security people are right next door.
You were very nervous.
No.
Who did?
Same to you.
I'd like to know what...
What's your point?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Then I have time for a drink.
Tell me why he's dead.
You fucked up.
I kill her - and you kill me.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No, please...
That's right. That gives you...
Let me talk to her again.
Forget about it.
No, that's,..that's fine
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know you do, honey.
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
Don't think I won't.
I don't know.
Thanks for the tip.
I don't think so.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Fuck you!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
You're a big girl, huh?
Why?
Help me get her off the rug.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
What about them?
Right there.
You're wasting time.
Do it!
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Just put her on.
No.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
Dad, you're bleeding...
You understand?
Not even her?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
And I won't never tell about the money.
How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Don't!
She went.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
All to pieces!
Twenty-five wives!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
What?
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Get along with you.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Ah.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
There! What's so hard about that!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
John! Don't!
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
John, where are we g --
Dead. 
Up river.
I mind you said there was two.
I'll make coffee.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's taking you so long about it?
Don't you believe me?
Why sure, boy, sure.
You could save him, little bird.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
All right.
Where's the money hid.
Why, pray tell?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Pearl and John.
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
I was praying.
Harry, what --
Get up.
I'm through, Harry.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
How'do.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
I been out with men.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Thank God.
Haven't slept, have you?
Not really.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Hi.
The killer.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Okay. Hi, dad.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Just want to talk to him a second.
I don't mean her --
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Right home after. See you.
Get into bed.
I will.
Great
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Put that damned thing down!
Nancy!
Proof he's declawed. As for him, we buried him good and deep.
Just sleep now, Mom.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
You were screaming like crazy.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
He's nuts about you.
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Bring me forty-five back.
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
An omelet.
And you too, Ninotchka.
About what?
You should. I'll show you.
What was it like?
Evening gown?
What do you wear in the morning?
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Positively not!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
What is it?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Yes, Comrade?
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
The former Duchess!
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Eight forty-two, sir.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade.
Comrade Kopalski...
Two thousand francs.
A week?
A day.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Look for yourselves.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Right away... instantly!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
No, thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
Don't hold that against me... please!
What business?
Private.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Me?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
At what intervals does he whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
You might hold this for me.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
I'll try.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Yes, very strange.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
That is correct.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I was wounded before Warsaw.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
It's twelve o'clock.
No, that was restful. Again.
Oh, let it ring.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
This is a place for workmen.
Must one always be after something?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
At what?
Then you should go back to your table.
I have never heard one.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
And General Savitzky.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Thursday.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech.
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No. Nobody will find us.
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Yes... a kiss... salute!
All right.
Radio! What is radio?
No, no music.
Good morning, Swana.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Am I interrupting?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
She's gone, Leon.
Hello.
What?
I must ask you to leave.
In that case I can only say good-by.
What do you want?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
That depends on the tip.
Please... sit down.
Thank you.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
At Père Mathieu's.
Where is that?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
What?
Uh huh ...
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Is it?
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
Why me?
You think this is just about politics?
I figured that out.
He wants money.
Pay him.
I thought the gloves were off.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
... go on.
There's no secrets here, Al.
Cox!  Fire him.
Can we get around this, Al?
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
How do you see this?
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
You never told him?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
We could leverage Helms.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
No ...
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
Thou must.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
I never met the man.
The White House.
You're fucking me.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Her name's Sandy ...
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
Did you cry when he died?
Why?
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
That was a long time ago.
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
Where you from?
Hello ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
Fire him.
I know ...
It's hard to lose ...
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
Not that.  Us.
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
I'll never run again.  I promise.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
You don't have to go.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
I don't want them to love me.
Do you really want this, Dick?
And then you'll be happy?
Then I'll be there for you.
Are you okay?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Then what are you scared of, honey?
You personally?
When?
Tomorrow.
And what am I doing?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Lost.
Someday, Dick.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Who else'd be in your truck.
How's that?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
How come're you doin that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Nineteen zero and nine.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
You're discouraged.
I'm... discouraged.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Well what would you call him.
Oh yes.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
Not word one.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
No.
You sure?
That's the boy.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
No. Probably I don't.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Gun out and up.
I'm hidin' behind you.
That from the lock?
So when was he here?
I don't know. Oh.
Sheriff?
I'm ahead of you there.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
Well. If you say so.
I can't plan your day.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I put it in, Mama.
No. But I gave my word.
To your husband.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
It's full a money.
That'll be the day.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
Hey.
You know what's goin' on?
I can hear it in your voice.
She'll be all right?
I know where the money is.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
What's that.
I mean the nature of you.
Did you go up to his trailer?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
You expect him?
Not a bleep.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I don't know.
You know who it is.
I don't need to talk to you.
Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes.
Nobody. Accounting.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Sixty-nine cent.
This. And the gas.
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yessir.
Now. We close now.
You live in that house behind the store?
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Just call it.
How's that?
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh.
Somethin' like that.
The kind with the most poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
You on all night?
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
Yes?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
The option.
That's got two double beds.
What else then?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
It's called a transponder.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
No. You don't understand.
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Yes.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Were you in Nam?
So was I.
To kill your wife.
No I don't have it.
No. You don't.
Are you jackin' with me?
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
What outfit.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
Tell him what you told me.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Any idea where it is?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Oh. How come?
You must be joking.
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
The LeSabre!
Maroon.  I stole it.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I gotta go make dinner.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Well, you are.
No, Del.
Yes, she is.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
I ran back in to get the phone.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Uh-huh.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Roy! What are you doing here?
You're in serious danger!
Los Angeles, California.
No. Loma Vista.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Worse.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
He has no heartbeat!
You're hurting him!!
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
I was talking about what you could wear!
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
No, that should be more than --
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
...and put them in your mouth.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
You told me how to do it!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
Should I kill him now?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
...among others.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
What?
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
I'm not telling.
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Betty was a lovely child.
Oh, five years, give or take.
It is, if you like idiots...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
No! Let me try this!
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Uh-huh.
Oh fuck...
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
She's a lesbian.
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
"A Reason to Love."
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Fire! I hate fire!
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Four hundred, Delmar.
Izzat right?
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Not that I'm aware.
He was never turned into a frog!
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Helluva awgazation.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's not my ring.
Not your...
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well, we need that ring.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
That wasn't my doing...
Well sure, honey, but...
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
You didn't know that at the time!
Million point two.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I am. Hur you?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
Yes, Sir.
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Nobody. It just came to me.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Well, goodbye.
How're you doing, Sarge?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Louder!
Yes, sir!!
He was. He died.
Yeah.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
But in what ways?
I haven't made up my mind.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
My kinda group!
He didn't give you much choice.
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
It sure was.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
No, they're for your mom.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
Sure.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Not with me.  Not with people.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
I have the gun.
Remember that.
Please...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You got an idea?
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
She better.
That's their problem.
Not that one.
NOT THAT ONE?!
I know.
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
You're an idiot.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
I did.
Shit!
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
I mean it!
Adios.
Everything okay?
Huh?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
No, you can't come in.
I said open the door.
It's okay, Raoul.
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Observe.
What?
Why?
The furniture guy?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
0150.
Don't.
Fuck her too.
People.  In the house.
That room!
What?!
PANIC ROOM!
What do they want?
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Nope.
Chills?
Huh uh.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Fuck.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Give me a break.
Little bit.  Yeah.
Don't though. 
What am I, a five year old?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
I'm here.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
I saw something, I saw...
On it!
Uh uh.
He WILL.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Not an option.
What if I do?
Fuck that, we've got company...
What are doing with yours?.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
What's with you?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
No Fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
No man. PE -- "political education."
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Alone...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
Why didn't you tell me?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
You don't look alright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Good.
Late summer.
Thank you.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
It's a start.
That would be nice.
Pride will do.
You got me beat on both accounts.
As do you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Yes, sir.
Who cared for your wounds?
As you wish.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
I consider them linked.
Sir?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Not yet.  What happened?
It's safer if we stay together.
He tried.  It didn't take.
You know how old I am.
God help us all when you're forty.
I didn't see any.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
She is.  Don't go in there.
And what do they know?
Thirteen years...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
You said bribery twice...
Gabriel.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I am, I think.
What are my orders?
Goodbye, Harry.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Four, five miles.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
For what?
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
That bad?
Worse.
When?
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Ayuh.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Yaay!
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Because you promised.
I know.
I'm sure you're not.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Not at all.
What?
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
I don't know.
You'll see before long. Let's go.
You keep saying that.
This time I mean it.
Don't worry about that.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Well...a touch of the flu...
This babe has said enough.
Nope. He's your cat now.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Remember.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
I'm sure.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Wait as long as you like.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
That so?
Aye, for us there is.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Would that I could.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
That would hardly be proper.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
-- then we never would have met.
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Me!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To the Black Pearl.
Nor did you, I noticed.
She can hold a bit longer.
I know.  That was for the smell.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
Smith.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Pirate.
No.
Move!
Because you're a pirate.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
On what?
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
No.
He's not telling the truth.
He may be.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Where did he come from?
A moment.
But --
Please.
You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
No, thank you.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
You're not rotting meat.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Then you still love me?
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Poppy, this is not the time!
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
The trunk.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Yeah, I do!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Well, you got another problem.
You're looking for a urine sample.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Who isn't?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Like Crazy Glue?
So, I guess it worked.
Really?  What have you been doing?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
The big house.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
That's what I thought.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
No, something is really wrong... look!
Mouse?  What mouse?
I don't know.
Three days ago it was.
What do these replicators do to people?
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Yeah.  Old times.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
It's still inside me?
Something else I want to try.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
Argon's private lab.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
I have to!
God, what a fight that was.
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
It's a miracle.
We lost him.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Yes - isn't it.
Goodbye, Stew—
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Certainly. Right over there.
You're all right.
No - give you another guess.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
Now let's get this settled—
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
Good morning. What does this mean?
Oh, hello Mother!
Mother!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Oh, man!
Well, I should say!
Yale '21, I believe.
Huh?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I'm afraid.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Come on, get going, get going!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
That's so.
My play.
Sure.
Araby, my eye—!
No?
No!
Your valet, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
—and those and them.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Must be my wife.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
To Old Madrid.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Conrad.
Yeah?
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't.
Double strength!
I have. Double-strength!
Get out of here.
All right, Grandma—
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yeah.
Found no skeletons?
No, sir.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.
No. I want to know.
Ah.
Okay.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Sure.
I had to say goodbye.
Thanks ... I love you.
I love you too.
Hello Bill.
I'm sorry ...
I think it looks nice.
Here's my favorite.
She's crying.
No she's not.
It's alright.
I don't know.
But I really should get home.
But you can't go out there.
No I'm not.
I don't want it to go away.
I'm gonna go now.
Oh yeah.
Lover's Lane!
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Trust me ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
So.
Why not?
With what?
It's better, Mary Sue.
What's the matter?
But it could happen.
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
Real rain?
Yes I did.
The basketball team?
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
Why am I out of order?
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
Oh sure it is.
No it isn't.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
No way.
YOU get lost!
What happened?
I don't know.
What's going to happen?
Neither do I.
We're supposed to be in school.
Owns the hardware store.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
As a matter of fact he does.
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
Jen please ...
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
It's fine.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
Oh ... Hi.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
Out there.
Rain.
Real rain?
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
I'm not sure.
I like it too.
Marmalade.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Nice ... Nice ...
McGinty's.
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
What?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
NOW!
Oh no? Let me show you something!
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Christmastime.
Hi.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Open it.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Hey.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Cool.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
And what was this?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
D&D Mattress Man.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
So it's ok if I bring her.
...please, I just don't want it....
I'm trying to be your friend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Did I say that?
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Why?
It's fine, but --
I feel really on the spot now.
Are you gonna do it?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
I have no idea.
Call me later.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hi, is this Jack?
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
I'm in my bedroom.
Are your pants off?
Where is she?
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
You're going to work now?
Yeah.
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
No. I'm sorry.
I need help.
-- you said you did.
I didn't lie.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
It was cool last night.
I have to go.
They don't get opened until eight.
Do you know them.
Not very well.
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Yeah.
Alright?
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
No I didn't say that.
Nothing.
Did something happen; are you alright?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
I don't know.
This is Lena.
Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I don't freak out.
Thank you.
Lena?
Yeah?
It's Barry.
I just wanted to make sure.
It's so nice.
Yeah.
This is nice.
For work.....
That's right you travel so much.
I'm fine are you ok?
Yes I'm sorry.
Let's go to the hospital.
You can't do that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Ok, bye, bye.
Bye.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
How?
On my knife.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
I know.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
And your name?
What's that for?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
I'll say whatever I want --
Thank you.
Hi Walter.
How's business?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
Ok. You're connected.
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
Why you wearin' a suit?
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Hi, Lance.
Let's just leave it there for now.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Hi.
What do you have in the house?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
Ok.
Seriously.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
I won't.
When can you leave?
As soon as you want.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
That's it.
What's the problem?
Put him through.
Yeah.
Just tell him to call me.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Now give the signal.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Yes, Abbe?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
What? What've I done?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
You always do.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
THEN BUGGER ME!
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
NEVER!
I'm here.
It's a formality; truly.
His wife's?
Well...?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
No. It most certainly was not.
How is the patient faring?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delbenè?
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
There's something else I want from you.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
No. But tell him I would.
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
-- words alone are insufficient.
....shame on you, truly...
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
But it's just begun --
Do as I say.
Very much.
Am I?
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Sure you can, just--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
But I am That's the killer, honey.
My name is Orson Welles
And director.
Randolph!
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Bel Air is restricted.
There's no call for that language-
It's not really--
How much?
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You will not walk out on me
You are repellant when you drink.
The drinking.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
No -- no -- I mean--
I wanna see the picture today
Uh-huh
You are talking to him.
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Showing life
But with compassion and insight--
The great Spanish bullfighter
The old man has his own way of doing things
Sorry to disappoint.
Fuck you--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
She was . . . innocent
It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION!
But it's not a great syllable
I don't care.
I don't give a shit about-
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
George...
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
That's for me to decide.
You're going to destroy it
Get out
Pardon?
Ah, it's a grand title.
They've all seen a rough cut
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
I don't want to sit
It was the best, kid
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Yeah.
Yes!
He's Christ?
I'm Christ
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
None of your fuckin' business.
Nothing...
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Here's your glove.
Go ahead.
Whadda you care?
With her? How?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Say what you're gonna say.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Where you been?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
So what?
Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Yeah. At night.
Three more, I figure.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Can you see it?
That's all right. He don't mind.
It's OK.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Now take your panties off.
Oh, Jake.
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah, what?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I called. You weren't there.
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
What?
Then what?
I don't know.
Why don't you just call him?
Sure, what else is new?
No. Open the door.
All right, just don't make any noise.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Oh. When are they expected home?
He has it. Thank you.
But his leg!
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
All right -- you don't believe me.
What time?
Six ayem.
Not yet.
Who left -- where?
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For what?
Who said I was getting rid of it?
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Next time, have some good news.
Gunnison?
Something wrong?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
How?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
I don't want to.
That's abnormal.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
And some man will lose his.
He and his wife splitting up?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
Huh?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
What?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
No.
Now wait a minute --
Smart? She'll be arrested!
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Mrs. Doyle?
Yes.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And your stomach?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
Uh-huh.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Make the one you want.
For what?
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
I mean what I said.
I have one now.
So do I.
Tell me about it.
Something too frightful to utter.
What is it you're looking for?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
125 West Ninth Street.
To get on home.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Too close.
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
Two minutes.
A new disease.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
What?
What?
Chicken?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Stay there.
Hi.
Okay.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
Down in back.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You still want to go home, Moose?
You can't protect me.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
Yes.
What would you do, Dad?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You don't want me to go.
Sure.  Sure.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
I was talking to Jim.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Are you going down there?
Look--just relax, will you?
Open it.
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
Well maybe she better start.
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
He has a knife.
They're still there!
What?
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Who's that!
It's me!
They're looking for you!--
Help me in!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
No.  I'm scared.
We'll take it!
Come on!
I'm what?  What?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
When was that?
What do you think?
Come on!
Just a guard.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
All right, darling.
Goodbye, dear.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Why should you be the only one.
Just tell a little white lie?
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
Wash up and go home.
No.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What?
If he could--
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Bully for you.
See?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Goodbye!  See you!
I'm not so bad.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm numb.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I felt like it.
See, we're very modern.
Should we explore?
Hi.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
No!  I got to find him.
What's he like?
Hi.
He hates me.
Do you think your father means that?
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Hi.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Don't hurt him...
No, baby. He wants me.
Searching for a money man...
That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
Radio said negative five.
Yeah.
No, hey, I like your coat --
What.
Smile.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Yes it was all you --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Beauty and fragrances.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
You sold him out.
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
You're not hearing me here --
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
I love you!
Canada.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They're truck drivers.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Don't say my name...
I love you, Nick...
What?
We'll need one.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Keep 'em there for a little while.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
You shouldn't have.
I'm glad it was me.
What are you talking about?
You said it a million times!
I never told you my name.
The hell I can't.
I shared his cell!
But you were saying you were...
She says a lot of things.
What?
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
No. It's her brother.
Five million?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
And I worked there. For a year.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
I'm gonna need some money.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
'Tis the season, convict.
How'd you know my name...
Where is he?! Where is he?!
He's not Nick Mason...
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
Not with you.
How do we do that?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
It's a roach, guy --
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Not yet.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Good for you. Protein.
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
Ash... Ashley...
Tell her... I'll be there ...
YOU TELL HER!
...be with her...
NICK!!!
That was my king!
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
You're hitting for MY cards!
What? No...
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
They changed the layout.
Now where were we?
Fine, now.
I'll call somebody.
Who?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
How do you know all this?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Yeah.
Me and Mr. White?
A little.
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Take a seat.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Dead as Dillinger.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
You gonna put it away?
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
He don't tip.
You do?
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I do.  How do I look?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Down to my car.
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Correct.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
You don't believe in tipping?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
I got the diamonds.
Where? Are they out in the car?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
So what is it?
I think he's just passed out.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
If we don't, he'll die.
We don't think this place is safe.
What are you gonna do about him?
Yeah, those guys too.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
As far as -- Sonora?
Just about.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Go on, there's a good boy.
His letters will keep.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
We can't stay here!
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
That's fine.
It's too light yet.
You don't mean that Clay.
What?
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
How's that?
A little hot.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
And meet him there.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Swimming.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I don't care what she asked you.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
I just wondered. Let's go.
Kind of sore.
You'll live.
I can't take her with me.
What's there to be fair about?
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
I'm sorry. Let's go.
That's a good girl.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
Yes, people make me restless.
They went on like I told you.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
There's still tomorrow morning.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Who brought you here?
Where is he?
Up the trail.
I don't know -- I don't know.
Yeah, we sure have.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Lookin' around.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Good night, Steve.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
No. We're not stayin' --
That's the end of the line.
Then I know my alphabet.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
What do they look like?
How about California?
I was doin' both. Here.
Oh, sure.
Let me do that.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Ha! Right bitch!
Alex, what are you doing?
Do I know you?
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey, I have an idea...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Hello Ray.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
You sure?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Okay.
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Open chest!!!
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Let's get outta here.
Shit!
No. Try a little higher.
No. Keep rubbing.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?
I think so.
So, whatever happened to her?
Oh, right.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
Just wait, you'll see.
We have to destroy him.
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
No, my friends are right here!
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
You could use the grade, huh?
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Don't touch me!!
Let me see the files.
Are these all the subjects?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
Just a little experiment.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Of course. So sexy.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Alright, go to the belt store...
How is she?
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
My holy water.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Dog, you look hot.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
What happened?
0h, shit!
You don't think...
She wouldn't...
No more violence... No more violence...
Jeeezzz!
You said you hated him.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Thanks, Mom.
But, Chip...
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
You bring me such peace...
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
COCKSUCKER! 
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
I didn't do it!
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
So you admit you just lied?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Marvin A. Pickles.
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Right here!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
There is one big problem though.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
Now, here's a babe!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
How to send a bill!!
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
Yes.
I'd like to get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
No.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
She can only use cash.
How much have you got?
About forty-five dollars.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Hello, Frances.
What is it?
I did her hair.
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Goodnight, Mary.
That you love Mary.
I don't know.
You will die.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I have something even better.
But you're always at the library.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
It's here, too.
What a peculiar question.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Tell me what?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I don't know.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
Thank you, my dear.
That's too bad.
I'll be out in a minute.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I should have known. She had no sincerity —- no real belief.
Yes?
Graham Dalton.
False alarm.
Yes.
No. Why?
No, I think you look... fine.
Nine years?
Sister older or younger?
Who's Elizabeth?
Lawyers.
No.
Kids? What about them?
Do you want them?
Impotent.
You are?
You're in therapy?
Aren't you?
You had sex with you therapist?
Videotapes.
What kind of personal project?
Donna?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Why not?
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
Like what?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
Yes, I do.
You know?
She said it on her tape.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you want to make one?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You are married, correct?
When we're making love?
Sometimes. Afterward.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Yes.
On tape?
No.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I'm babbling.
No, you're not.
But if you were?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Why not?
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
I don't know. Possibly.
Why not?
Mmmmm...
I ate by myself.
I'm not either!!
Why don't I believe you?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
He does.
Not very often.
Yes.
Did you masturbate?
God, no.
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with that?
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
Why not?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Then why'd you call me?
I don't know.
What kinds of questions?
Questions about sex.
Cynthia!
What!?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
No, but I did.
You touched him?
You are in trouble.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Then why do you keep asking about it?
What is it?
It's a sun dress.
It does not.
Well. I can't stay.
Bye.
It was busy.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
The extrovert.
Talking.
About what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
I just want to ask you questions.
That's all.
Do you like the way I look?
Prettier than Ann?
Different.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Hi.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
In here!!
Cynthia. John.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Cynthia. John.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
How about straightening up the living room?
Graham.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
Not for three-fifty.
You were prying before?
She held up very well.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
My keys?
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
One moment.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
All right, jesus.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
You knew these people?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Uh, OK. Sure.
Well? Supper at my place?
OK. But late.
Down to the incinerator.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Just breathe normally.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
That's the one.
That you, Rog?
Lemme clarify for you.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
A wreck.
What's cookin', Bert?
Nothing.  Just...memories!
You got it!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Who trusts experts?
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Everything's free there.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
You too, Betty!
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
That doesn't make sense.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
I know.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
I NEED SOME
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
F for...
Flavors!
F for...
Fabulous!
F for...
Fast!
F for...

Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
CRIMINAL
SIN-I-FUL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
She walks in beauty...
We love you, Baby.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
You guys having fun?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
I love you.
Bye.
Yeah, I'm here.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Bottle.
You got it.
I'm good.
Is it chicken?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Good. How're you?
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Maybe. Recognize this?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
And?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
That's a good age.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I owe her a call anyway.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Want some?
Just a minute!
We should have driven.
It does. Feels right.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Fuck you.
Beautiful.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
What?
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
I will.  See ya!
Right now.
What're you drinking?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
That was three years ago after that first party!
Can you give me some room here?
Huh.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
What's happening?
You have to tell me --
I SAID OKAY?
What?
It's private.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Yeah.
What?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Please, Miles, please.
The plan is... you go.
Hrnrnrn?
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I'll pay for it.
You need a new car anyway.
Whatever. Sorry.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Back at you.
You were wearing your belt.
Maya, how are you?
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Good for you.
Twelve months in oak.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I know. I love that.
That's what I'm having.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
What was the bottle that did it?
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Okay. See you around.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Okay.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Yeah.
Victoria.
Miles?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Ken.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So how're you doing?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
French or American?
Good stuff.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
You golf?
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
A hair.
This one?
Dad!
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
I'm here.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
I'm not going to curse.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
I heard.
Yes, it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
I got him.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Ray Reddy's house.
We have to go in the basement.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
I'm looking!
Got it!
From what?
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
Graham.
Don't.
It needs batteries.
Edgar, come inside.
Don't do it.
Dad.
They win.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
What about them?
There are none.
What was the first thing?
Okay.  So he was tall?
I would say so.
No.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yeah.
You'll lose the signal!
They think it might happen all at once.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
That's why they got you in jail?
The one with the shotgun.
There's nobody coming?
McKendrick.
Did it seem short to you?
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Sure.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
Have to.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
Is he alive?
Right.
They've been kind to me.
Paden sends his best.
I just came out to say goodbye.
It's one thing to know it...
My name is Emmett.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
Going to Turley, was it?
It's a town...
They got a saloon there?
Women?
I expect.
Which way do you mean?
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
I've got a job.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
The other guy drew first.
We didn't get that far.
He'll be here.
He is now.
Who is he?
All I did was kiss the girl.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
You can't do this.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
I don't have any family any more.
Why come to me?
Why would they stop you?
Because they enjoy it.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Where's the dog?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
So we understand each other?
I thought we talked about that.
Paden.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
Here he comes right now.
That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
He left me.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Good-bye.
Why isn't she with you?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
I'll send you her resume.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
Everyone you know is lying.
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
She doesn't want pity.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
I can imagine.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
It was a great show, Dad...
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, call me Simone.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
For her?
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Somebody said she was here.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I've seen them all before.
Not like this --
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Hello, sweetheart.
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Hello, Lainey.
This week anyhow.
Is she here tonight?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
-- I know, I don't know anything.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
She thinks you're with Simone.
I love you too, daddy.
She did... didn't she?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Yes, very.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
I will when you're finished writing it.
What do you want -- ?
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
Yes, I'd like that.
But that's Simone's part.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
... digitized.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
You know what I'm talking about.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
I didn't leave you.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't step in the horse manure.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You hate him?
That I'm a freak.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Words.
Upset words.
What?
Yes.
Your eyes told me.
Never mind.
I don't know, Cole.
When?
Soon. One week.
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
What happened?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Oh.
Lots of things.
Anything bad about me?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
So who moved it?
I'm ready to communicate with you now.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Oh my God.
Standing next to my window.
They scare me too sometimes.
Dead people.
Dead people?
Ghosts.
...I don't know.
You think I'm a freak?
Stop it!
Stop looking at me.
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
Stuttering--
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Let's say today, we make it your business.
You're standing in horseshit.
What's a "little while?"
Two.. maybe three days.
See?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
I happen to be a professional.
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Not lately.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Sorry.
Book of Jeremiah.
Hey. Fuck you.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
I thought you said two hundred.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Manure... is life.
"-- an AXE!"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Harvest moonshining!
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
People say he was a murderer.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Not while you're driving.
What's wrong?
The audience!
Who you callin' "boy?"
He's right. You were behind.
Chicken sandwich?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Name something.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Nah. Just you.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
No. Not without you --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Like your guitar break.
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
Just checking out the lights.
Hey, Grant.
It's my nature.
And this is mine.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Yeah.
Hell, I was game!
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Shut up.
You're pretty.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Grant, you're sick!
Through a wound on his stomach?
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You paying for the gas?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
A what?
Eyes on the road.
Is this fun?
Driving?
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
We lost him.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Ciao.
He's after us again!
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Ummm?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
Well, thanks for the lift.
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Kate.
I'm begging.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
That's me.
No.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
See.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Yeah?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Redneck heaven.
They're jammed!
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Yeah, guy?
What's your twenty?
I'm at marker eight-five.
I hate to say it...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit?
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
I'm here.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
About one to five years worth.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
How's your twenty?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Chickenshit money.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Of course. Yes.
Mortal.
No.
Yeah.
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
And threw us into the lake.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
...About what?
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Without peer?
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
They what? What? No. No. Why?
-- no, we need to handle it now.
-- You can and you will.
...He does now...
I wouldn't go that far.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
A million flat.
No shit.
None whatsoever.
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
How are we on time...?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
It's gettin' done Sid.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Like a mafucka.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
You'll end up like me.
You're not Gibarian...
Didn't you talk to Snow?
I want to hear your version.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
That's fantastic.
Not her.  It.
No, she won't.
Whose side are you on?
How?
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Why, who did you see?
Dead?
Told you what?
To who?
What is it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Human beings can die.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
I won't be making the trip.
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
To calm my anxiety.
And tonight?
Better.
You go home.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
It's something.
As I said, then it's God, right?
You don't know?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
I'm glad.
You don't love me.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
You... she said I didn't love her.
No.  I love you.
I love you, too.
Not this time.
If you're here.
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
No.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I never said I didn't.
You're lying.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
But then I would be dead now.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Why do you say that?
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
I'm not Snow.
Hello, Win.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
There's a phone in the car.
Queens... You know Queens?
No, Ma'am.
Not too sure about that.
Let's get a drink.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Yeah.
Listen, that was my fault.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Hmm...
Yeah, what a woman.
How did you know?
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
Yeah.  It was.
And "is"...?
But "nice".
Very nice.
Tell it like it is.
I'll miss you, Mike...
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
Sleep good.
Open the door, will you?
I can't open it.
Stop being nuts!
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Not exactly.
Are you okay?
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
Let's do it.
I know.
... Don't explain.
"For"...?
Mike...?
So.
I don't know...
You don't have to, now.
You take care.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Nothing.
I'm all right.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Your what...?
What are you talking about?
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
What shit, honey?
I'd identify him.
It's not your taste.
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Why?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?!!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
You heard me.
I watched TV.
What did you watch?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
I'm all right.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
Ever shot anyone?
Yes.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll prove it!
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
What the fuck you doin'?!
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's what?
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Be nice.
Let me see.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I'm always here, Pete.
See?
They'll never take me alive.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
I know.  I've got one too.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
I got you a present.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
That's not even close.
Get away from me, freak!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
Fine.
A spider.  Eight legs.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Even if they're not clever.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's too early to be clever.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
You should write that one down.
Does it have a human name?
Hurry up, Flash!
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
I think I'd like that.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I'm here...
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Peter-- my condolences.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
That's the understatement of the year.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
See?  You big dullard.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I left a paper in my desk.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Hi, Professor.  What's up?
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
How much do you know about it?
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Just drop me off here.
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
No, no!  Not there!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Static!
Roger.
Okay. Move on.
We'll get some more.
A little something what?
Thanks.
I'll call the whole pot.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
What some brandy?
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
What is your number?
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Jawohl.
It's a mouse trap.
And this?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Let me go!
Betty Grable!
Me? What if she don't want me?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
No?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
She'll never forgive me!
Bombs away!
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
It's not good for you, Animal.
You hold him. I'll slug him.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine, too.
You're crying, Animal.
You want to go?
No. I want to draw.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Yes, sir.
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Says me.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Anybody cover?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You off your rocker?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
What did you say?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
What time?
Give me the radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
What guy?
How many do you want? A thousand?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
HoS qorDu. 
Where is he?
Full disruptors.
Can you project its course?
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
We better get you back to the ship  La Forge to Enterprise.
One minute to warp core breach.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
All of us.
Where is he now?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
I don't understand.
Please, I insist.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Yes, yes, it is.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
Close to retirement?
I hadn't planned on it.
And what would that be, sir?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
I thought you might.
Aye.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Make it so.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
No, sir.
Thank you, Number One.
No. Thank you.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
The thought had crossed my mind.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
What is it?
David... Sorry I'm late.
I went wrong.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
My readings indicate great instability.
David --
Spock's burial robe.
Logic indicates that is the case.
I have already made one transmission too many...
Why?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
. He will remain always as he is.
Much is at stake...
Yes. And I know you.
The ship... Out of danger...?
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Red alert, Mr. Scott.
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Come on!
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Welcome home, Jim.
Indisposed, sir.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
But, why?
Because you wish it.  
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Understood, my lord.
Station!
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They know we would die first.
Wait!... Wait...
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
How is that...?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I'm not a drama critic.
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Ah.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Jim please --
Mother, go back!
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
I saw it -- !
There's an air-lock.
What's the matter -- ?
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Are you running away from me?
Is that what you came here to say?
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
Oh, I believe it.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
They're still running with shields down.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Inoperative.
Raise the shields...
I shall avenge you --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Try the emergency channels...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Scotty, let's have it.
Admiral --
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The word is given: warp speed.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
Yes.
The power of creation --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It would explain a great many things --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
Or the one.
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Who?
HURRY.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
All stop, sir.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Distance from Reliant...
Dismiss the company.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Stop engines.
Trying, sir!
Battle stations.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Aft thrusters, sir.
Ready, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
He's very human.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
I do this because I was there,
... They do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks...
Fine. Just fine.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
That's crazy!
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Come on, Pavel...
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name?
You play games with me and you're through
I am? May I go now?
I'm wery sorry, but --
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, aye.
Sir, heat shields at maximum!
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Understood. What is your plan?
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
We are launching everything we have.
The hell they did.
I was not.
You've already been that. C'mon.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What's what?
I'm all ears.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
A spaceship with a missing man.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
In progress, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Thank you, Spock.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
They did, Admiral.
Steady as she goes...
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
... Aye sir...?
What is our condition?
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Right on. You fly?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
There are days.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
For someone so young.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
I am better.
I don't.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Really.
No... I want to stay with you...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
No.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Safer than leaving her here.
Captain, Geordi...?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
I believe it is safe, sir.
It is over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Do you have everything you need from command?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Eject the core.
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Can you beam him off?
Say the greeting again...
Wine, women and song.
Or you could try lying down.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh?
Activating injector assembly.
All ship functions are off-line.
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
At least four hours.
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
No.
I believe so.
Do it.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Where's the Sphere?
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
How serious is the damage?
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Active.
Main bus...
Ready.
Yes.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
You're lying.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Some.
I have to...
No. It's a lot further than that.
Why?
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Destroy the deflector dish.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Just a little queasy...
Emergency override!
Nothing.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
What are you suggesting?
Riker here.
Commander... we have a problem.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
The charge is murder.
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
That's the question -
I wish I knew. Uhura?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
More than ever.
No way.  You see this?
Spock's looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
We were until your torpedoes!
Then let me help!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
Retire.
That's a comfort...
I'm not sure how to take that.
You feign ignorance?
WHAT HAPPENED?
How can I trust --
And what did they tell you?
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Yes.
For insubordination.
I know what you mean...
Uhura, monitor!
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up, Captain --?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
They'll be here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
And your coat.
There's a reward for your death.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
It IS possible.
Captain, if --
WHO ELSE...?
I always wanted to try that.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Uhura, signal our surrender.
You hear that?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
LET THEM DIE.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
Spock, I'm really tired...
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Spock, you want to know something?
Not yet... Section 4236...
WE SURRENDER.
Who else?
An omission. After that -
I don't want to.
I believe you. Please...
Confirmed, Captain!
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
Yes, please continue.
I know.
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Indefinitely.
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
To new worlds...
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Aye, sir... This way.
It would appear so.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Fire!
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
Sir.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Why is it moving?
The resemblance is... striking.
Thank you.
With pleasure, Captain.
Of course, sit down.
And I you.
I know how he thinks.
This isn't about me anymore.
Understood.
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Deanna, on my mark.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.
Number One.  You have the bridge.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
On screen.
On screen.
Your new chair, sir.
Counselor?
Away team. Transporter room four.
We can only hope so.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
I have dissolved the Senate.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
No race should be a slave to another.
I have no reason to.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
In time.
Why am I here?
I was lonely...
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Not so long.
But you want to.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
It is... invigorating.
Runs in the family.
Should I raise shields?
Let's go.
Yes, Praetor.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
No -- this is wasting time.
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
You heard me.
And?
I don't want to scare them away.
Have a nice trip.
How much are your rooms?
I'll take that.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
I make maps.
Make any money?
No.
He's got a gun!!
Stay right there...
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
About five miles back.
They must have picked it up in space.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
Shermin...
I just retired.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
This is George Fox...
Watch it. They're coming out.
What.
Ah no.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
Police...
Good.
That way.
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Pancakes.
Pancakes.
X...
Money.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Smile.
Smile... good?
Yes.
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
No gas.
Yes. Very good.
You'll see.
Closed.
I know.
My... husband.
I am husband?
Shit?
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
Yes.
Candy.
I...
I want to try it.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
Horses.
Music.
You didn't even see it.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
How will I do this one?...
Yes.
No... The closest...
Why?
But I speak English.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Yes?
Please stay.
What?
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Yes.
It's bad.
He will.
Are you my friend?
Why?
I don't know.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
You liked my singing?
Yes. Sing some more.
You can have one.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
I can't stay on this planet.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
You're damn right I am.
I do not get cold.
Nothing.
Horses.
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I want to gamble.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where?
I must go.
Goodbye.
Call the police!!
Hey buddy... let her go...
I don't know where he is.
What? No, of course not.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
No, sir. Radar.
It could have been anything.
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Judy, that's stupid.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
We can't let you do that.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
A star is born.
You're going down.
Maybe later.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Make me forget it, baby.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
No.  Mace is in this.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
But this is a bad one.
Is he dead?
No.  Bad idea.
Jesus!
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What else you got?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Strickland.
Commissioner Strickland.
Your existence.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Define illegal.
Fumitsu.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
She still loves me.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Wants to share.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Jesus, Mace!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
There's a plus side?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Uh unh.
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Yeah.  We did.
Yeah.  See you there.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Take the tape to the cops.
You really want that on your head?
Um... he was older.
Besides that.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Anybody talk to the press?
The diner?
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Who knows.
You tell me.
What?
She's buried.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Not bad, huh?
What's wrong with me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Smarter than us.
Another what?
What are you doing?
Speck. Harold Speck.
MyDick.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
I don't believe this.
I'm hesitant to...
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I was visiting an old college friend.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Five months. I love it.
Not especially.
That information's being withheld from the media.
It explains a lot.
Don't even go there. What's up?
You want to have dinner?
What's this country coming to?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
I know.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
Sue Ann Hanson.
You mean --
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
I just need to go a little slow.
You were right. He found me.
What's going on?
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Kulok.
Sit back.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
So you're the new meat?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
The same.
I talked to him.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Take your shirt off.
You've been through worse.
You're right. I know.
I don't know about that.
No. Stop, come on.
Shut up.
I'm sorry?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yeah.
What's that like?
Nikki.
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Why? You're not a real man?
You too?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
How?
What what? What advantages?
Anything.
...and even then...
...you might get cut out.
What else is going on?
My pleasure.
You haven't told then, huh?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
I'm a comedian.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
It's a rebound.
I understand.
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
Yeah. And an actor.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...It's really getting late.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...get the hell outta here already...
Lorraine?
No, no. Hold on.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
Why didn't you call?
Well that sucks.
It sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
I'll give you an eight. 
What'd you get?
An eight.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
There's the rub.
...yeah, a month ago.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
No. Just O.J.
I'm such an asshole.
She wasn't your type anyway.
What's dumb about it?
Well, you're doing so well...
Make someone bleed.
Damned if I know...
Wow, I guess you were home... 
S'up Trent?
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
What?
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Vegas!
Vegas.
Whu?
She smiled baby.
That's not cool.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
You think they're watching?
What?!?
You gotta do it.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Who's the big winner?
What an asshole.
She smiled, baby.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I don't think so.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Yes!
I'm telling you!
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I don't think so.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That was different.
How?
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
...through the kitchen...
It's on.
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
That doesn't matter.
We're not messing with you...
No...
Oh. He's got it under control...
Chelios to Roenick...!
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...How novel.
Now?
No.
What was cold about it?
You think?
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
...it is so on.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
You don't have to wait three days...
I'll be back with the coffee.
Good.  He never doubted you.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Shut up.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
BA FA GOULE YOU!
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
OK, but be careful.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Sure.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
This morning.
Barzini.
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Good.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Shhhhh.
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Come here a minute, Fredo.
That's for you to find out.
Give them some money and send them home.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Can you do it Mike?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Mike, why am I out?
They're waiting to see my father.
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
How is your father?
I love you.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Can you say it?
Please say it.
When will I see you again?
Wake me up when you come to bed?
Tell me!
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
To the city.
Send some bodyguards.
Cut it out.
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
I do wish to be baptized.
I can arrange security.
You're unlucky.
I think so.  Detective squad?
You just woke up!
Shut up!
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
I'll come down.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Oh, it was.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Say again?
You know, a primer.
That's funny.
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Your parents met her.
Sure. I love Venice.
I have to go to Venice.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
What are you talking about?
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
So cool.
How?
Marge-maintenance.
Aye, aye.
Dickie?
Who is it?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Good. Now you can go for a reason.
Yes it is.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
My fiancée.
Sure.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
I think you're right.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie?
Tom.
To the manner born.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I can explain.
It's all true.
Golly. Who's paying for this?
Excuse me?
Emily.  Just kidding.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
Where have you been since then?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Hmm. C'e questa... 
I can't later.
And tomorrow?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
He says so many fiancées.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
I'll fix some drinks.
I'm fine.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
...Tom is a mystery...
Yes?
Of course. What happened to your face?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
What about Ripley?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
31 people.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
You have, yes.
That's an expensive gun.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Yes, mam.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Thank you, Travis.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
It keeps ya busy.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
What do you mean?
I mean porno movies.
My God!
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
I'm getting a taxi.
Keep it.
Can I call you?
Hello, Betsy.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
Yeah.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
This is gotta be a game, right?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
No, I'm serious, really...
The kind with a brush.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
Well... I guess so.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
Easy.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Do they drug you?
Oh, come off it, man.
But that one night?
That's not hard to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Pittsburgh.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
You're not much with girls, are you?
I sure hate to go alone...
Got your license?
Yes.
There's porno theatres for that.
I know. I tried that.
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Education?
Military record?
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Why do you ask?
Sure.
Anything you say, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
O.K., cowboy.
I'm here to see Iris.
Things got ya down?
Real down.
I know.
You want to talk about it?
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Tell me what you really do.
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Wrong.
What, vou?
It's about time.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Partners.
You knew?  All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Hi.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
I am, too.
That always used to work.
Dad... 
It's possible.
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
I do?
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
Why me?
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Whoa.
Nothing.  
I'm  fine.  Really.  
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Well, son, you're home!
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
... Ernie.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
Yes?
Yes.
Ha!
... what?
Did you... did you...
Did I what?
A few.
Vultures...
Zackly.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Then I'll call you a cab.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Call me... Ishmael?
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Thirty a month.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
Why not?
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
Why not?
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Nineteen-oh-nine.
I can play the piano?
No, I...
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Thanks.
They will.  They w-w-will.
It's about me.
Oh.
That you got let go.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Got any money?
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Yes?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Yes?
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
I suspected as much.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I don't understand.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Look.
Just listen to them!
Take them.
Yes?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Shhh. Shhhhh.
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Morning.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
I see. How do I get down there?
What name?
Daniels.
Okay.
The little Brenner girl?
I need her exact name, you see.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Young woman cut herself.
Shall I call the doctor?
They're back!
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
Maybe we ought to leave.
Shhh. Shhh.
Oh, my God, look at her!
I mean. I want to...
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
If they are?
You don't have to.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
I don't mind, really.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Did you close the door?
And locked it.
Please.
We know what it is, Al.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
That's all right.
Lovebirds, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Ahhh, but I know you.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
Only violators and practical jokers.
Yes?
We... we went to school together. College.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Seven o'clock then.
Maybe.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
You were lying.
What did it say?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
But not for me.
What do you want ?
Cheers.
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I have several jobs.
What do you do?
Yes.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
...everything I know.
We've got to get Cathy.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
How about you?
Mitch...
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
To...  To kill them.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
They are incapable of organized warfare!
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
I haven't finished my drink.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
But can't you give me any idea?
I want you to help my little girl.
Of course I will.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I'm cold as ice.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Gray killed her.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
Well --
I wanted to see the white horse --
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Why don't you do it then?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
But what makes a thought start?
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
I know --
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Any attacks of pain since?
Three years.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
Where are they?
Dream on.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
Yeah. I sure will.
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
Who are you?
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
The scar.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I was talking about you.
How do you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
You killed that cop Dutton.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
No! Why are you haunting me?
I don't want to see!
Have to find him first.
It's not. I can't take it.
Shut up.
You know.
Could say that.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
I mean Lauren.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Not tonight. Honest.
I want you... to bend over.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Just hold on to me.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Watch out!
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
You killed her!
No.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Please. Come inside.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
All right.
No foolin'? Will you?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
I'll say goodnight again.
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Looks real to me.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
What time is it?
Yes -- Just exactly.
Remember those words.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
Can't stand light?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
Fine!  Stay here!
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
You gotta drive!
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
Zero.
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Two down and two to go.
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The baddest!
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Why?  They're only noodles.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
For a ride.
With him?
Yeah.
I will, David!
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Hit the lights again.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
What?
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
You have a T.V.?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I thought we were goin' into town.
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
No.  Just you.
I like Michael.
For what.
For everything.
He's just a deep sleeper.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom... please.
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
Not that poor.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Must be a circuit breaker.
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Hi, Thorn.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Well, I...
Okay.  Talk.
Star.
What do you mean?
I'm Michael.
No... no, everything's different now...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Because I love you...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Huh?
Save Laddie first.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
Even poor people have T.V.s
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.  On the phone.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
The Marines.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Yeah.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
I don't know who to trust.
What?
Now who'd go and do...
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Was dark... find a light...
Clark, you come on out here!!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Well, go on.
Probably the next meal.
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
We got morphine, don't we.
What?
Garry's missing!
You been made, MacReady.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
Then we'll never make it.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
All in Norwegian.
Bennings?
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Well, get to it.
A day or so ago... I guess.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
After all this mess.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
What's that?
You reach anybody yet?
No.
What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
We going to make it?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
He's dead.
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
The generator!
Screw the generator!!
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
What for?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
MacReady, that you?
Well, let's get down there.
Hear what?
I had an accident.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Around here.
But there's nothing here.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Do you know where they live?
How have you survived so long?
Excuse me?
Send him away.
What?
It frightens you.
Yes...
This is the way in?
Yes.
This way.
The air... the power.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Alexander.
We make them see what we wish.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Because...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I -- what are you?!
You know I can't.
Trust me...
All right, what is it now?
I mean... well... affection.
You're getting warmer.
Hold on... I know I have it...
You know I can't.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
Darling.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
I've seen it.
Let them.
God, and I'm running late --
Nothing.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Then why are you here?
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
Good night, Alex.
His home.
Thank you.
He's gone to a better place.
What makes you say that?
More than 800,000 years.
Why not?
You can see so many here.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
All of you?
We share everything.
Thank you.
I don't understand.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Orion's belt...
Yes.
If you only knew...
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Mara...?
No!
Do you have it?!
Hello, Mr. Philby.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Yes, sir, he --
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
That'll be all.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
I took a different route.
My father has gone to a better place.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
We don't know.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
We choose to believe it.
We are what we are.
What's it like where you come from?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
They're inside --
I'm fine.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
Should we be...
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
It's not my job to believe you.
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
Yes.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
You may have known my father, William Starks.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Good.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Just do it.
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
They're not.
[Beat, lost] No.
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
Then, where are you going?
Good. How's your mom?
Ok, I guess.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I'm doing fine.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
No. I don't want it to.
I never knew my father. Did you?
[Beat] I don't know.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
The future doesn't look different?
Because I don't have time.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
Yeah.
You have nothing to fear, William.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Don't you go to jail for that?
Where are you going?
Sure.
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
No. [Beat] Not around here.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] Why?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
What.
Hon?
What?!
What?
Go fuck yourself.
Yes, baby?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Aw, God.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
My Lord.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
I'm spinning.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
You're a bank robber?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
A regular outlaw.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Christ, sure... yes!
Not yet.
Call me back.
What?
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Who is it?
It's me.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Front.
I'll call you right back.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Get the car.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you actin' like this?
You're not touchin' that car.
I think better when I drive.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
She thinks he's a pig.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
What happened?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Litterbug.
Yeah.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Why not?!
Just past Boise City.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Gosh.  It sure is.
We should have just ignored him.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Harlan.
Shoot the radio!
Sorry!
Hit it.
Yeah, you want it?
Are you alright?
Yes, Thelma?
We can live in a hacienda.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
We've gone insane.
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How long do you think that'll take?
What?!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You too, sweetie, the best.
What?!
Way up ahead!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
It's grand!
All this for us?
Then let's not get caught.
What are you talkin' about?
You, too, sweetie, the best.
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
We're fine!  How are you?
Fresno.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
I guess.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
I don't know.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What?
Well think about it.
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I don't know what to say.
Mints?
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Big time.
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Dumbshit.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
I already know it, Mary.
How'd you know that?
Are you... an architect?
I work with retards.
I beg your pardon?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Well, I'll see ya.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Huh... that's strange.
Warren!
Well, I know you're busy...
You don't buy what?
You can't be serious.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Nope. Never been.
Huh?
Three different guys?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Surprised?
Answer the question, shitball.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
You bet.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Nice.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What?
Oh. Well I am.
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
He's no Steve Young.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Puffy, get over here.
Where would I have seen your work?
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Hi, Mary.
Are you all right?
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
Oh... are you... ?
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
Thanks.
Hm?
Twenty-two.
Trying to be.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
Go!
Okay.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really?
Really.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
You got what stuck?
I think a little of both.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I mean is it... is it...?
Teddy, be brave.
Oh God.
So what's up?
Eh.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Tomorrow...
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
Something your father would've come up with.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Cuba.
Time is of the essence.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Dean Rusk!
Not as far as the election goes.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
Damn right I'm scared.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't get too attached.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
Who are you?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Tell him, Ray.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Check him out, Ray.
-- a fucking cop.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Good.
How'd you know?
Cooch. You're my hero.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Watch out!
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Why should I tell you.
Because he was talking to me.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Cuz you're a cop.
What are you talking about?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Nothin'. Forget it.
What?
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
That's right. Turn around.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Go ahead, Ray.
Never mind.
I read, Cooch.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Mister Tully.
No. No, no. Thank you.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
How the hell do you know?
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
How so?
And on to a bigger one with you?
It would have been really embarrassing!
How did you know this was my car?
I saw one.
You saw a MiG 21?
Where were you?
On his six.
Two miles.
Two meters.
You know. The finger.
What would?
It is combat. Every second counts.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Uh hum.
What if he's not?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
I'm different.
Anything.
You're an animal.
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're horrible
About as much as they think about killing me.
Where?
You always get what you want?
I don't know yet.
In that order?
Well no...inverse order.
You ever fly an F-14? 
. Yeah!
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where'd you get it.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
I'm fine.
This is it, then.
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
I want it back.
Yesterday.
Hardly ever.
I sit. I think. I play games.
I like to play "reality".
How does it go?
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
And that's one!
Who's gonna win?
I was, later.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
Well what?
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
YEAH, COUGAR?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
He better be kidding!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
What?  What is it?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
No! Now we're inverted!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Saving them some paperwork.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
I can recover. Hold on!
280, 290, 300 knots.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Any more MiGs?
Got you here.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
Mister to you.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Time to go.
I can't eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
They should have warned you about that one.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
What now?
He won again.
SHIT!!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
Figured out what?
Who is the best.
Need a hint?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
But you continued to fight.
So have I.
What the hell you doing?
Helping him in.
Didn't everybody?
Bad?
How's it goin', Coog?
The wings..
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Oh, you mean the thrill!
All right.
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
I called your house.
My wife's house.
I don't know...
He was by the book, all the way.
Not something they tell dependents.
It's not true.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Over there man.
You got the job.
What was that?  An accident?
The Last Resort.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
I'd advise you to hurry.
Identification?
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
But I thought...
It's about goddamn time.
What is it?
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Nice to meet you.
Eight years.
Hetero.
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Sleazy...and demure.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
At Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Not since you lost him.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Where?
There!  The woman!
Arrest that woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Where's Kuato?
On his way.
You tell me.
I don't know.
C'mon!
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah.
Well don't.
Harry!
Let me buy you a drink.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Level 2.  Galleria.
What is it?
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
The door opened.  You got it.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Quit while you're ahead.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Mmmm.....
Nobody.
I don't know.
Tell me!
You know I do.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
Move to Mars.
All right, forget about it.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
--I got a trip to Mars.
They did!  But I killed them!
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
It was implanted by the Agency.
And falling in love?
It's time you found out.
I'm here at Rekall.
Nice to meet you.
Right.  Mars.
That a problem?
Let me go!
I love you.
What are you talking about?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Not any more.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
I'm not falling for it.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Jump!
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
You two-faced-bastard.
The reactor.
What reactor?!
Aliens built it.
Aliens?!
It's just up ahead.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
What?
...Who are you?
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
You're really leaving, huh?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Has a lot of rain.
Do not talk to the driver.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
Adios, bridge!
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
You're hung up again.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
A man who plans ahead.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Sons of bitches!
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Little sons of bitches.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
I'm gonna help you.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Only if something happens to me.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Not yet, not yet...
No ties.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
God, what a stink!
Okay, ten dollars.
You okay?
Let's assume that it is.
LET'S DO IT!
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Let go of my hair.
Where's the nearest hospital?
Bellevue. Straight up First --
So noted.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
Oh really?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Damn right I'm right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
What other case?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
What, the lunatic who --
"Cecil Stipe." Find it.
Roger Baron.
-- What?
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
...What do you mean?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Let's get a cab.
What's Art Esparza?
I followed her from the courthouse.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
You don't drink "booze".
You do.
I don't need sleep!
That's right.
Figures.
Exactly what happened then?
I killed the motherfucker.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
Afraid of what?
What went down?
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
"No," what?
It's okay, Eddie.
By trusting me. Shit, man...
See-cil.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
Don Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
-- in a context.
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Every word.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
-- Roger --
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
What is your rank within La Compania?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I want you to kill for me.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
God damn, you people are confusing.
Can you tell me what their names were?
Yep, it sure is.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
What?
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
You are here and there is no place to go...
Sorry to hear it.
He didn't suffer.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Shorthand. Really?
What do you mean?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
I see. He does talk loud.
That's what I heard.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
It's late, Sam.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
Yes, he is like a clown.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
The usual, 9:15.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Well, why not?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Not you, Donna, not you.
Laura, I am your friend.
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
Cause I like it.
Fill 'er up.
I haven't got it yet.
I did? I didn't see anything.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Oh, yes... yes...
I already made you two tapes.
And what a muffin you have.
Let's go all the way.
It does matter. We're in love.
I can't tonight.
What's going on?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
See what?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
Trees?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I forgot my books at school.
What?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, sweetheart.
School?
Dad...
A friend from school.
A special friend?
Yes.
Stay away from me.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Look at this finger here.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Who am I?
I don't know.
That's right.
Nothing, I chickened out.
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
There's no one here.
Norma, are you alright?
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
Yes. It would be.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
It looks that way.
You know what that would mean?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
You've just said you signed it.
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Objection.
Your Honor...! Your Honor...
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Say it.
I was her doctor.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Tell me one?
We just...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Why?
I'm sorry...?
...that's perfectly all right.
Four. You're great with these kids.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Why is that?
I was held up.
Thank you for seeing me.
That's perfectly all right.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Exception!
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you? A cop?
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
I... do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No... no...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
It's locked?
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
You got a good memory, Franky.
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I can't talk now.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Hey, how about that!
Come on out!  We're friends!
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
What's he like?
Like...ah...
Where are we?
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It was...  ...one of them!
What was it like?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Have you got a pocket compass?
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
No.  I thought you had them.
It's always been a good persuader.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
He's very excited about it.
Sort of a trial balloon.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
You get any sleep last night?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Hasn't been another call, has there?
Chase. Hi...
What?  What kind of episode?
Don't speed, Chase.  It's not...
Diabetes?
No.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Your bed?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
Home, that's right.
I know he is, sweetie.  We'll both go get Rex right now.
A story?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...
You got it.  What's happening?
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I want to see for myself.
The car's no there yet?
Listen, dammit.
I just can't.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Me too.
Not yet.
Yep.
You sound so sure.
I am about this.
We were idealists.
Claiming their place in the world.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
Thank you.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
What do you mean?
Yes sir.
Yeah.
To take a piss.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
Congratulations.
What about you?
That's not why he's sending me.
Because it looks good.
It was a bad dream...
What's the difference?
I guess.
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
I'm pissin' fire man.
Passport?
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
Ya know... "It".
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
It works?
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
Sir...?
So is violating international law.
But you invited is aboard.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Why are you here?
Yes.  I do.
A padlock.
She's Cuban.
Why'd you jump?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
Trust me donut.  I know.
What?  Come on...
I figured it out.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
It seems we're short on singers.
Outer.
What's that?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
It hurts too much to care.
About anything.
But, they don't speak English.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
What?
Sorry won't cut it.
I don't know...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
Then what are you trying to say then?
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
You was in the Marines, huh?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
No.
You an indian?
No.
Ready for another?
Why not?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
No sir...
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
But I am also with the government.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Come here.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
In many capacities.
Hasta siempre.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
See ya downstairs.
You ain't actin', mama.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Why, honey?
Peanut...
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
That don't seem fair.
Yeah?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
What's that, peanut?
You certain?
You do.
Who knows, baby?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
Yeah, I'm here.
You upset with me?
If you say so.
Trust me on it.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
One bad car accident...
You think she's gonna make it?
Fan works.
Now what?
Yeah?
The only one.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Shake hands with your daddy.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
What makes sense, is all.
SAILOR!!!!
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Santos... It isn't.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Where?
In the head.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Someone's gonna see us.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
So I hear.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
You're stoned.
She's still a transvestite.
Isn't she?
I just mean...
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
He finished it Winter Break.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Shut up and drink.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Yes.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
Where would we go?
Shit.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
His parents.
Competence.
So sensitive.
Ye-es?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Evidently.  Coming!
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
The hood jumper?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Call it a hunch.
No. But I don't think that matters.
I peeked.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
You must be mistaken.
You did.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Is that in my chart?
Her dog, yes.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
No! What gave you that idea?
A little.
You're right.
This is worth it.
That's really it.
Really?
Really.
Like the lady herself.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
What's he saying?
You're welcome.
I put you on the floor.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
What'd he say?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Hm.
Well done, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Hm.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Maybe...
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
That's right. That one.
Not you. Your talent.
The hell I am.
No thanks.
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
When?
When nobody's looking.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Yes, James.
I think so... What about you?
Just checking.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Grady!
But where? I need the street.
It beats 'What's your major?'
No, it's not that, it's...
Chancellor.
I got the message you called too.
All right. This morning --
I'm pregnant.
She's left before...
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
You got me.
I love you, Grady.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
You heard? How?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
That... and you.
And the jacket?
He told me.
And what did you say?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
And you're old.
Dozens. It's very sad.
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
It didn't come up.
I know, but sometimes...
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm your man.
Sure it is.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Yes?
It's Grady, Walter.
Grady?
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
I'm in love with your wife.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
Hey, Professor Tripp.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
No, the dog.
Just kidding.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No, I'm going ho --
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
No shit.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Is it because of Anna?
Huh?
Then what? What?!
The birthday party.
Annette will see you.
When?
Soon.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Nothing.
I mean... feelings.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
It's hard to describe.
I can't.
I bet you can.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
You live around here?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Do you come here often?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I have friends.
Cop.
I have no idea.
I think you do.
Why don't you just tell me?
Got something to hide?
Doesn't everybody?
What?
Yes.
I don't know.
What?
The girl.
Know what?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Apartment's okay.
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Lovers' quarrel?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
No you're not.
How come?
Yes?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Ms. Kramer.
Yes you can, Robin.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Yes?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
Will I see you again?
You seem a little hostile today.
That was a joke.
That's right.
No way.
Why not?
Ev-i-dence.
That's right.
How's that?
No fucking way.
Then think about it.
I'm still thinking about it.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
Do you think you're crazy?
Is that what you are angry about?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
I'm afraid not.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
How do they know?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I know --
You don't know!
I want to talk about it now.
Sorry.
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
What?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
I see my sister.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed too.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Yes.
I was six years old!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
I'm talking about you.
Yeah, you.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
What do you think?
What?
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
What about them?
They could eat you.
Yeah, they could.
You're damaged.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Why do you want to know?
What?
You're still here.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
Is that all?
Hi.
Because I like you.
Yeah.
I molested little girls.
Molested little girls?
How many girls did you molest?
It's not what you think.
Twelve years in prison?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
Walter.
Yes! I want to know.
Why young girls, Walter?
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
You really believe that?
And what do you tell yourself now?
Bullshit.
I know.
The percentages --
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
No you don't.
Not ever.
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
Maybe you should be.
Live together.
Move in with me.
I've got problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
That's not what I meant.
You're such an asshole.
Prove it.
Do what?
What's your fucking problem?
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
Not when they fly.
No way that could just be seawater.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Hey, you okay?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Not for long.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
But what did he see that made him panic?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
It's trying to communicate.
Now what?
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Yeah.  So sue me.
They'll come out after us.
Calm down, Bud.
We've only got one suit.
Tell me later.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Yuh?
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Turn it up, bozo.
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
Check this out.
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
He's hallucinating badly.
This one is gorgeous.
We'll send the raft back to you.
Well, what?
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And why haven't they left each other?
No.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
What! Get married?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Why?
No reason why...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I'm too sleepy.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
It was futile. We went all over.
Do you consider that a compliment?
What do you mean by sensible?
It means being without money.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
To the shark.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Ask her.
Here I am.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
Unfortunately, no.
No. The owners are in Australia.
But where did you come from?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
They didn't seem too good.
Lady Patrizia!
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I'm a blimp.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
It's a sin to be fat.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Yes, of God.
Why?
I don't know.
Dear Jesus...
Why?
Why?
They were stained.
Say it!
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
What would you like to talk about.
Anything... may I sit down?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Who?
Uh huh.
I love you.
Who?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
Often?
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
In the confessional.
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
I fell asleep.
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
What do you mean?
Anything.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Do you have any children?
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
What?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Do you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
She'd get angry.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Is that what she said?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
What did you do?
I breathed!
I can't.
She's dead isn't she?
How?
Yes?
... makes me...
Yes?
Oh, yes.
And then...
What?
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
You're a mistake.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
To help me.
Of what?
Of telling you.
It came out of me.
Why?
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Why?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Someone's following me.
Who?
What else?
A crucifix.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
What did she mean?
Why?
Him.
She'd seen him too.
Yes.
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.
I put her to sleep.
What?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
You got to be crazy.
What about Roger? He's free.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
Do you still go to church?
What business is it of yours..?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Yes.
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And you weren't shocked?
She stopped eating completely...
About two years before.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
The Catholic Church...
I am...
What?
Aquittal.
How?
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
The sheets...
About what?
Your niece!
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Listening to angels?
I don't think I care to know.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, God.
I'd like yours too.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Bullshit yourself!
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
And what has that to do with it?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Fine thanks...
Pipe!
Right...
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Become?  One is born a saint.
I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
Would it stop you if I did?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
She's been touched by God, yes.
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Don't be ridiculous.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Why would I lie?
Hasn't she had enough?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Did you know she was pregnant?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
The scandal...
No!
Then she's a liar.
Wasn't it!
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah.
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Sixpence.
He'll be pulp by now.
They'll be here.
Well!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Bag-snatcher.
You do - repeatedly.
Do I snore?
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Yeah, grotesque.
Have I said something amiss?
It is, y'know.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
He's sulking again.
Wake up!
Sorry.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Follow your impulse.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Well, what happened?
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Something like that.
What's that mean?
Oh aye, a sledge.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Of course.
Parading's better!
Parading?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Nothing good.
Hello.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
That's all right then.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
Shall I?
Don't be callous.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Foreign devil ...
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
We were going to do it.
Come on speedy!
Sit down, the lot of you.
I would though.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Hi, our lot!
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Hello.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
And my nose...
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
Is it? Is it really?
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
You've lost him.
No, we're not!
Don't start. Look.
But...
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
It's not my fault.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Nerves.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...
Yeah, it's you all right.
Kill drive engines.
Or something will be able to see us.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Gravity?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Then take her down.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
Take a look.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
A voice transmission.
Play it for us, please.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Has the hull been breached?
Well, get started.
Right.  Talk to you.
Yeah!
What?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
It grows on you.
That way.
Dead!
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Is it alive?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Here, let me try.
What?
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Boy, that's terrific.
Careful, don't get under it!
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
Got a better idea?
Oh my God.
Does anybody know what happened?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
Can you get them back?
We're not going anywhere.
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey!  what about the film?
We sure need this flamethrower.
It's not going to work.
You lead.
My signal's fading.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Can you see anything?
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
What is it?
Yes, thank heaven.
Is it still dripping?
It appears to have healed itself.
We're going into the freezers now.
Maybe we could write it together.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Let's get moving with this net.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
What killed it?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Up one kilometer, Jay.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
We're coming!
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
... More spores coming.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Yeah...
Is it dead?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Yep...
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
And?
Get her on-line.  Now!
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Nooooo!
Do it.
Yeah?
I dunno.
What?
What?
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Yeah, I got it.
What's wrong?
How?
It's alright, it's cool...
Is it still moving?
Uh-huh.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
And before that?
Six month stint on Datus.
Real man' drink.
Want some?
Check out the tent.
Hold on...
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
You have to...
No!
'Bout five minutes.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
I believe I will.
Just some coffee.
It wasn't meant to be.
Just like it.
Frankly - yes.
You know me better than that.
Almost four.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd and I.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
A dull cliche.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You can have one at Max's.
I don't think I'm going.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Then you've heard too.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
Huh?
Where?
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Huh?
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
I get a party, don't I?
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
I'll check with Eve...
It won't play.
Cut it out.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
The audition.
The kid. Junior.
Gone.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
I mix what I like.
Don't calm down.
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Don't be condescending.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
What would you like? Texas?
Yes, dear.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why what?
I don't have to. I want to.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
Every day.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
From what would I be running?
You're quite a girl.
You think?
You hear all kinds of things.
No thanks, Birdie.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
The same size?
Of course!
Miss Coonan...
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Hmm?
No.
Why not?
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Don't be dense. The party.
Miss Harrington...
I - I guess I fell asleep.
What for?
What report? To whom?
You rest. I'll get it...
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
My husband...
Well...
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Karen.
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
You won't forget it?
I won't forget.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
I don't intend to be.
Oh, but there is-
I'm not crying.
Something most important you can do.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Over my dead body...
Thank you, Karen.
Let's get back to this one. Have you really seen every performance?  Why? I'm curious...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
The heave-ho.
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Three or four miles...
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
What about Bill?
He's in love with you.
Isn't that what they always say?
With tears.
In a minute...
They'd die without each other.
Margo!
Nothing much. She apologized.
Nothing...
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Up in the room.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
When you do, let me in on it.
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
What do you mean?
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I have no intention of having an accident!
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I don't think I could be.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
That's right, but I don't understand-
Go ahead, please...
Play it again.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
I promise.
That's my Max.
Answer my question!
I said I'm a dying man!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--no way--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Carl.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hmm.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
About the past year.
--see?--
--I'm trying--
--fifteen phone calls--
Anything you've got.
Nixon.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--shit--
--I know, I know--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
What's the matter?
Hmm?
Goddamnit!--
Night.
Oh.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
And you will.  But not now.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
That's right.
Mind if I try?
When did he hire you?
Tell that to Muskie.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
Sure--off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--what about you?--
It's right under that pile.
Just let me get a match.
What do you want to know?
No games, Irwin; give.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
I will not talk about the other two.
I'm not your source on that.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
I don't know titles.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I have nothing more to say.
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
James McCord.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
Where?
Are you sure?
But it's possible.
It is.
--well, Sloan--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
-- Thanks, coach --
Suck me...beautiful?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Uh-huh.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Do I have to?
You can call me Ostreicher.
Forget it.
Neither will I.
You don't like it?
Because I want to.
What?
You want onions?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
I'm not playing.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
You called me Oz.
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
But that one time --
Of course.
Do you love her?
Did you guys hook up or something?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
You think she was serious?
It's all good.  Breath check.
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Right.  That gives us...
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Went home to shit.
Just in time.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Dad, come in.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
I told you.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
So do I, Kev.
After high school.
I thought so.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Shame on you!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Yes, slowly.
Um...okay...
Oh no.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
You got in.
Okay, don't stop.
Not for you.
Just a second!
You want to do it?
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Me too.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
I love you.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
That's the spirit.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
I don't care.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Shut the fuck up.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Would you shut up?
But you better hurry.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
What?
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Serafine...?
It's okay. I can see fine.
Are you okay?
What?! He told you? When?
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Shit!
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You'll never get the chance.
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
What?!
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
That's McDermott, but yeah.
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Yes sir.
He says -
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
How to read.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I'm not sure but look. . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
I'm fine.
Come out! I can do alterations.
I shant!
Not you. Him.
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
Now just get off the train.
No!
It's not you - it's the dress!
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Don't be
I'll never let go!
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
How do you know?
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
He's her?
Look!
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
Ah! Let us begin!
It worked in Odessa...
Run, Anya -  go...
Remove him at once.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
I did no such thing!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
I need a large polo mallet!
You don't want my autograph.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yeah? Allison what?
Portchnik.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Well, stop listening to him.
How can you possibly oversleep?
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
All right. All right. All right.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Oh - you're an actress.
Right!  Where?
Wisconsin.
Well, where is it? I-
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Nice car.
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah, my grammy.
Your grammy!
I'll see yuh.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh, sorry.
Neat, yeah.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
it's my first time.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah?
It's terrific.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
H'm?
Yeah.
Yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
No.
H'm?
You are extremely sexy.
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Do I love you?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
U-huh.
Yeah.
You followed me!
Following is different. I was spying.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Will it change my life?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
snow shovel or anything or something.
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
What... huh?
Check it out.
Nothing at all?
I'm cool.
Remember that day?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
Oswald and ghosts.
Jesus!
Tsch, a few.
Yeah.
I mean that as a compliment.
It's a narrow view.
Yes.
Tell him.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Hey.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Whatta you mean?
Mean?
Stop calling me Max.
You'll total the whole car.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
SO?
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Yes, I do.
You think so? Do you really?
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
...of possibly working together.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
And how's the diva doing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
And you've only just met.
The movie.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
It's alright, isn't it?
I don't know how to make her funny.
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
I'll change back before we leave.
It's not going to come up.
Really.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I love her too, Joe.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
Fuck you.
Please?
Let's go upstairs, okay?
And?
Lucy overdosed.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Leave us alone right now.
We live next door.
Oh.  You're them.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
Yeah, thanks pal.
Fantastic.  Out here.
You only made half your quote this year.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
He's directing now.
They're paying him scale.
Did you invite them?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
Just do what I say, alright?
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel?
Happy anniversary.
Accept a compliment.
Through the sweats or not?
No.  I missed that.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Truce.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Well he can't have gone far.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
Otis!!!!
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
About me!
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I don't look my age, Joe.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
This is insanity.  Sally...
I wanted you back.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You're not ready.
I know.
You don't have to.
Okay.
It's a Calder.
I know.
He's my favorite.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Come on, Panes...
Sure.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Joking.
Ah there's our snookums now.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
Sally did all this herself?
And Ryan works at home.
I will treasure this.
Lemon.
Lemon it is.
That's a lot of those.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I like you.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
Trust him.
Well...wow...
Not good.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Don't go in, Ryan.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
No, no thanks.
Oh?
Thank you.
That was my clue.
The Shostakovich.
Really??
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Not enough.
Oh great.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
She's all over him, are you blind?
You see, that's worse.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Okay.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
What does that mean?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
No.  Not something new.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
Rose.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
I'll be right out.
Relax.  You've done enough.
Ah.
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
Oh Soph...
Well good.  Thank God.
I don't have a drug problem.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Tell me about it.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Right...because every ant's important!
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
I'm Princess Bala.
Divinely?
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Wait, I hear something!
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Mom!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Barbatus?
Duty calls!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Why are we so successful?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
Yeah.  How much?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
It's a bet.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Oh, I never catch colds.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Yeah.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
You shouldn't.
I thought so.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
The mirror -- it's broken.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll fix you some coffee.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
What's your friend's name?
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I am. Let me get the cards.
You don't have to entertain me.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Pick a card.
Was he really upset when you told him?
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Gin.
I just want some fresh air.
I would.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In the knee?
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Might as well go all the way.
I mean, after that?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
Of course not.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Yes, sir.
Think.
That's right, Baxter.
How would you like to go tonight?
Thank you, sir.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Put me down for Thursday again.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
What do you mean, sorry?
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
No key!
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
What does he mean, accident?
Who else?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do you want?
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
No.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Good night.
Good night?
The party's over.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Kubelik.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
I don't know.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Come on, Fran.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I missed you, Fran.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I wasn't trying.
What do you think?
I love you -- remember?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
I told you -- with my mother.
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Lovely. You were a big help.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I said I like all of them.
What !
You can keep your fucking fuel --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
What unit were you with ?
Sort of.
Yeah.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yes, sir --
Call me what, sir?
Cook school -- that did it.
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Who's he?
God knows.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Where ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
We're Americans.
While you were sleeping.
What is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Would he remember you ?
Anyone got a cigarette.
Touchy.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
This gentleman or myself ?
No, sir.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
That's right, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
What, sir?
Sure -- fine --
What?
What do you mean?
Six to eight feet.
Wh -- what?
You want'a surf, soldier?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
What's the furthest you been in?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Don't you agree?
What about this point here?
Who?
I'm Kurtz.
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
How's yours?
No water.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I was on threshold of great things.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Yeah... thanks.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
No -- leave it --
Simple. They don't want him to go.
His name is...
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
The river is beautiful.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Anyone got a card?
What?
94   CONTINUED:  
Your infrared camera?
Keep back.
She's dead.
Oh.
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
It's exactly what you meant.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
That's my line.
I'll tell you everything later.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A daughter in Oregon.
Forget it.  It would take days.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
I already have.

But I would.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Any idea who could've done it?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
They'll have to come right past us.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I want us to go out.
Uh-huh.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
I've got Jews at my table.
What do you care?
Spencer.
Okay.
Spence.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Oh, please...
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
Two days.
I can't. I work.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Is there another way to see it?
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Can we order first?
It's one idea...
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take you... why not?
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
That seems like a good choice.
Okay. Good-bye.
So long.
Were you asleep?
What do you want?
Were you asleep?
What are you doing here?
What a break...
Good night.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
I'll take care of myself --
You think you're kidding.
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
What the heck do you mean?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Two years ago...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Thanks for looking after him.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
About a dog.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Ask him.
How're you doing?
Well, that's a load off.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Please, just leave.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Come on, sweetheart...
Yo, yo, yo...
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Does it matter?
What are you talking about?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Just a second -- he has to go.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
No.  No I'm not.
What is this?
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Okay, don't.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
What?  What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
That's right.
You're too late.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
I don't believe you.
I know.  It was a joke.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
Paid in full.
It cost us.
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Turn off the engine.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
What does that mean?
He wants to kill you?
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Electra.
Just Electra?
Yeah.
No.  Just Electra.
Why?
Better than playing with yourself.
Why?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
How old were you?
You were like a boy genius?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Good.
Where is it?
Mexico.
About?
Nothing.
You were there?
Why not?
Work.  The things I need to get done.
In Costa Blanca.
Yes.
Really?
Sorry.
The beach?  It was nice.
Transmits and receives.
Then, we wait.
Yes.
Yes.
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Yes.  Here I am again.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
I went into their room this afternoon.
Nobody ever sees me.
No?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Am I attractive?
Why?
It can be.
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
She was taken.
Did you --
Uh-huh.
I'm not normal.
Martin.
What?
Electra --
What?
Last night --
Yes.
Oh, God.  I see it!
Yes.  Please come in.
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Honesty.
Do you believe that?
Anytime.
I hope not.
Shit... oh well.
That's exactly what I told myself.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
You mean quit?
Yeah.
I have all day.
Thank you.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
What did the beer cost?
An alternative literary venue!
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I've been saying that since we met.
But how did the wall get here?
Don't we have enough already?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Yeah, I'll take some.
Have you ever stolen anything?
No, for the Asylum.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
When your ready Son!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Both, see you later.
You're all bloody useless.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
What are you on about?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Huh?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Now you're using that word.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Good, what's his number?
Some deal you did there!
Here!
Sure I'm sure!
Yeah, pretty well.
That one?
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
Turn around quick!
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Here's the details.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
There's nothing there for me.
But I love you!
Not this time, Kat.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Yo, dobree!
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Insurance!
No, it should be over soon.
You mean it's started?
We don't need you.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah seems okay.
No, just a coffee.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Yeah, but it was okay.
How did he look?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
And you broke into that room?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
No!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
Working....Under cover.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Come on, that shit can wait.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Go to hell!
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
I. Don't. Dance.
Heart be still.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'm sorry about how we --
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
About a job.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
No. I won't be long.
Were you with Jamie?
I meant he's a doctor.
I didn't know either.
He wants to talk to you.
I'm just wondering --
York Ave.
Demented.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
No. Not like you.
Kinda. Yeah.
Do you think I'm strange?
That is my telescope.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for something -- someone.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
In ten words or less?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
You don't believe in anything?
Your father doesn't like me.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
I'm really glad you think so.
You don't miss a thing.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That would be the reason.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Then maybe you can read mine.
Thank you. So were you.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
It's not.
Prove it.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
What?
You.
I wanted this to be a date.
No.
We're doing something -- ?
Fun.
Where?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Twice a year.
Where?
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
I was twelve.
Hoped for it.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
I'm sick.
I should have told you sooner --
Anything you want.
Nothing.
I used to like yogurt.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
Tired.
Better. I was really angry.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
He wants help with his lines --
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Ever again.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Either. Both.
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
Yes. You?
Getting by.
She did. It was you.
You don't. That's the point.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Where did you get -- ?
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
Are you?
What do you want, Biff?
Where's your old man?
This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
But he does! Don't you see?
How are you?
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Good.
Okay, then!
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
And where am I gonna be?
In the parking lot, with her.
Why what?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Five cents, please.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
Nineteen fifty --
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right... 
...To be traveled through
Then where the hell is he?
So what? We'd be rich!
You know me?
Professor, be serious, would you?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Curious... Very curious....
You did what?!?
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
A Tab.
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Hi, Marty!
What did you do to yours?
Well, he's gone.
Gone?... Where?
Can't afford to take chances.
Not bad.
She plays the clarinet, too.
No, he showed me one.
He never bit me.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
You like people?
They're okay.
Tom...
I mean it.
Yeah.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
You love him?
I don't know.
Nah, I got me a job.
Yeah.
There you go.
Quit my job.
Great.
Bring it along.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
I can look and see.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Yeah, me too.
I don't know.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Positive?
Yes.
It was going too fast.
I just don't want to go.
Yes.
Just thinking.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's mine all right.
Just gimme a chance.
No.
Not me. No way.
They're stealing my chopper!
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Same one you had yesterday?
First thing I did.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
Where's the professor?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
Now!
To get my guns.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
It's kinda hard this way.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Oh, my.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
You look!  It's not here!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
I didn't drop 'em.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
No!  Ditto the professor-
How about you? Will you be alright?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
What. What don't I understand?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Who is this?
Chet!
Chet! From downstairs!
Garland, it's me.
A week, eight, nine days –
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Just Bill, please.
It's still a little early for me.
I need help, Audrey.
...Huh? No, I'm –
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
A souse!
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little–
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Charlie. How are you.
Ready... wrestle!
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Are you sure –
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
You gotta believe me –
Hold on –
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
I'm at the Earle.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Nine days – Tuesday –
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
Would that be good enough for ya?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
All of which he's now missin'.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Were you drinking?
When did you start drinking again?
How about the coke?
No?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What else is new?
Catherine Tramell.
I thought you quit.
No, Nick, please --
Who?
Nilsen.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
I quit.
It won't last.
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.  Come in.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
There's a name from the past.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Didn't you study it in school?
Do you?
Why not?
Ice?
My wife used to call me that.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
It's not the same thing, is it?
Why take the risk?
Fine.  How's your back?
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I don't have a choice.
Make love to me.
No?
Try me.
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
I told you.  She kills him.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
He was murdered.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nope, can't say that I do.
That's him.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
Hallelujah.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
Somethin', though.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
I went over last night, too.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I feel fine!
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Why not?
You're my friend, Gus.
If she's telling  you the truth.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
I'm going with you.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
We bring her in for questioning.
I'm sure.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
Fuck you, too Nick.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
On what basis?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Only if you're making it.
I'm a painter, too.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I don't know.
When's your show?
Not sure. How was yours?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
The whole thing – painting.
It's in New Jersey.
New York.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
What's wrong?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
Annina Nosei.
Who?
Aren't they?
You should talk to him about this.
I know.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I know that. Don't let him get away.
What do you mean?
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
I need a dealer.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Not black.
Yeah.
Very well.
Out?
Still not here.
– In this corner?
Yeah..
SAMO.
Oh yeah..
Your people.
Hi Gina.
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
Good. What do you have?
Come on, let's get out of here.
I think I could do that alone.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You don't have any fucking money..
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Staten Island would be ok.
Think so?
You're your own baby.
Hi.
What's that?
Pretty much the same.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?
Hi.
Some of them.
Stand still.
Thanks
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Have a Mac.
I don't eat junk food.
What time is it?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I can't. After the show.
Yeah.
I need this?
It's vichyssoise, sir.
No, actually I feel worse.
I think I'll take the stairs.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
"Shreck's."  You --
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
What're you really after?
Have we?
Yes and no ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm tempted.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Had one.  Didn't work.
And the truth frightened her?
Sure.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Dad!  Save yourself!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Silent night, violent night...
All is shrill, all is blight...
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Too late for what, dear child?
The boys need help.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
What seems to be the problem?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
What exactly are you doing?
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
Surf's up.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Definitely.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Just the beast.
She knows who we are.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
What?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Where is my wife?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
...Afraid.
What?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Recognition, of course.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
How ya doin', Al?
Just checking, young sir.
Four seconds from...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
We'll talk some other -
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
Banzai.
Just ones this beautiful.
What do you know about obsession?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What? This isn't normal?
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
What?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
You do know. Try.
What?
Excuse me.
Who is it?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
...You gonna kill me?
What say we flip for it?
Never heard of a double-cross?
Here. Get a good seat.
Everything.
Miss.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
The small one.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
WHICH CAR?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
Well -- I think you might consider
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
... We could try that.
... Looks like a convention.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
What now?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
WHAT??
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
That's it.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Yum, yum.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Not what?
He's not crazy.
You okay?
I said I'd check with you.
Tom Jones?
Hi.....  Roses.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Meaning?
About Charles...
Annie, it's me.
Night.
Uh ... yes ...
Excuse me.
What?  What?
What happened?!!!
Ahm.... .
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
And a car.
Mmmmm...
Sean Connery.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
I vote for Bart.
How the hell should I know?
Yes?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Why thank you sir.

Yer late.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
I see it. I don't get it.
Deep and hard.
Where did these guys come from?
Agent Hurley...
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
You'll be rich!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
I am sitting.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This is going to take some time.
What's she doing here?
No, I'm not putting up with this.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Then it should be here.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
You can build another one... with her.
Just a hunch.
3:30 I guess.
Is this like a trick question?
We were trying to scare your mother.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Really.  I don't know.
W... We didn't know how to make one.
No.  What's wrong?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
You're the dead.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Life is just... too awful.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Are you a spirit too?
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
No, dummy.  Two.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Just <u>say</u> it.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
... I will.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
He's your cousin.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Why not?
Delia hates it.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
... sheets.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Delia will cook...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
I saw some ghosts.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Maybe Charles does.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at the tiny figures.
I don't know.
Their wedding clothes.
But not for long...
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
Yes, Robert. I will.
No, Robert.
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I am.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
My name is Chance.
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Our greenhouse.
Yes, so do we.
Hello, Eve.
Good night, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. I like to watch.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?
... Are you sure you like it?
I see.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
And I'm Ben.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
I never needed money.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Of course. I would like to look.
... Yes sir - elevator!
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
I have no claim, Thomas.
But you won't sign, correct?
Sid, it's useless!
I said - try again.
Good evening, Wilson.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
I said good night!
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
... Well?
I'm afraid so.
You take care too, Bobby.
John Makel...
Malkovich!
I never played a jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
I don't know.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Yeah. Okay.
I... puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Just an idea I had.
Hi.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
The iguana.
Right.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
We'll talk about it in the car.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
You've always loved the animals.
Us, of course.
Fuck Maxine.
We wish.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Don't forget me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Shut up!
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
I'm a puppeteer.
The iguana?
The monkey.
I'm sorry for everything.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Let me try.
That... was... no... simulation.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.
Yes?
Yex?
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
I wouldn't know.
I'm right?
Who told you?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
It better be.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
I've fallen in love.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Hello. Wendy.
Can I be anyone I want?
You can be John Malkovich.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Why are you being like this?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Think, Jew florist?
Good morning, Lotte!
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Count me in.
Oh, be still my heart.
No you mustn't, my child.
You bastard!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
I love you, Lotte.
One hour.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Is there dancing?
No.
Who needs dancing?
Mr. Malkovich?
Who's calling?
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
I'm getting better all the time.
I'd love to see your work.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Derek Mantini!
Whatever.
Folks come. Folks go.
Here, let me carry that.
That's the last thing they took from me.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
Was a time I knew what was.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
and she is mine...
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
Baby, don't be like that.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
I don't. I have my own.
Yes sir
What you want?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
In case of what?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Well, what can you do?
No, let her rest.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning, ma'am.
Go upstairs I said!!
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Mama?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Can't locate him.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Till she showed herself.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Never found out.
You don't know what I think.
She was only-
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Paul D.
Yeah. Look bad?
No, You looking good.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Yes sir.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Oh, man, don't say that..
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah, it sucks.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
That fucking bitch!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
What's that, Walter?
Where's your car, Dude?
They were Nazis, Dude?
Am I wrong?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Please!  Please!
Uh-huh.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
No, they--
Color?
And was there anything of value in the car?
Your rug was in the car.
Mm.
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?
Yeah.  Thanks man.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Thank you.
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
No it's fine, really, uh--
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
So Dieter has the money?
Maude?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
I want a child.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Okay. That, uh.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Calmer than you are.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
The fucking point is--
It's your roll.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Whose toe was it, Walter?
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Not exactly a lightweight.
Look, man, did you--
Is this your homework, Larry?
Shit yeah!
You know this!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Come on, Walter!.
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha. . . Donny--
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
You're a fuck, Walter!
Who is this?
Right, Dude.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Huh?
Well we--I don't--
Well. . . yeah.
Am I wrong!?
A world of pain.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's half yours, partner.
Survival.
The House of Pain.
Nothing.
I'll heal.
What about Nomak?
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
I don't think so.
For what?
Not good.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Took you long enough.
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I'll show you.
Where the hell have you been?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Thought you were dead.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
He was here.  Watching us.
Getting your attention, Paco.
You experimented on your own, son?
Maybe it's better that way.
Two so far.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
You should've killed her, then.
Don't even start, old man.
How can you be out here?
Watch me.
Frost!!!
Take him.
But I just got here --
You've been here longer than you think.
I'm sorry, I --
You're joking --
It worked, didn't it?
He didn't. Get over it.
Preventive medicine.
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
You don't know that.
What do you see here?
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Like me.
Some kind of archive --
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
You get used to the darkness.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Cancer.
Some. It's been slow --
You don't look so good.
You make it sound like I'm already dead.
I've been better --
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
You're a week early.
I was in the neighborhood.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Deacon brought me back.
Fight him --
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
What?
You've been listening in the whole time?
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
--which she may have--
What happened to her, where did she go?
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
--my God, Nick???
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--a six week bun in the oven--
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
So whoever built this--
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
What?
You sure?
<u>Yes</u>.
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Your body, your call.
Why is there no "our" here?
--fine, later, fine.
I don't know.
I don't know. Nightmare.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Just now?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Then I'm going--
Whatever you want.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--hours before--
Looks like a rope.
I can't let you in.
I want amphetamines.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
--no, I think they're all in there.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
--there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I do.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
No fucking.
Butt-ugly owl.
What're you, nuts?
--coming out of the water--
What?
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Don't have one.
Fucking owl!
How's she going to know where to--
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
--I don't know.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
For "James?"
What?
--about the Witch--
--a Wiccan--
I'm not finished.
This isn't about us.
Look over there.
--now there.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
I can't!
Ah, Domini?
What?
--and we brought it back with us!
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Elly Kedward?
What'd you say?
....I don't know.
What?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
I know, I know--
Sure. I'm sorry.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Shoot.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
You're needed here--keep watching--
--fuck Anna!
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Does she, goddamnit??
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--the Sheriff's Office--
Your mother's pastor.
What happened to my Dad??
Well I do...
Yeah.
What was that?
Your husband.
See a guy.
What?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Door's locked. Nothing there.
I couldn't believe it either...
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
...You ever get tired?
You're bad.
In the trunk.
What do you want to know?
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
Going out with Meurice.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
What's the matter?
Sign.
What do you mean...
Most of the night...
No. It just made them feel better.
I didn't say that.  Well?
What do you think?
You're an idiot.
Ya catch any fish?
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Nah, I trust ya.
Has Ray come in yet?
I don't know, didn't he call?
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What.
What.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I've seen a few.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?

Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Oh yeah, that's good.

See my nipples?
Yes.
Yes, I like you.

Yeah. hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.

No.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Please. please stay.
Hello.

Frank is coming?
Are you a bad boy?
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.

I want you to stay with me.
I think I better go.
My secret lover.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.

On a ride.
Here's to Ben.

Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
I don't know. he moved away.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Let's go.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Okay. yeah, call.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.

Twice. without her sensing anything?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
Okay, Sandy.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
You want to go talk to him?
Jeffrey?. Why?
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
... You look beautiful.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Dorothy Vallens?
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
... Sandy?.
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff.
Are you feeling okay?
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
This is it.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Yeah.  I am.
Yeah.  I am.
Are you kidding?
We'll take it.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
You're a fucking amateur!
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Yeah.  She told me.
I don't want to talk about it.
No?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
What kind of project?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
No, my brother.
Because they caught me?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Allo?
Diego?  It's George.
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
I just got released five minutes ago.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Try the back bedroom.
Try the closet.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
I did not.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Cocaine?  How much?
In how long?  A week?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming.
And Diego?
Diego is my brother.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Yeah.
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
I'm going to California.
I'm going to California.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Not mad.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Good.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
I meant every word of it.
What do you guys want?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
Tuna.
Hello.
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Better than you.
How are you doing?
What?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
California.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
There's schools in California.
You swear?
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
They're over at the booth.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
That's right.
Don't be such a pussy.
No. It has failed in its objective.
Exactly.
It depends on you.
Second name.
Sail.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group.
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Don't move, Hacene.
What's happened to you?
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Sure ...
Here?
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
A name?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You got something on the coke?
No -- but I got something.
Cause?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
What induced it?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What did they argue about?
Your witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
Aren't they all?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
Why did you come by?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
How long were you together?
For about one year.
I had bypass surgery.
And how are you now?
Why not?
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Did you ever see her again after that?
What did she say?
I was angry.
I suggest it never happened.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
High school?
No.
We dated for about a month last year.
How?
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
That bastard!
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
No further questions.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Something like that.
We're not animals.
How?
I know.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Of course.
It's only the beginning.
You can see me now.
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
No -- you're not.
No -- I'm a survivor.
She's waiting in the conference room.
I love you too, Dad.
-- But it's Sunday.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
You better.  Please answer the question.
This is not relaxing.
Really.
I'm always open to learning new things.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Yes.
Why don't you talk to him now?
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
Talk to me.
It was a place to start.
That's too bad.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
No -- never.
Well, that's a long time.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Why are there two deeds here?
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
No. You can have them.
Well, there's a problem.
Michael.
What?!
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Oh, yes.
Not this kind of heat.
Heat is heat.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
That's it.
Hmm-mmm.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh! You caught me.
Want another cigarette?
Sure.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure.
Not at all.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Must be nice having kids.
Clean?
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
I think so.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
We got engaged.
Oh you!
You get used to it.
No. I'm all right. It's working.
What?
Francesca?
What?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
No. I was just... No.
I would love to come for dinner.
Yeah. See you later.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Oh, how is he?
Are you hungry?
No.
What?
Yes.
How about Bari?
I sat outside and had coffee.
Why do you say that?
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
What were your parents like?
Am I too heavy for you?
Yes, thanks.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
It's only four days.
Hmm?
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Okay.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
They're not going to find her!
Apparently just before her death.
You people really don't like dogs.
Hell no!
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Climb out to where?
Anywhere but here.
That's some terrible shit.
Bones.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
I said, no thanks.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Where we'll always be...
Hush, baby.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
How did you get in here?
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Then fuck it!!!
I have to finish this for class.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Please.  It's for your own good.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Your father.  He was your father.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
Bill!  Bill?!
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Dad?
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
It was just like in my head.
Not that I remember.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
What we have to do is call the police.
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Admit what?
Open the case!
You don't need a key.
The same way you did before.
What are you talking about?
Where is it?
Where's what?
The money!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
Give it to me.
All part of the business.
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
What are you, drunk?
No!  They're still on their way.
It was him.  I'm positive.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The hell I can't!
I need you ...
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Who are you going to call?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
He can't kill you --
You need the money just like we do.
You murdered Gino!
They were in a car accident.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
You know he would have done you, too.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
What?  How about a drink?
Sure.
Where is it?
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
Yeah, that's it.
Where in the hell is he?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Leave your phone on the hook.
How do I know you are cops?
You did the right thing.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
What do you want?
A beer?
A beer.  Of course.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
...  yes.
Tell me about it.
You have to ask?
I'm glad you did.
So am I.
Nothing.
I'm not afraid of anything.
What the fuck was it?
Then what?  Exactly.
Good.
...  shit.
Sweet Jesus.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Shit!  Oh shit!
If he does ...
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
Why?
Thank you.
What happened?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Hey.
How'd it go?
I'm here, aren't I?
...  Me neither.
I think everything is okay.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
...it's a problem...
What do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
So it's time to go home.
That's all I get?
We have to go home, Jason.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Get the kids out!
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Sir, you waited on line.
Yeah, I know...
Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes, I'm here...
You are a friend of his?
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's a little late for that.
Get the fuck away from my car.
I want to go home.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
What does that mean?
Listen to what you want.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I don't know.
I was shot twice in the back.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
I can't believe I slept.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I didn't know this would happen.
-- there's no time --
-- how? --
It's a company... MPG Capital.
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
This your store?
Yes.
Not really.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
He run away often?
I'm sorry.
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
xxxxxx
What's that?
Tell him we're busy.
I tried.
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't know.
Thank you.
I fixed it myself.
... fix themselves.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
... ere please.
What? How do you know my name?
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
It's reply paid.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Remember how they used to stick out?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Are you officer 412/L?
What?
How much do you know?
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
Christ! You do know it all!
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
He's a freelance subversive?
Very smart.
Tell me about Layton.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
They weren't at school with us.
We don't make mistakes.
Do you know what you're doing.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Shut up!
What?
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Good!
Please!
Oh, sorry.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
It's my fucking life.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Where are you taking me?
A heavy Christmas present.
No, really.
Really.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
What?
Who will?
Security.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Will you please turn back.
Turn!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
We? Don't blame me!
"And your children all gone."
Please, Jill ... I love you.
No you're not!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Are you sure?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not our mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
You've been promoted.
The refund for Tuttle!
Next of kin!
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Can I forget it?
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
You haven't switched it on.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
It's something for executives.
This isn't rare!
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Who's that? 
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
But I could be anybody.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
I don't know which numero.
Central Services.
What is it?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Thermostat's gone. And then some.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
No. Wait here.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She say she in great pain.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
We are virgins.
He looks like a cop.
Sleeping in the back.
Just take it easy.
No!
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No way, man.
IB Bangin.
What did you say?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
No, I'd better not.
Sure, sure, give go.
I know him. That's Noel.
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
I guess there's always a chance.
The first is always the best.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
Did you see my father?
Sleeping.
He's better.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
How long you been doing this?
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
You asked me not to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
Frank.
Come on up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
It's coming.
I quit! I'm through!
You can't leave me now.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
Crazy fucker.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I've taken that into consideration.
It's early for him.
Better bring it all.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Do it!
Frank!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
What?
You're burned out.
Faster!
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
You really think so?
Used to be my partner.
You sure?
No way!
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You've made my dreams silly.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
What?
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
They booted me out of Washington.
I don't think so.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Which would you prefer?
Ravenous homosexual.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Why do you say that?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Eleven and a half.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Did you shoot their boots?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Not because you have to.
Good.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Speaking.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Yeah --
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
So I quit.
Move away from me.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Yes.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I'll never tell.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
Yes?
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
He said something about...
Let me hear it!
Right there, Bobbie.
Yes.  That's right.
One's enough.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
I'll speak to you.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
They fired me.
Okay, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
I was a lot earlier.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
How's it going?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Excited.
Yeah?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'll be the judge of that.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
No.  Were you going to you?
We can go together.
Great.
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Where are you?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Yes.
Okay.  Good night.
Good night??!
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
Go ahead -- what?
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Through the closet.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Not anymore!
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Uh-huh.
N-no...
I already told you I'm not.
Anything new?
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
He made a cat.
Righto.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Murdered man.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Carla...
Here here...
All about me...
Every word...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Are you ready?
Bye!
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What?
Is it?  I've forgotten.
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Yeah, right outside the door!
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Got carried away, huh?
Enough already about it - get to work!
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What, Mr. De Santis?
Just wait till you see this!
Put it down, Walter.
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Uh, hi.
Yeah I did.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Turn around!
Walter shut up and relax!
NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Yes, get rid of them...
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Good morning Walter!
Your work, the layers of irony.
T-turned on?
Then let me give you something then...
If you see him.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
What's the matter with you!
Shut up!  You let him have it!
Cheer up.  You may still.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Litter, yeah!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Yes!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Amazing!
We hate you guys!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
I mean it.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
What's playing there?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
Yeah?
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
Something like that.
It's the news, Buffy.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
I thought we were meeting here.
I'm here with Jenny.
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I am so sure.
Hi there.
Is that your car?
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Yeah?
Why'd you come back?
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Merrick...
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Come again?
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Get away from me!
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
) What do you think?
Please.  It's so '91.
Why don't we see a movie?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Cafe Blase.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
Cramps?
This is it.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Skip it.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Same one.
Oh.
You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Five.
How can you keep doing this?
It isn't important.
I'm curious, is all.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
I was just scared is all.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
Thank you very much.
I guess.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Later for it.
Hi.
My parents have money...
Swear to God.
I don't understand.
You are much more.
Could be.
Good.
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
Okay, let's go.
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Okay.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Does Jeffrey know?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
You want some punch?
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please.
Right!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Nice much.
Like you've got a grip.
Right.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
My right nostril?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
A little better.
Get over here.
No.
How 'bout a back rub?
You can't seduce me.
I know what it is.
I'm trying to play with your body!
I knew it--you're seducing me!
What'd he say?
it's okay..
I won't be needing these anymore.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
I don't dance.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Yep.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Let me.
You got me all confused.
Aren't we all?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
No.
I heard already.
What?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
You need a nickname.
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
If you believe in Voodoo.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You spit on me!
I didn't spit on you!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
You're outta here!
Don't think.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Well, I held it like an egg.
How?
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Let go of me!
C ' mon!
Forget it.
You too...Meat.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Love to--
I ain't hitting a man first.
Hit me in the chest with this...
See ya at the yard, Meat.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
We're getting married.
Ain't he warning up?
It's a league record.
Struck out eighteen...
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
...and one helluva guy.
Check it out.
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Ain't here.
Well, I'd rather not say.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
What?
Hello, Senator.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
I'm serious. No interference.
The worst was Blue.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
All right, take care.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Help, Daddy!
I can't! I'm tied!
Wh-wh -
I don't know.
Ohhh...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
How did Nicky collect?
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
All right, Ace?
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
In so many words, yes.
Listen...
Hey.
You should say so.
I'll be honest with you.
All right, fine.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
I lost control?
Yeah.
...to me.
She came to talk to me...
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
What - what, Caesar's?
No, a...
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
She was afraid to call you.
Sammy.
It's me.
Nick?
How'd you know I was here?
I'll be right there.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
How do you do?
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
You bet.
Seven o'clock?
Seven o'clock.
And they were usually right.
Ace, listen to me.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
...position...
No. Just stop everything.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Call security.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Here we go. Good luck.
What is it?
Oh, no.
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
See you, Ginger.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
But mostly...
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
I'm not crying. 
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, it's so soft.
It's nice isn't it?
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
What do you need?
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You can't make me stop caring...
No, you don't.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
...under?
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
And...
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
You're not takin' Amy.
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
She had the same.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I was with somebody.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
Just wait there for me!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Don't you threaten me!
Let me in the house! Fucker!
If she calms down...
They had all the pieces they needed.
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
How many kids do you have?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
So, you're a righty?
Ye-yeah.
What?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Thank you.
Yeah.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Yeah, thanks.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Please.
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Here we go!
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Is that what you did?
I did - I didn't -
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Is that the last one?
Great!
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
What're you gonna do?
And I mean... that's no good.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Fine.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, Sammy.
I can see that. Sure.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Yeah.  Thanks.
Yeah.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
You know?
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Is that what you want?
A sponsor.
Yeah.
It's what you want?
Yeah. Uh-huh -
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
But I saw something...
What's the matter?
Get lost?
Yes.
Come on! 
Okay?
Yeah.
Do you know that?
Here.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
I think that's it.
All right.
Two?
You know why, right?
Why?
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
You jag-off.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
Hey, Shelly. 
But he never talked.
They're havin' a good time too.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
Hey.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I'm positive.
You're a little confused?
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Oh, sorry -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Then do it the way you want.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Adonis, be polite. She's a friend.
Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
I'm sure.
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
"Well done," Cactus.
What did you say?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
I know.
You think so?...Selina?
You've seen me...
Spear.
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
You turned around!
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Thanks.
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
You could've killed us.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Why would I do that?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
It's taken care of.
That's your "rep."
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
What am I supposed to do?
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
And what're you whispering for?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I don't want to know --
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Then hang up!  Do it!
What makes you say that?
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Shit!
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Tell me what she looks like.
How much time do you have left on it?
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I can hear you again, clearly.
She's gone --
What bank?
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Don't say that.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
What's going on?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
What did you do?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Can you walk?
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
What's that supposed to me?
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Naturally.
That's how it's going to be.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
You mustn't hang up.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
We don't see you.
I still don't see you.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Don't worry.
Put the girl on.
Better reassure him.
Call me "Nels."
What does it take to kill you?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
How do you know?
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Mind if I have a look?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Doesn't everybody?
I thought so.
Yeah.
So who's he?
Whatever you say.
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
What you think?
Nice.
What would you call it?
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
Saw it, Dil.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking men, Col --
Did I?
You fucking did.
You heard me --
It's Dave.
Please, Dil --
Fuck off back to Essex!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Fuck off, Dave.
It's a simple question.
Off his wages.
Bloody right I do...
In a way.
Who?
What's his name?
No.
Scottish?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Jimmy?
Not me.
Must be.
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
You know.
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
You want one?
Jesus.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
How different?
Yes.
That's good...
What do you think?
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Like you're concerned.
A real gentleman...
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm thinking of your man.
No...
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Never said a truer word.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
I said stop it.
Nothing's wise.
So I'm sorry.
Will you meet me again?
Whenever. Tonight.
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Sorry.
You can always pretend.
I'm working on it.
Sorry.
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Delirious.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Okay.
Why, honey --
You following me?
What's her?
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
You could say that.
I'm not sure.
No. Sit down.
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
It's a secret.
You promise?
I promise.
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
For you...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
No! I'm going home...
Prescription. For my condition.
What condition?
Only in times of extreme stress.
I will be.
Jimmy?
What?
Your soldier.
Are you listening?
In a manner of speaking.
It was you...
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Try and go, then.
I like you, Dil --
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What happened to Jimmy?
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
I promise.
Carnations.
You know her, Jimmy?
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Need to go across the water.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Do you want some food?
Horny bastard.
Someone's got to do it.
My pleasure.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
You're never out, Fergus.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
You know what. Go.
Perfect.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Yes?
Some judge...
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Do you want a cup of tea?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
It's your decision.
I told him.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
What?
I'm sure.
Who'd you think it was?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Just a girl.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Yeah.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
So, what do I look like?
Can't we take it off?
Only joking.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Kill me.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
No.
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Don't I know it.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
Yeah?
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
My special friend.
I've often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Don't think that way.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I told you not to talk that way --
I'm sorry.
How can I?
A story.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
What?
Hurling --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
And you know what?
Tell me, Jody
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
Whatever you say, Jude...
It was fun while it lasted.
You shut your face --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
He believes in the future --
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
No, we are.
I think that's what you ordered.
It's lovely.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Open up.
Lord, you're stubborn.
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Yes, you told me.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Don't be an idiot!
I'm through listening to you!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Oh, I see.
But I don't have it.
Thanks very much.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Because they're still here.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Very good.
Next, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
No.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
That's the idea.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
I'm not fifteen.
Said what?
I think I love you, Alex --
That sounds like their problem.
I'll be right there.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Or Tex?
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
Hm?
I'm scared.
No --
How often do you go through this little ritual?
I don't believe it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Forty-five thousand.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Why bother him?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
What do you want?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
I'm very cold.
Swiss.
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
About how wealthy would you say?
It is all right.
I wish you wouldn't.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
And this?
And this? And this?
No -- in my room.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.
Please, not on my account.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
I don't know where to go.
I'm still having trouble with English.
The man and the woman are married --
You mean you and me?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Lay on, MacDuff.
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
What was what?
Where?
How about once more around the park?
Nothing. Good night.
Good night.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
That's all.
How do you know what they're doing?
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Yes?
Wha -- what do you want?
Ça alors! From Charles?
Because I don't love him.
I've never seen him before.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
He's allergic to him.
The American Embassy.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
Not my imports.
Good.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Daddy you scared me!
You're grounded Friday night!
You said that two weeks ago.
What's wrong?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
How much further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
You are upset.
I'm not.
Are you sure?
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
No I wasn't.
What did you hear?
Run!
She just turned off her light.
Did you warn her?
She's underage.
She's not here.
I can.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Mark Shale.
Why?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
FINE. Are you?
I won't.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Follow me.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
You heard about that?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I'm fine.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Sharon's far from a slut.
What?
Pretend we're just another couple.
Mom?
Yes?
Yeah. Who is she?
What?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes.
Are you Jody?
Kenny's aunt?
Just thinking about something.
I got to go.
Hi Sandy.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
That wasn't me ...
I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
You're being unfair.

Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Where from?
Honest?
That's too bad.
Yes, his girlfriend.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
What about her?
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
With her mother.
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
Just bring your checkbook.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
I think I'll kill her.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.

C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
Shut up.  Go on.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Yeah.
Well, let's go.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Yes.
Well yes.
What are you having?
Iced tea.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Please call first.
...Just a minute...
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
He told you?
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
I mean I can't tell you.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No reason.
I don't believe you.

It's not completely dry.
Yeah.
Sure you do.
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
Water and Power?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
He's not in, Mr.?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He owned it.
They were partners.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Yeah.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Well, you never know, do you?
Why'd she run away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
That's right, Modern Times.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
We'll talk about that later.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Somebody stole it.
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
Where is he?
That's all there is.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You don't really think so?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Who else did you see?
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Charlie?!
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Hello, Bernstein.
Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
We've got a nice plant here.
Is it good?
Yes, Mr. kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Emily -
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Charlie, please don't -
Hmm!
No.  They've passed on.
In the water.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  But you're close.
A rooster?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
I mean in New York.
Half past eleven.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
Yes.
You can't stop me.
Don't go, Susan.
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir -
Can't say, sir.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
A wasted day.
Yes?
Yes?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Rawlston is my boss.
Was he in love?
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Yes, sir.
Yes and no.
Well, thanks a lot.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I had a toothache.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
What is this, a poll?
You think I'm shitting you...
This? How long have you been smoking?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I join in?
Exactly.
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
Awww. That was so cute.
You two better quit it.
I feel nauseous.
No, don't!
Dante. You've got a customer.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
It's not what you think.
Well... kind of, sort of?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
There's more, isn't there?
You don't have anything to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
You mean, on a date?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
He's your fiancé.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just kidding.
I left like an hour ago.
Nobody. It was closed.
With this guy locked in?
Yeah.
Pack of cigarettes.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
I'll assess all I want!
I can whip your ass.
Yes.
What's your point?
Yeah.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
Go open the sore.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Did you tell Veronica?
Eight and a half?
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
Allan Harris.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
I think it's safe to say yes.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
The Emperor.
She's in here?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
Why not?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Why'd you apologize?
What?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
You've got a customer.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Then where're we gonna play?
Exactly. They drank it all.
No, I'm serious.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Why not?
It's today.
What!?
She meant nothing to you!
I can't close the store.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
Broke his neck.
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
Oh, my god.
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
Yeah, but at what a price.
Reach what?
You know.
What, your dick?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
You want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I know I'm your hero.
I like to expand my horizons.
Five hundred dollars.
Holy shit. That girl?
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
I'm not.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Shut the fuck up!
This life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Got one. Just pulled up.
Same time. What about you?
To say the least.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
Just the paper.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
I'm her sister.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
How much can you bench?
I don't know.
To you?
'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You calling me a liar?
I'm trying.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
I hate this fucking place.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
She called you, didn't she?
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Really?
I was kidding.
How do you figure?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many what?
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three?
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Why do you say that?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
How many?
Dante...
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lower your voice!
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
I'm going to class.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
And that made you feel better?
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Fuck you.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
It stings a little.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Can I have your name please?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
What's this?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
Feel that.
That's tight. Solid.
I like the way you think.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I beg your pardon!
You hope what feels good?
Screw you!
You're gonna be at John K's party?
You're not?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Dental School.
Says who?
Twenty bucks.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
How yo doin', Gabe!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
I copy.
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
You're getting warmer!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
We'll never know, will we?
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Take the gun.
Hi, Gabe.
Fine, I guess...
One...
Nice and easy...
Six...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Just hangin' out.
We spent a night there one night...
You couldn't.
Excuse me?
Did I miss something?
Which could maybe what?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Flare up of old emotions...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
What if he can't?
Excuse me?
It was great.
You attacked me.
No, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
Yeah?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Breathtaking.
Up ahead.
Get it!
What?
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Jess, c'mon...
Don't let me fall!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Now you get burned.
What the hell's going on?
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
It looks like a winding route.
There.  You blind?
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
Climb, Gabe, climb!
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Then go fetch.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No names, this is an open line!
Good morning, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
Try the wine!
No, my health doesn't allow it.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Yes. They want to help.
Help you.
Who are they, sir?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Fine, fine.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Let me get up.
Murder, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Blue eyes?
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
No, sir.
Lice?
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Vitamins will it be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Just part of hospital routine.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. I'm glad
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
Prison custody?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Sir.
Are you feeling better?
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You got a deal.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
Travel...and things.
Yeah.
But not now?
Just had one.
Dozen times a day.
Max...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Sorry?
Wouldn't dream of it.
I never bought that.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
This isn't our goddamn game!
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
What's your name?
Vincent...
Of course!
I got caught up at work.
I'm standing right here.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
Who the hell is this?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Who is this?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
You should start a union.
Why not?
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Max?  I'm Vincent.
Yeah.
It's not me.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
I tried it.
I think so.
It's a mess.
So?
How long, you figure?
Yes.
Play music.
What'd he do to you?
How can you kill him like that?
Believe it.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I need the job.
No you don't.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
What?
I don't understand...
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
I listen to classical.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
Leave me alone.
She's in the hospital.
What difference does it make?
Oh, I'm captivated.
Don't start.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Doesn't cover everything.
Why?
No.
Paid sick leave?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
There you go...!
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
As in...? 
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Excuse me?
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Why the hell not?
I, uh, I have some problems.
You turned up a one way street!
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Just drop me off.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Not for years.
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Switch the charts.
What?
Love.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You saved my life.
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
Arf... You gotta help me.
I can't promise you anything.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
I have no idea.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
This would be it?
Never heard of him.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Who are you, Jerry?
That was him.
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He was murdered.
Not this again.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Thanks.
Not today.
This way.
What's in Connecticut?
Come on.
Is that what they told you?
Did you kill my father?
I don't understand.
Then tell me what happened.
Because he believed me.
You do?
I'm sorry.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Without a love of my own.
Where are you?
I can't promise you anything.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Now she tells me.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm leaning toward no.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
A dog bit it.
Excuse me?
You've asked me that one three times.
And what did I say?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
I don't understand.
Night after that?
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Agent Lowry?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Wasn't my idea.
Jonas?
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?
That you come with me.
I don't think so.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
No, thanks.
Oh?  How's he doing?
No doubt.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
Ellie.
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
No primer.
How can that be?
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
This is how you see the sky?
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
I can't move any smaller.
But what do I say?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
The librarian... or the library...?
Now... you go home.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Mmm.  Look closer.
Peter Valerian.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Like it.  Almost there.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Make that two.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Yes.  Very much.
Prove it.
I don't think so.
The final countdown.
Oh.  I brought you something.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
What are you so afraid of?
Hi.
It was quite a page turner.
I do.
What is it?
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Cut that backsass!
Buck is a deal.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
That's good: he earned it.
You steal a car?
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
You don't know!
Git to work!
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
You jes' watch us!
Pair'a nines.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
'Bout two hours left.
What happened? How far did you get?
Get away!
He's gonna be awright.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Well, whatta we got here?
I just always did like truck rides.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
On my own.
Thass right. Just play it...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Oh mah baby Luke.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
Kick a buck.
What are you talking about?
Only kidding!
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
The same as the first time...
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
She don't want it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Oh, I think you will.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
That's an opinion, not evidence...
Who?
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
For months... last October.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
How did you know they were stockings?
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
That's no surprise.
Then what do you need me for?
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
Because I'm all you've got.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.  I have to go...
She on the passenger side?
<u>What</u>?...
They all have one...
I know, baby.  I know.
Who prescribes the brandy?
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Just horseshit luck.
Classy madonna.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Tell it to your shrink.
My promise.
Helen Hudson...
Because I think I'm wrong.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Thank you.
What!? They brought the car here?
It is?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
Not yet. It's only beginning.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I can drive.
Yes.
It's hospital policy...
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I miss Beast a lot, too.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
There's nothing to tell.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
What about the engagement party?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Truly.
What's the matter?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
I ruined your wedding night.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Will you get time off to do that?
Come on.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Ruth's already taken him home.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
It's good exercise, Mom.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
There's a spider in my room.
That must be really difficult.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Who do you think you are?
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
I've already checked it out 17 times.
So are you engaged, or what?
Enough with the abracadabra.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Good God.
A small price.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
A rose is a rose.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
What's my rap?
What are the delusions like?
I wish I could have seen that.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Tell the doctor.
I don't like lamb.
Lie down.
I do.
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Home free.
Not a one.
So, it's over?
List schmist. You'll remember.
Open up.    I want to see.
You like it?
I love your apartment.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
It's sex time.
Shhhh.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You got wine. That's great.
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
I got worried. Are you OK?
Bingo.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
What?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
Michael, take it easy.
Silly, silly, silly.
And all the plans we have.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What do you want to do?
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, it's not like that.
Can you loan me a 20?
I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Especially now.
So, what do you say, Let?
So will you?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'll float you.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You killed her!
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
They left about a half hour ago.
I dunno.
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
Marcel?
Oui.
It's Daniel.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Why are you here?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Where are you from?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
What about the money?
And the Vodka.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I can't believe you didn't check.
We'll think of something.
I think he's already figured that out.
You're sure?
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Has to be.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What'd you get?
Does it really matter what I say?
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
A thousand dollars?
It's me.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
What'd they take?
Everything?
Everything.
Okay boss.
Great fuckin' song.
What room number?
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
You can use my car.
What is it you do, Sami?
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
I'm the driver.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
We both know I'm already dead.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Yeah, I can see that.
It's my idea.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No.   It's mine.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I know where she went.
What?
Where is it, Sophie?
Glenmorangie.
You wanna tell him?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
You got it in a bar?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
The lucky ones.
No.
Stick around and find out.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
A car.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'll go and make up his room!
I didn't have the heart.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
What's it to you?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
He is my defeated foe!
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
How so?
I'm bored.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
Kneel!
Never!
Jen!
Give it back!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
It is trouble for me.
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
But something is going on at the Yu household.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No, not yet...
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
She needs direction... and training.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
We must avenge mother!
What does it say?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Who ever made that.
No onions?
They make you fart.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
How 'bout the morgue?
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
It can't rain all the time.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Mister Funboy.
I have to go.
A remembrance.  A closure.
She's still dead.
Mom tried to cook.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Take the dope, too.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Another jolly nickname?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Miss her?
Leave me alone -- !
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
18k.  Crap.
...necklace... pearls...
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Is he inside?
Move in, guys.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
I'll be fine.
You heard me.
You what?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
On my mother's life.
Why not?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You talking to me?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
You've read The Fountainhead?
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Give me the fucking letter.
Refreshing.
You implied it.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It's my house.
How are you today?
Give it up.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
Doing what?
How was your date?
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
You're not gonna start that again.
What?
Lighten up.
Not at all. Have a seat.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Because I'm in love with you.
Why can't we be together?
Where are you going?
Get off me.
Hi.
Hi.
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
German.
The football stud?
What do you mean?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
I don't know.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
It's Kathryn.
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
I don't know.
Well what then?
Well did you like it?
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
That's one way of looking at it.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
But I thought high school is only four years.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
He'll love it.
Just taking your photo.
I look terrible.
I want to go home.
I was just kidding.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
Some other time, Cecile.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Is it me?
No, you were fine.
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
No.
Good night Cecile.
Prude.
Yummy.
Would you please leave.
Honey, is something wrong?
Baby?  Right on time.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
I'll be in touch.
Who is this?
Where is she?!
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald?
Yeah?
It's Kathryn.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
I'm working on it.
Blow me.
Call me later.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Take a look for yourself.
Yeah.
Nothing.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Exactly the opposite.
So what went wrong?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
It was... Fantastic.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Excuse me?
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
And I don't.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
I've never done this before.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Will you calm down?
Fine! Get off me!
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Didn't you hear what I said?
What about her?
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I need to talk to Annette.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
I did?
We played backgammon?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Did she show up?
She really loves me.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
You bastard!
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Yes, darling.
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
At the old house with the voice.
Do you know the people?
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
It's early yet.
What do you mean?
You're shouting at me.
What?
It's your play.
Well, you know where it is.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
I live right here.
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
Certain wishes do.
It was just a voice.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Yes, Amy?
She's there whenever I call her!
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
I can not tell you.
Will you be friend for always?
I shall want you for always.
Whenever you want.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
But you must!
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
But she's dead!
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
But why?
That's a fine-looking ring.
A lady threw it to me.
Soon as I finish.
But what happened to the little deer?
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
Yes, yes -
Good night...Barbara...
Now, I don't know Amy --
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
She pleaded so to do it
So do I, Mr. Reed.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Can we get some service here?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yeah but they looked cool...
I've been working out.
I mean where on your body?
Oh, on my wrist.
Good. Except for PMS.
No it's mom.
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Only to see.
Can't you get contacts?
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Why would they exaggerate?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No, did you fuck him?
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And my bra finally fits again.
I wonder if he's married.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I think he called you beautiful.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh no.
Okay, I gotta go.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Why not? There's been a murder.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
I could smell another woman on him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
Ignore it.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
I think I already have.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
About Benito.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Frida? You okay?
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
Starving.
That's great. Highly original.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
I didn't have to pee then.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You don't have to pee.
Yes I do have to pee!
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I can't help it, it smells so good.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Yeah right... You better go.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn't a good time.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
Take your shower.
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
Your desk.
Did you change your hair?
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
No?
Are you following me?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
What's that supposed to mean?
I love you too.
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Peter I love you too but...
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Thanks.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, I have a cat.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
You can't believe this bullshit.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
We can just take this pillowcase.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
This one walk you home too?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
His wife.
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
He tried to kill me!
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
Just visiting my patient.
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Just like that?
Yes.  This way.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Sorry, sir.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Wrong?  Look at this!
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Iím sorry...
Shut-up.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Who?
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What is that door?
Which one?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
Wait, this isn't fair...
You seem restless.
Then we must call the police.
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
Shut up!
Please...
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Right.
What?
No more than the usual.
You're kidding?
Don't worry about it.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
What the hell is this ?
No...
Great.
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Yeah.
Fine...
Fine.
I don't give a shit.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Exactly. A condition.
Yes.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Check his kids.
Clean.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
Sort of... Yeah.
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
I am the government.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Well -- take care.
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
Really?   Crazy?
I see what you mean.
What?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
What?
We vetoed that?
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Alan...
She knows.
Does it make the cars any better?
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Ah.
What do you mean?
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
No.
Oh.
Of course.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
No... They don't kid.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
The Vice-President...
Well...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
I'm outta here.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
You made their funding disappear!
You weren't in the state legislature.
You1re leaving, too?
Truman used it all the time.
Thanks.
What?
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
It was inspirational.
Yeah... Bedtime.
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
I know.
I missed...
... Me, too.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Yeah... It could be fun.
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
Fabulous.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
The tunnel.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
What?
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
You are dying, too.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
In the battle, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Don't come.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I don't think they're in school.
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
It will?  How do you figure?
But why?
Well?
So?
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
This is it.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I couldn't stop myself.
I think you're sweet.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
I'm in.
It's Nuwanda.
What happened?
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
It's better than doing nothing.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
It does?  What?
You know,
Stop what?
Chet...
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
My Word
It's just for a little while. You promised.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Very good, Mr._?
Meeks.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A barbaric yawp.
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
I don't know.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
I'm calling her!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
But different.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is it?
The god of the cave.
My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Nothing.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
I don't want to read.
Found what?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Quiet.  I have to think.
It's my birthday.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Oh. 
I will be with thee straight.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Yea, art thou there?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
He's the owner...
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
And where is our point of arrival?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
Then you better start swimming.
Shut up!
I told you...
With who?
That's where my boat's moored.
It ain't any better out there!
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
I'm their ride.
What are you people talking about?
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
I don't know...
I'm not rich people.
Thank you, I work at it...
Seen a lot of islands?
Quite a few.
Self sufficient...
The "come back" kind.
How do you know that?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
The quiet...
A meat locker.
Yeah...
And what if I run into one of those things?
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
I don't take orders at all.
This time, make an exception.
He's not coming...
You ain't giving the orders here!
Forget them...
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I'm stuck...
I don't know...you got what we need?
That way.
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where is everybody?
You want some too?
Plans don't change...
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
Hey! Come out here!
I'm looking...
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
She fucked me too.
I know...
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Damn right!

Where? Where is he?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
But you must come in.
But I insist.
I have to go.
You are frightened, no?

Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?

Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --

Too bad.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Now he's back.
Inside, Vince.
No?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Nick, she won't say why.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Here.
You Biederman?
Biederman, yes.
Linda, what's the matter?
Oh... You know...
What?
Would you?
I don't know! I don't know either!
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Right here.
You're going hunting?
What?
I don't know.
We... Three bullets.
And then you...
Who the hell knows!
No. No, no.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
That way it sets.
You do?
Yeah.
What do you think about?
Pow.
Pow?
Pow.
Oh.
Well, where's he from?
Yeah.
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I'm doing that too.
What do you mean?
Three bullets -- minimum.
No way. No fucking way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Watch it, shithead!
Here! This is it!
No!!!?
No.
That's it. No. No way.
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?

John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Listen, Nick --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
Here. Behind you.
Aw, it's a long story!
No!
Never one.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Up ribbon!
Down ribbon!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I want this bastard brought down.
Wade's here.
I'd think about it.
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I want to see my wife and kid.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
When you bring in Doucet.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
Out of the room.
And I want Doucet.
What are you talking about?
He could be brought back.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
How do I look?
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Go in the house.
Ooops, I forgot.
But Sergeant...
How do you know?
Some things never change.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Thanks.
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
How do I look?
Not too good.
You treat her nice.
...What are you talking about...?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
I'm signing off.
And you should be with your family.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
What's it mean?
Take a look at this.
Yeah.
Seat's too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Good to know you, Willy.
You could always take it off.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Thank you, Belle --
It hasn't opened yet?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
No! No! I won't.
Howdy, Hank.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
-- in gold.
Where's everybody?
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
You are afraid!
Afraid ... of what?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Look here now--
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Ten throws it is.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Headache -- Squire?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Coming.
Yep.
We can still use my butter money.
Not all of it?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Worried!
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez --
Thanks, Mary.
I'm serious.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
It shows on your face.
I don't know, Jabez.
Mary! Come back ...
Mary!
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
All right, son -- if it helps.
I dunno.
What's that you say, Son?
I say -- it don't matter.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Coming, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
I'll do my best, Mary.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
You can talk to me ...
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
So, you divorced of what?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
So, why didn't you come?
Mind if I play some tunes?
That is Christmas music.
No, sir.
John.
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
Who are you, then?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
Only if New Jersey counts.
Put it down now.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Uh, what do I call you?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
You don't want to know.
I still feel like shit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Yessir.
Come on, what's under this?
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Ooohh....
Yeah.  So how are you?
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Where you gonna go?
I like that... yeah!
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
You don't have a choice?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Are they on the phone still?
Well, then...
It's my only chance!
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
What do you want to know that for?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
What do you want?
The girl hostages.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Don't fuck with me ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
I can take care of that.
Come on, lemme load you up...
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
If you take anybody, please take me.
They look like good kids.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
No you don't.
Why not?
I don't think so.
Yeah?
What now, Sonny?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
I'm glad it's okay.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You were terrific, too!
Hey.  It's raining.
Did you always call him Junior.
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
Let's go, Sonny.
Get 'em in the vault!
How'd that happen?
What?
I want him to think that.
But I want to know what you think.
Dead or alive?
Alive.
All right ... let's go.
Does that still go?
We're not there yet.

We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
Gotcha.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Coming.
Okay, what?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Well la de da.
I don't follow.
I know I am, Mom.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
So boys, how was your first day?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school? What's that?
Is that what I think it is?
No, it's a treasure map.
You're it.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
The principal.
Wow.
The second R is silent.
Oh, of course.
Go fish.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Exactly! A pirate!
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
They can't be real.
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
Wanna bet?
Who's your partner?
You can't marry my mom.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
You're always your harshest critic.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY!
Go away, assface.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Me, me, me!
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
A blimp.
Who?
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
I know I did.
Sorry, no further questions.
Am not.
Are, too.
D2.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Roger that, Wilco.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Damn! What are the odds?
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
Hey, where'd you go?
I know.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Oh I think you do.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Oh, go on.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Looks like the best man won.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Can you believe it?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
That's the downside. There is none.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Hey can be on top?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Yes you are. 
And I you.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Oh wow. Look at you.
Wow, you are smart.
And you are great in bed.
Who's there?
It's a surprise.
Just like the President.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Are you going to kill her?
Piter.
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
With your permission...
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Sire!
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Not sorry enough.
Let him stand free!
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Excellent!
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Yes...
Always.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
SILENCE... SILENCE.
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
I'd know the difference.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
I didn't feel well...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Nah.  This happens all the time...
I never said I could ad-lib...
So how'd we do?
We didn't make a dime.
Mmph?  Where am I?
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Yeah, I did.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
I was thinking about killing myself.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
No problem.  I know it by heart...
If you say so.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
Sound!
What do you mean?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
Edward Wood, Sir.
I don't understand.
We'll do our best.
No!  A horror movie star!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
You met Basil Rathbone!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
This is my way of telling you --
Oh, just like in the script!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
But you used to say --
I understand you just moved here?
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Hruphh...?
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
Yes?
Oh, of course!
Tor!
I think you're quite handsome.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
We're escaping!
Yes?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
Isn't he dead?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
I got married last night.
Oh.  My condolences.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
I just picked them up on the way over...
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
Okay?
STOP!
Bela died.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
My chiropractor!
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Huh?!
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
What's uncanny?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if I'm vomiting?
Do they show it?
Al!
What?!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yes?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Al!
We're falling behind.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
He made a mistake.
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
He says --
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
Mom?
St. Joseph's.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Shari, Ray feels --
She wouldn't tell me.
Our foibles, our foibles!
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
Welcome to work, Ed.
So?
Okay ...
Yeah.
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
Go!
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
What?
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Look at this.
Ed?
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Come on...
No. It's your fault.
Where were you?
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
We're excited.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's me, Ed.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
You brought the girl!
Yeah.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
Ray, come an--
Who's Shari?
Who's --
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
The pirate ship.
What?... Why?
Hi.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Mm.
Ed?
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
pierde.
He likes it.
What?
All right.  I'll be back
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Yeah?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Tracy.
Ethics are...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Here they are.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Hello, Tracy.
I'm looking at new cars.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
My house.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
I hope so
You will.
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
Hmm?
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Exactly when?
Which door?
I have proof.
More this way.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yep.
Three twenty-five.
Sherry... I love you.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
I'm not like you.
What?
Well, I do.
Sorry.
I mean at you.
For what?
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
What do you mean?
Hell, good luck!
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
Don't you fucking knock?
What'd I do?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
What's it to you?
That obvious, huh?
It's not what you think.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
When they deserve it.
But you did it anyway.
Yeah.  But not for long.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
In the morning.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
Of course... But how?
How what, Wendell?
You've got it, Wendell.
I got to write my report first.
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Yeah.  A great big one.
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Lynn.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
What about him?
I'm not asking you.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Against your code?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
More or less.
Nothing.
Say what and so what.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I don't own no shotguns.
What does that have to do --
And what?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Answer yes or no.
I... No.
So be it.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
I'll break them, sir.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Something like that.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
That's right.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Glasses.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Yeah.  My whole life.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
I want to do it right.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
You, me and White, huh?
None.  Call it a hunch.
A sweet man.
Under the house.
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Down around my ankles.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
What's wrong, Trash?
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
It'll be our secret.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Working whores with squad two.
Oh Jesus.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
<u>They</u> said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Clear as day.
Who else have you told?
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Be careful, Danny.
I don't know who he is.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
What do they have to do with this?
The NSA?
Yes.
You're crazy.
Wait.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
No shit.
I'll pay you.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
Look, my wife is understandably--
What'd I tell you?
I called from a payphone!
You told me no calls.
None of your business.
Looks like Detroit.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Where?
<u>Here</u>?!
You sure?
You're driving.
Those are Feds.
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell me about it.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
What if <u>what</u>?
No.
Who?
Not particularly, no.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Who's calling?
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You got any money?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
Very good.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Eight.  Size eight.
Remain calm.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>What's</u> your point.
The robbery.
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
About the accident.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
I can't.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Because I don't know.
Somebody took my blender.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
To buy lingerie.
For your wife?
Listen to him.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Sorry.
It's okay.
He's got his priorities?
Leave this house.
Was that doctored-up, too?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Well...yeah.
Good.
Stacy--
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
I was missing you.
Oh Christ.
That's gonna end tonight.
It's over.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
It's a brand new card.
Here, you can use this.
Sir?
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
It's not?
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
It tastes like fish.
Not that much.
Brill.
Never.
Yes.
Other than me.
Why would I--
Eat your fish.
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I'm gonna fix it.
You have to.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
This conversation's over.
What makes you think it's you?
We believe he did.
You're wrong.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
Gimme the shoe.
You're Brill.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Where's Stacy?
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Can I open 'em up?
Really?
Dad!
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Where've you been?
No "900" numbers.
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
No, but they took my blender.
Serve the ball.
He's heard that it's escalated.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
They're framing me.
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
You're tired.
Listen to me.
You gotta--
I have a family.
So do I!
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
Go fuck yourself.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, what's going on?
What does that have to do with you?
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
It means who's side are you on?
What?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
Get it.
Help from whom?  Christ.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
No sir.
Dean's with Lyle.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
We don't know.
Explain that.
Federal Express?
How'd you get in the building?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Yes sir.
Hello!  Good morning.
Excuse me?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
That insults them.
Pardon?
I do not.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No, but I think I do.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
You don't sew at all!
A lie.  What do you hate most?
What?  No!
It's a folk song.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
No.
A surprise, he said.
We've got to get you out of here.
Oh dear.
I know.
Still a car.
You too.  Good luck!
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
What did you do?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
May God make safety your companion.
Okay.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
No.
I don't know.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Or was it Toronto?
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
So was my Patient.
Where've you been?
Rabbit hunting.
Ask him.
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
I can get in the back.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
For?
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
The rest meant nothing to me.
No, now I can't kill you.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Aren't you?
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Yes.  Dropping off.
How?  How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I have a cigarette?
Are you crazy?
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Thank you.  Thank you.
Really?  That's sudden.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Kip's another one.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
- to her cooking.
Would you like me to?
Never heard of it.
I don't think so.
Yes, for your hair.
You get Hardy.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
Nya-nya-nya!
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
Kip… I -
When he dies I'll catch up.
And what if he really is a spy?
No.  He's - no.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Hello miss.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
We can do that when we're very, very old.
A bit of one.
I had a hotel room.
Yessir.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
What's he saying?
Or my wife's.
Then you were married?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
The windows don't open.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Why didn't I think of that?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
I'm in the middle.
Who am I?
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
I can't?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
Uh, yes.
I'll call an ambulance.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I sincerely hope so.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
No. Why would I be?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Oh?
Possibly.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
Not a word.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
Give him the card.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
Where's my bag?
What's my problem? You want a list?
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
Nice spot.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
That's because I wanted them to!
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
We are...for the tools.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Our equipment has arrived.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Charged?
Thank you.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Ready.
Behind you.
Shut up.
The Mask.
Yes. Yes.
The big job.
There is no big job.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
I'd taken the Mask?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
You've thought of everything.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Parachute.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
There is one more thing.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
That's because you grew up rich.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
FUCKING THING!!!
The disc is still in there.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
I sincerely hope not.
No way.
Go!
Get out of here!
You mean the seven billion.
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
The key to success is using the right tools.
It's never big enough.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
Because it pays off.
You change partners, you change the rules.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Check out my ball.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
To yourself, that's where.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Call it an expression of trust.
Thought you had to use some of these.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
That's a joke, right?
What do you think?  What's this?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
It's those files you asked for.
All of them.
There's more than one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Yes?
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
The what?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Five million dollars.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Excuse me?
Lemme see it, will you?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
That's crazy -- why not?
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
No --
Really?  It makes me sick.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
What?  Who?
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
So what are you thinking?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Gee, I wonder why.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Uh-huh.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin --
Say you were wrong.
I was wrong.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Take it.
Corey.
Good.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I guess I did.
Not anymore.
There's more than one kind?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
George!
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
PG& -- Are you sure?
In the conference --
When?
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
I do.
You got more than one?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Better safe than sorry.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
Lock the door.
No, I wanna say hi.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
What's that?
I need it.
Mm-hm.
That's okay.  I understand.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Have you been logging on?
Yeah.  Who are you?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Next week.
Wow, that's soon --
Yes?
The Emperor?
Come in, Admiral.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
No ... there is another.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Barks and growls at his boss.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
What happened?
Howls.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Sit down, and shut up!
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Yes.
Not you?
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
That should do nicely.
How do I look?
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Why?
Try and control this ...
The entrance is collapsing!
Here ... near the Anoat system.
You look silly.
You look great.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Are you kidding?
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
We have no use for your kind.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
What?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Are the coordinates set?
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Closer?!
Oh my, no!
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
I've never seen it fail.
You are reckless!
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
My mind fills with so many images.
It is the future you see.
If it must be.  Yes.
That won't be necessary.
It won't get through the blockade.
I want that ship.
They suggested oranges.
A display of primitive apparatus --
They look pretty docile.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
I like you.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
What?
He's... near.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
I got a new deal for you.
Say goodnight, Carjack.
Somebody get off!
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
No.
Good.
Lock fuel rods.
Locked.
So where's Plissken?
No way.
I said pull over.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
We'll see.
Don't like it, don't come.
Looking to get out.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Like hell I do.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You're running out of time.
Give me the prototype.
I'm looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Yeah.
I will not.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
It is deep...
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
That's not why you came.
In the great book.
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Well hurry then, and get it.
You, my lord.
Why?
Who?!
You.
Me?
Love demands it.
He has given up.
I will run.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
Why?
I am the desert, where water disappears--
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
You didn't ask!
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
No, he's working on another book.
In here!
And you got an invitation.
Didn't who tell me?
I can't believe it.
Phonograph.
Storage.
Me too.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Want to ask him?
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
I just heard them Karl.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
She is going to be well?
What!
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
That's good.
Yes, I think so.
It affects concentration.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Please go away.
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
About my daughter?
No.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
On what?
The priest.
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
It's not important good night.
Please.
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
What kind of stuff?
You like it?
I found it.
Where?
You know how?
Here I'll show you.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
He's nice.
Here I'll show you.
You think?
Cause I like it.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
I don't know, I just thought.
How do you know?
Honey it's to help you.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
I stole it.
I believe you.
Stealing is a sin.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
Withering Heights.
Who's in it?
Another one. Had your lunch?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
You and Regan?
You and us.
Uh Huh.
Ego te abslovo.
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Merrin! Merrin!
How's your leg?
Last month.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Her heart.
She'll go into coma.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
I could have you deported, you know that?
Are you tired?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...Be gone!!
...from this creature of God!!!
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
Mondays.
Your pay.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Swimming trunks.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Just the same.
Suit yourself.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Baker.
They're falling out.
How many?
No bones.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
My brother and I. One each.
Recognize these two characters?
Two nights.
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Like an angel.
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
You're their uncle.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Try the black Knable.
Thanks.
Really.  You sleeping?
Seeing anyone in particular?
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, I mean it.
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
What do you mean?
Her hands.  Like that.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's me.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
What're you talking about?
What?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
All right.  What's your name?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I didn't get her number.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
Here, how's this?
How about these?
You wanna get a drink?
Yeah, fine.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
So what do you think?
Day.  Wednesday.
Last?
Sunday.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, you take the right.
Yeah.
Why would I mind?
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Fine.
Time flies, huh?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
February?
April.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Some disease.
I don't know.
Seventy-one
Shut up, Frank.
No.
Good choice.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah?
So what'd you think?
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, we're not.  Jack?
All right.
The flu.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
This is where the auditions were.
We're finished.
What about me?
My watch is broken, too.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
So run a little longer.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
That's the premise.
When we know.
We're a team.  We work together.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What-?
What's he talking about?
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Big feet.
Uh... good.
Right.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Piece of cake.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Did you hear it?
Hey!
Virgins?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
Great.
Great?
Tell her.
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Gotta go.
How come?
Job.
Funny job.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Come on, Ed.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Right.  In there.
The name's Baker --
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Is that the way it is?
It's been a long time, Ma.
Not for money. With my mother.
His kid's sick.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Nothing personal --
Aren't the kids asleep?
Every year.
Can't sleep?
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
It's a shitty  song.
Better than that.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend.
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap?
You sending me home?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Coffee?
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Huh?
Vegetables.
Hi.
Losing his teeth.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
Looks old.
Older than me.
Ever go to church?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Yeah?
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you, Ma.
Fine.  You?
Oh, fine.
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
He hit a guard.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Drive.
My place.
Should be.  It's yours.
Shut up.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I'm late for surgery.
It's important.
Something good?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
How come?
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
What more proof do you need?
Damn right.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Not anymore.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Shoot him!
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
When did you start smoking?
I mean like protection.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Get rid of them.
The Admiral?
Castor's escaped!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What do you know about it?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
I’m sure you do...
What about me?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
I don’t know...
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I think I could figure it out.
Big Ed’s.
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Trouble at work?
It’s not Kate, is it?
She is relentless.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
How’d you know my name?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
What the hell is happening to me?!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
It’s lovely...
Need a nurse?
You’re a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
It would help me if we were.
Thanks.  To you too...
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
You hear me complaining about that?
Yeah...fine.
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because that’s where I live.
Jack...don’t even start...
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
You’re kidding me...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
She got those shoes...
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
I want it...
It’s good, right?
What...?
Then say it...just say it to me...!
No, open it...
Now...I don’t...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
It’s like a museum.
For the week?
A perk for what?
You’ve been Jack Campbell.  And that’s always a good thing...
Promise me again...
That’s the one...
You’re not married, are you?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Aspen.
Not by a long shot.
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
No...I’m not...
Last night was great...
I'd like that, too.
So we'll get egg nog.
I've got plenty of places to go.
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
I'm worried about you.
About me?  How sweet.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
Ben!  Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
But all these people...
So are you!
Last one down springs for room service.
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Dude.  That's my sister.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Reed, we're running out of time.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Yes, thanks.
Passion.
What?  What do you mean you --
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Just <u>find</u> him.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
Medical's ready.
Phase Two.
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
The Other Side got to him.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Say that again?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Yes?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
Yes, Cora.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You may learn to like it.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
And if it should take more time to get through --
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
I feel much better now...
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
What gives you that idea?
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
It's too late now. We must go on.
Nothing -- against all that force.
You left something out.
What's that?
The Breath of God...
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
How are you, Miss Peterson?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Where we going?
Go ahead.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
I could use a lawnmower...
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
I'll do what I can.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?

Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.

Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
You haven't been going to yours.
It's for men.
Like testicular cancer?
So you're staying in tonight?

That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Is that what you're calling it?
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
What... ?
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Don't ask.
Who's this?
Tyler?
Who's this?
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
... You know me?
Yes... it's a test.
Is this part of the test?
What do you want me to do?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
Yeah.
Can I stay at your place?
Thank you.

No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
You get the idea.
Where do you want it?  In the face?

What is it?
Imagine how he feels.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
... is over.
... is over.
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
I don't know!  Tell me!
What are you talking about... ?
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
You took me to the house.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Um, well... technically, no.
I can't let you...
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
Stop finishing...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
What?
Defuse the bomb.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
What?
Not exactly according to plan.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why what?
I'm doing this for us.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will.  You know you will.
What have you left for me?
It's the only way to get rid of you...
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
What?
Maintenance.
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
Did you hear what I just said?!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Let go of me!!
Why?
No, please, no, God, no!
I have to save Eugene!
She had the baby?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
No.  What's this about?
Take a guess.
...My Premonition was just like his.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
Who is this guy, anyway?
How do you know?
I wasn't worried about us.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
No, I'm good.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.

Let us out!
Easy, Billy, just open it.
No! No! Don't!
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
No harm. No foul.
No one's that strong.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
What just happened?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
That's what I'm here for.
Read you.

How?
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Sorry, Sir.
Not yet.

Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Colonel.
That's it.  My life.
Those men are all dead.
Yeah.  Big time.
What did you want?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Do I look like I have someone special?
Meeting ... people.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Yeah!

Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Serveza yourself!
You know what, you are never satisfied.
You got another ball comin'.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You treat me like I was.
I love it.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
What?
Just finish eating.
Fill it up.

Are you talking to us?
Hi, Tita.

No kidding.
Very nice.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Daddy's very ill.
He's had two strokes.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
It's not that bad.
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
With applesauce?
No, thanks...
My turn.
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, Robert.
That's dangerous, you know.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
You had no inner feeling?
I think it's what you think.
No, it isn't what I think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Yes, that's what's important to me...
Shut up...
That's right.
I don't believe vou.
Something witty and devastating like that.
What?
I'll be back later...
What?! I can't hear you!
Just give me a chance, will you?
All right, let's have a rematch.
It is true.
Besides being very rude.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Jesus, what a rude person...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Perhaps...
Yes.
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Look at me.

I'm a good friend of hers.
How do I know you're not lying.
Nothing.
Hey!

Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I have no idea.
I wasn't asking.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Full name.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Ask anybody.
That a boy.
Thank God, the police.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
We play tennis at the club.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Two bs?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
For sure?
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
What, the heat here?
Right. Fine.
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Thank you.
That's it.
He'll be so relieved.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Wait a second --
Since he moved to L.A.
Right.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
They bust you every week.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Yeah. Maybe.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Alan Stanwyk.
Charmed.
I'm all ears.
I have the same problem with my help.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Sure, all drifters do.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Only one way to find out.
Nothing to it.
I'm sorry?
How long have they been married?
John! You used to fly together!
John Ultrarelamensky.
That's a strange combination.
So were my parents.
I love the outfits.
See what I mean?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
Hi.
You ordered it here?
Here, take mine.
God...
I saved his life during the war.
You were in the war?
Depends on the question.
What is this?
Long story.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
That's what I want to know.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
They're trying to kill me!
Come here.
You shouldn't be here.
I want to hear this.
They just left, sir.
In her cabana, sir.
One.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Sierra del fuego.
No wonder.
Moved out.
She moved out?
Tell the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Irwin...
Looks great.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
I'd say charcoal.
I have some ideas.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
I want something I can print!
What?  Who the hell are they?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
I was upset.

But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...

I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Oh... I have some questions.
Nuthin'.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Thanks, I needed that.
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Make eye contact when you say that.
I like.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?

You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
There's that question...
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
What's fine?
I'm off it!
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.

You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
You're shitting me!
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
I should'a been a fucking mailman.
I'm alright, Gibby.
Don't know what's behind it.
One way to find out.
Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
The usual.
Did he?
He did.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
You give him his drops?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you more.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
So am I.
Frank...
Luck, my ass.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Glad to hear that.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Wait...
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Oh, that was my kid.
29-years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What?
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Yeah...I think so.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
But you're not...you're not still here.
I lost you.
What?
Fire.
On the job?
October 12, 1969.
Yeah, it's me.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Yeah, you betcha.
I'm right here, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
What the hell is that smell?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Better.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Whoa, I just...I just...
Which means he probably knew her.
What?
Yeah.  Sure.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
I try to be.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  What house you work?
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
Going?  How do you mean?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Where's Shelly?
I'll think of something.
I vote for the hammock.
I love you, man!
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
Don't do that to me!
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
Your bed.
A hammock?
Why?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Nothing.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Are you all right, Shelly?
What do you mean?
You promised you'd never ask me.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Sort of.
You're Shelly?
I'm sorry.
In that little thing?
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Gulp!
Keep looking.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
You don't "have to."
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
We're gonna scare him?!
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Better call an ambulance first.
I wish it was.
Happy Friday the 13th.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Wait a minute. I just...
Did you hear me?!
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
That's debatable.
Boy scouting.
You gotta be kidding!
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
I'm here.
Yes.
I need to talk to you.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Twenty.
Look --
I know everything about you, Diana.
That's it, we're done.
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Not so bad, today.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
N...nothing.
So's he and he knows it.
Good night, beautiful.
'Night, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
That's what I'd like to know.
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Sorry.
Her name's Stephanie.
She's yours?
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Next, you dial a number.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I've told you the truth.
You don't know shit!
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Hear what?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
It's...dead.
The fire alarm...
Don't be ridiculous!
I packed it. Just for us.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I gathered that.
I...I don't know...
Hi, Sean.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Where you're going, mister?
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Very bad today.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Alla puttanesca.
Quietly effective.
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
Don't talk like that.
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Asbestos lining.
Do not inhale.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
What happened eighteen months ago?
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
Do we care?
I say we go.
You say we go?
Do not inhale.
Here we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
What about the haircut?
He'll hate it.
Paisley Porter.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
Unbelievable.
Classic.
What are we talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She's dying.
She died.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
The Red Sox
We're able to surprise each other.
In and out of bed.
They'll lose because they're my team.
He will absolutely hate it.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Do you want to get some coffee?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Why do you need a radio?
Is it?
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
It's only our first date.
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
A flat-out hit.
Mystery. Deception.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
And you've been extremely patient.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Alma Wetzel.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It violates so many trusts.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.
One more out.
A thousand things.
You're hurting my head.
This could be it!
Life is real.
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
Right here. At the door.
It's me. Nicky.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I can't find it.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
How come you got the kid with you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
That's a simple subject.
You're charming the boy.
It's a simple subject.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Life is good.
Matthew.
Because life is good.
Because faith is rewarded.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
They're my team.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Eleventh inning. What else?
Sidney.
I was educated by nuns.
I think I remember.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
Say it again.
You know what.
Alla puttanesca.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Would you like to meet him?
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Is what true?
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
No one's waiting.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Never mind.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I'm going home to my machine.
It is the work of untouchables.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
One more.
Going nearer to God!
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
He said he's in charge...
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We must end the campaign.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
There is nothing I can give.
It's split the Government.
Well, that's one victory.
I dined at the prison.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Something's not right.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Where do we start?
Where did you get this?
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
He's too tall.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
The Mission Director.
You wish.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
You know I'm scared of heights.
It's okay, Eugene.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
They think I offed the Director.
They found my eyelash.
In a corridor.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I'm sure I could have.
If you say so.  The stripe.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
I was never very good at it, remember?
Not bad, Jerome.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I'm travelling too.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
I've found him too.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Yes.
Why would we do that?
We were just looking.
I know about you.
Does it have a name?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You're angry--
You'll be next.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
Who are they?
Come on.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
We could go together one day.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
New policy.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Beynon.
And you got him...
That's right.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
You okay?
Yeah.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Good.
What do you want for dinner?
Just the way I remembered.
That's not all of it.
No. It's been a long time.
It's all right.
It's just been a while.
Really.
Better than I remembered.
Is he straight?
I couldn't have... much longer.
Yeah... I know.
I didn't. I just waited.
Want to cry now?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
My mind's not on guessing games.
I mean it.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
I see it...
Do it my way.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
She's on TV.
We keep going.
He must have.
Fifteen minutes.
Sure?
I can handle it.
I'll bet you can.
I mean it.
I didn't mean police.
When are you going to learn?
I did I killed a man.
Let's do it.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
Not now.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I don't want to hear it.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
Whatever happens it's over.
Things can't get much worse can they?
You and me.
Can we make it?
Yeah.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Who was it?
Just get your clothes on...
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
We walk.
Yeah... I guess it does.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Might try that.
Chicago.
Yeah. I got out.
What do you have in mind?
Right.
Then you do it.
Can't leave the desk.
Suit yourself.
Where we go in1?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
Come on. How much?
'Bout five thousand.
Sure am.
That's what I want.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You can trust him...
How long have you been married?
Can he trust you?
I'll tell you when.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
How?
A couple of weeks back.
Nothing. What could I do?
What did he say?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Yeah.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
Well?
Christ, what...
Good evening.
Confidential, like.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I want to talk to you later.
Tomorrow morning, then?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Nicer than most.
Why'd you see him so regular?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I work for him.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
He was here for four days.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
We're there now.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Now you're asking.
You sure about that?
Sure I'm sure.
You've been watching the film.
Tell me about the girl.
Shouldn't think so.
Your brother? What you talking about?
And you didn't know her last name?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. It's all right.
I left last year.
Oh, what you doing now?
That must be interesting.
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Nobody seems to know.
Where would I find him?
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Large Scotch.
That's what he was saying about you.
Good lad.
Las Vegas.
Four of them.
How'd you find me?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
It never is.
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
It'll cost you.
You don't look it.
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No, you won't.
Ta-ra.
They came back?
No.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
You're a bastard.
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Think about it.
No.
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
I don't want to get rough, do I?
How could I stay away?
Jack Carter.
Eric. Eric Paice.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Still got your sense of humour.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
They do that up North.
What for? Protective purposes?
Knock it off, Gerald.
What? And get the clap?
That's right, Harry.
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
That's right.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
...Polacks...
Deadbeats all.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the...
I...I don't know.
Well, they fucked it up.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
It is.
Eh?
It's too...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not right.
No.
Eh...?
That's right?
Eh?
...cower in his boots...
He's doing very well.
Yes.
Starting up.
What hard part?
Just the act.
What act?
You...
You...
You build it!
That's what I...
Men come work for you...
They have...
When they...
Yes...?
How?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
Yes.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Hey.
Did you?
What did you say?
Have I said that?
What did he say?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
You.
I...
Yes.
What does that mean?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
Yes.  I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
Absolutely.
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
In the abstract...
Is that what I just said?
You need money?  Is that the...
Because you listened.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Huh?
They're ancient.
Clear...
It's a waste of time.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
They stole the...
To the cops?
Yeah.
A waste of time?  Why?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
No.
Where was I?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Thieves.
Why?
You think so?
Yes.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Will you excuse us please?
You understand?
Did they catch...?
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
That's great.
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery. 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Did they get my contracts?
...did they...
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Would you come in here, please?
...I only...
Under him?
Moss.
...let me...are you listening to me...?
John.  John...
I'm out.
Yes.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
What if you don't close...?
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now.  Yes...When?
Somebody broke in.
Get 'em to me!
Yes, I am.
No.  It hadn't.
You robbed the office.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Who kept the other half?
That was easy, wasn't it?
Was it?
Abso...
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
I'm sorry.
Why?
John: John:...my daughter...
Fuck you.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
And did they steal the contracts...?
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
That's right.
Shelly...!
Guess who?
From the store.
Fuck her...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
My wife told me to look into...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Go ahead.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Kenilworth.
Yeah.
Yes.
I don't know.
Yes.
Mmmm...
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
I don't understand.
I'm not.
If we wait till Mon...
When did you write the check?
What was yesterday?
Tuesday.
Tell me again.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No.  She told me "right now."
She won't listen.
What does that mean?
What...?
I...
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What, "this"?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Fuck the Machine.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You did that?
Guess who?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
They took 'em...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Your farewell to the troops?
They--excuse me...
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
I have the stuff from last year's...
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
Yes.
I got lots of presents.
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Will you take me?
I can't.
I can help you.
Some day you will.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Oh yes, the very best.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
How are the kids?
Bought at the airport.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
No, Dad.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
He will grow strong.
The child cannot harm you.
Let's go.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
I never met them.
That's what I'm here for.
Wait'll you see!
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
Beautiful.
Within the compound will be fine.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Am I a prisoner?
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
She's gone, Tom.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
If I'm wrong...
Wait... there's something else.
Mike, at three and a half...
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
Twenty-five this time.
Mike wants it.
No questions.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Is he related to the witness?
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
Yes, Michael, it does.
Goodbye, Michael.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Right here.
You said you were Klingman.
There are still things I have to do.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Not good.
He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
When do we talk?
After dinner.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
It's important.
Sitting right behind you.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
What if I say shove it?
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
I won't keep you another minute...
Just thinking out loud.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Sure.  I loved it.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
I'm not married.
Why?
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
He is dead now, twenty years.
Yes!  You know?
Well...no, not really --
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Mornin'.
And your name is --?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What?  Oh yes.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
It's new.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Go ahead.
This David's a friend?
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Why not?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Nothing would please me more.
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
Not at all.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
You are much too human.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
It's too tight.
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
Pray you, undo this button.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Goodbye, Hanna.
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
Yes?
Just go.  We can manage without you.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is beautiful.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Of course.  This afternoon.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
After you then.
Quite.
What rumors might those be?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Righto.  Let me see.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Is there someplace we can talk?
A boost. A big boost ...
Who do you think?
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I don't want him hurt...
I'm just here about my brother.
I knew you'd say that, too --
Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
One more night --
Get out --
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What do you mean -- ?
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's that?
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
You know my back.
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
You know my back.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
You betcha --
Castlebeck.

Good.

We're partners here --
Donny-nothin'!

That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
It's arright ...
Yeah...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
I think so too --
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
Remember who my brother is?
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
You, too, Ma...
What are you doing back?

Of course ...
I know, sir ...
Yes, sir -
You guys are through...
Whatcha got left ... ?
What do you say, Toby?,
Yeah... You want a ride...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno ...
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
What do you got ... ?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
Me.
You?
Me...
Shadow games ...
De nada ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
The era when crime didn't pay --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
I'm cool.
Come here -
What?
Come here -
I know. I've missed you, too
I know ...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
What for -- ?
Now, we go -
Run it...
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
We're going shopping -- !
For real?
Call 'em here -- ?
DO IT! NOW -- !
You look like you lost your sheep ...
Mitch.
On account of me.
And here I am...
Six or seven...
That what you want?
That's what I want ...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No ... ?
No ...
Oh, yeah.
I take out my slim-jim...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Now... I'm in ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
What about The Club ... ?
Let me worry about The Club ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Bench seats.
You remember Junie?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Are you considering a comeback tour?
No we don't -
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
She left...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
She soars -
Excuse me --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Shit all looks the same here --
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Anybody!  You understand?
I understand.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I'm in construction.
What are you gonna do?
What bag?
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
What did he say, exactly?
Just get me out.
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
I flushed it down the toilet.
I got seared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
I gotta talk to you.
Have a drink first.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Will you stop.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
We'll pick it up.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Suck my cock!
Oh, Morgan!
Watch what happens.
Stop crowdin the plate!
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
I don't know yet.
Next week.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
I don't know.
Gone.
What?
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Ah, history I think.
How you doin'?
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
How much money you got?
I told you, I just got change.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
I have about seventy-three...
Will you take a check?
Good, it was all right.
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
Building two.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
Fuck do you want?
What're those?
Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.
I happen to know so.
Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
An integer.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
You've heard of Albert Einstein?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
So who won the bet?
Good to see you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got your card.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Can we do it at my office?
It's on the college.
You too, Gerry.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
I live right around the corner.
I think so.
--And confuse him--
--Gerry--
Come in.
Sean...
Me too.
I don't know. India maybe.
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
Who is he?
You guys are fuckin' sick.
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
I go places, I interact.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
What did you think?
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Oh.
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe what mea--
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Why not?
Haven't called her.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
What did you think?
What did I think?
Not to me, they're not.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
I didn't want the job.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'll keep in touch.
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
What?
What?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Yes you were.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Not a chance.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
We'll do that.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
How the hell did you do that?
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Fine.
Just for fun?
I guess so.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Goodbye.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
People done it. If they could, we could.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
Gallon or two?
Short fella. Pale face.
Okay. Go on.
Sure, but what is this?
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Two.
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two and a half cents.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Got a warrant?
How many of you?
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
Crate fell on me.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Just around that next bend.
No. They wasn't people to write.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
Casy! What you doin' here?
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Take her with you!
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
California.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
No plants.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
No'm.
No--an' look what I got for you.
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sometimes they do.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
I'm ready.
Ya say we're acrost?
Look, Ma!
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.
When?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
They know he got hit in the face.
Good-by, Tommy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
There, them stripy ones.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
California, here we come!
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
We gonna stay, ain't we?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
We gonna take whatever they got.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Morning.
We can pick anything.
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
You're so funny...
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
Computer guy.
What?
Really...? So what?
Okay. See you later.
Really?
What do you want to do?
Then express yourself, Bob.
Overflowing with love.
It's nice to see you again.
What's your business?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, there's not much to tell.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
Bad television.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Seven it is.
I'll think about it.
Yes.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
Okay... Hold on...
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Get the fuck outta here.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
You never could have kept this from me.
That's probably a good idea.
I'm staying here.
What if I come back?
I just know.
Say more.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Mmm.
Morality.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Hard to get good help these days.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hey, Bob.
In Portugal, yes.
It was the PLO.
One cannot love and kill.
I love. I kill.
This?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
I'll pay.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
I've looked at it.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
It's a place where religious people--
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Yeah. I guess we did.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
As long as you had a good time.
That's too bad.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
How are you? How's business?
That's good.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You lived in Chicago?
When I was first married.
Just who's been laughing at who here?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You too.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Feel good?
Yeah.
Five years. My son was born here.
I am comfortable.
Annie!
One more time.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I brought it to you in the hospital.
What about him?
Yeah?
Fine!
Fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I don't care.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Did he mention it?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I said... I started.
My period.
When? Tonight?
Why should they?
How's everything?
Good.
Hi.
Go ahead...
Who's there?
Yes. We're suing.
All right. Speak to you then.
Hi.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Riding with Judith.
Tch. What are you --
The funeral's on Friday.
How's my pregnant chick!
I love you.
Do you? Do you really?
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I know. We miss you too.
Night.
Huh-huh. You?
Let's not talk about that now.
What do you mean?
Tubab means white man.
You want to take a walk with me?
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise.
You too, Diane.
- See, what you can do for him --...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
What?
Weekend after next...
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Yeah.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
You know, you're a good kid.
She's an editor.
It's never too soon to start.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
I just could never say it!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
How's Pilgrim doing?
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
We still have a way to go.
How much longer do you think?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
How long were you married?
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Cool?
Yeah, cool.
It's cool!
Don't move!
Hack the Planet!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Waste the dude.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Shh!
The sensitive type.
Super hero like even.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
...as they snoop onto us.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Difficulty rating?
Yeah?
Curtis.
Dead?
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Hmmm.
Thank you!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Give it up! Just give it up.
What's going on?
It nibbles. You see this?
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Think you can do better?
I'll give it a shot.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I said give me time.
He's not enrolled in this class.
I'm Crash Override.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It's too much machine for you.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Name your stakes.
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
And you have to smile.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Yeah.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
What?
You would have looked better.
Wanna go for a swim?
We caught 'em.
Good.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
Joey, Joey...
What? whatwhatwhat?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Hey, it's me.
Phreak?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Thank you.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
When did you find this out?
I'm not angry it's just
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
Look.
I don't know!
What does that mean?
We're trapped in this house.
Get back!
Brady!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Yes, sir.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Its too late.
You guys always look great.
How do you know their not?
Because the lights are all out.
I'm not calling the fire department.
About what?
Has he been prepped?
Outside.
Check him out.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Drive Carefully.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Like a real sister?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
In a second.
It was the nightmare man
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Oh Rachel!
No.
Come on.
Well try dammit!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Just do it.
Hi.
You won't look pushy.
Okay, bye.
Its not over yet.
Where are you going?
You look sharp. You understand?
No problem, Sheriff.
This is 132, over.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
What are we doing?
Why?
He's been here.
How do you know?
Least I'm not alone.
Dear God.
Be here in a minute.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Car trouble?
Sort of.
What's going on?
Now you understand?
Uh huh.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
What happened?
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
Sure.
Fun-ny. See you.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Behind that bush there.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I wasn't spooked.
He was watching me.
That's probably all he can do.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Yes, you can.
I want to stay here and watch this.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
He isn't a man.
You all right?
Sure...
Have a good time.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
What about the bogyman?
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
I promise.
Tommy, let me in!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
No! Do as I say.
She's washing her clothes.
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
I'm wasting time.
That's the idea. Here we are.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
I see.
What does that mean?
It means... I see.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Mm-mm!
Come in, come in.
I can't believe it!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
You want to see some?
Well, let's do it.
Look at this.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Okay.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Hmm?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh no.  Not at all.
It's terrific!
And it ruins everything else.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Let's take a look.
Hi.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
...with the affiliates.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, Elliot!
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
You're out looking here?
How about you?
Oh.  Well, I live--
Where are you headed?
Yeah, you would.
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
I'm...all right.
How-how's Frederick?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Bye.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Lee... uh...
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Is something wrong?
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Aren't they great?
I know!  I know!
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
I know.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
But, you got four children!
I want one with you.
I am glad to see you.
Oh, honey!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
No, thank you.
Absolutely.
Hmm?
Yeah.
They're in the basement.
I can't take this anymore.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Stop accusing me!
So you met somebody else?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
You know... 
Like-- 
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
I bumped into your...
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
I'm okay.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
I know...I know.
Very good.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Yeah?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
...you know?  I, uh...
Mh-hm.
That's a beauty!
Oh!
Well, then a third opinion.
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
...from Mavis, also.
No, no, we decided!
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Here.  Be careful with those.
Oh!
Oooo.
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
Easily.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
So what's new?
You got it.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
My--uh...
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yes, you do recall, right?
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it was.
...in a really horrible way.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Well, I hope you've changed.
I'm okay.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Just a few minutes ago.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Mmm, what?
I'm pregnant.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Oh...
Dad!
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Uh-huh.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
They're offering... 
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
I'm not.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...these guy'll back you up.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
What's up...?
...what a world.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
That's why my wife adores me.
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
Exactly.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
He is...?
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
...here's to child abuse!
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
Yes, I did.
....what...? 
Let the girl go.
For a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
Shut up, Starling...
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
You seen John Brigham...?
A fellow with five fingers.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I'm an orphan.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
You know it?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Well, perhaps sometime we...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
That, that was <u>business</u>...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I'll have them picked up.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
...yes, yes, yes...
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.... yes...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
What is that that smells so wonderful.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
...but will that satisfy you?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
<u>Yes</u>.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Then we cannot go.
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I know where he is.
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
The shape of a Three.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Hey, lost again.
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
It would seem.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
...yes...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
Your Secret admirer?
Goodnight.
That wants to be a Yes.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
Yeah. I guess I do.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
I think your condescension is even better.
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Do you really think I care?
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
Don't get cocky, girl.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
You did last night.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Oh yeah, that's it.
Don't think.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You goddamn bitch!
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Color me nauseous.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Heather.
Jealous much?
Yeah, I just got back.
Give it up girl!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Suicide is a private thing.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
I don't really like your friends either.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
That's good. Have you done this before?
Next channel, darling.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Remember he's left-handed.
Did not.
Did to.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
This knife is filthy.
I thought I...you..
Cool off, we're seniors.
Goddamn Geek!
I think so, man.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Come on through.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.

Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
I'm not hungry.

But she'll have no one to look after her!
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.

Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!

Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
That was what we were led to believe . . .
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Mummy!
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
What?
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Zero's a number right?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Eighty four.
But... I thought...
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
No please make yourself at home.
Music to my ears.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
The bathroom!  For two days?
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
How recently?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Were you in it?  In the war?
Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Said he's not an actor.
She can't quit.
What?
I... I saw him out the window.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Hello, Mister Wallace.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters don't have hormones?
I didn't ask him.
They're really white.
Whoa, check it out.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
-- institution.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
A sense of proportion.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Just show me the way.
Isn't that always the way?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
About us.
I'm thirsty.
Aw, okay.
A man?  Was it a dream?
I've asked him what's wrong.
He'll never appreciate it more.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Here, take this out to the table.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
And it's a shorter commute.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Honey, are you okay?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
All new houses have noises.
What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
What?
There might be some extras in the garage.
I'm having the floor fixed,
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Look, I think we should work things out.
I think it's time I came home now.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
What for, dickweed?
It's fun.
Do you have enough money?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Right over here.
Even better.
Even cosier.
Would you?
Uh huh.
Really.
Not now.  I'm busy.
They appear to be authentic.
This ties in with Nash.
I think it was England.
What?
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
And Brenda?
You sure?
Get outta here.
Sing.
That's all?
Yes.
For what?
If it came down to it what would you do?
She's the King's cousin.
You.
It's done.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
She's a treasure she is.
She'll soon be of age.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How?
Sometimes.
You'll no see me again.
I cannot explain.
Do you love me, Conner?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
A lucky guess.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
I'll be fine.
Then who's Russell Nash?
I don't know anymore.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
I've lived all over the world.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I wanted to get to know you better.
Yes -- it is.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why not?
On the back it has--
It will end tonight.
Must you fight him?
Get out.
Conner?
What's that next to him?
His head.  Someone cut it off.
And this?
I was working on the cataloging.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
The Kurgan was a pussy.
I don't know.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
Yes.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Get to work.
I'm going to my desk.
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Not if they're looking at something else.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
I'm not going to die for this!
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I'm here.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
My father.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
I'm getting a doctor!
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
You can't run with suitcases.
We don't have time!
They'll cut the power.
You have his address?
I don't eat junk food.
You fucked up, Glen.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
I think you got no choice.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Close.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Shh, they'll hear you!
I don't drink beer.
We can't make the microwave work.
Mars?  What are you doing?
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Another minute.  Please --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
Tell her I'm almost home.
Go.
She didn't answer.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Go, Mickey.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
What?
Where's the office?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
In my room.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
They're still in the house.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Smith will know.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
A delegation.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
I don't have that much.
And four children?
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes we have.
What was the response?
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
You said you had no whiskey.
Bring back your policemen...
Today.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
What is it?
Oh my God!
Fuck you.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
Thank God.
Give me the phone.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He will be here.
Show me your ID
What?
Our cards, please.
What cards?
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Of course.
What?
I tried already. The phones do not work.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
It will do just fine.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
We have been abandoned.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
What does it matter.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen!
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please, please try one more time.
No! Sit down now.
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
We are almost out of everything.
What sort of plan?
What's wrong?
How dead?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What! Paul storms off.
The lieutenant wants the register.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Many beers.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Where?
On the street.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
I don't know.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Oh dear.
Ms. Marr!
Is she alright?
I don't know!!
As a tumor.
And I think that's case --
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
Nothing.
The...Fourth of July.
Poor Mr. Price --
What?
Over here!
Take the gun.
-- yeah, we did that --
Don't push it.
You need to get out more.
Why not?
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- listen to the man --
Let's try down here...
Better living through electricity.
-- was that??
Jesus!
So where's the party?
I know.
-- in the act.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
Question answered.
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
I was in the middle of --
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
No, no, it's just --
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
My wife. Where were we?
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Maybe if I --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
I never saw you --
-- no more --
Please! I need your help.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
Rewind that.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
What's going on?
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Why not?
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- ten.
Over here.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- I'm coming --
You say you saw some activity here?
What's the matter?
What will they tell you?
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
By freeing them.
Well I bet you they're happy.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Well then who did?!
Who...is Colleen?
No it won't - no it won't!
She talks to me.
I'm scared!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
We'll get it later.
Go to your room!  Now!
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's hiding.
Take me to her.
My God, I heard something!
Sure.  Did you see the others?
I want this one, daddy.
He's blessing the house.
That's great, honey.
Don't be afraid!
Daddy, please!!!
Good night daddy.
I just, I don't know...
To our family.
I don't know.  That's strange.
I don't know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Are you ok?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
I think everything's ready.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
Aubrey!
Ok...
We're not going.
What's happening!
I'm all right...
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Maura.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
May I come in?
Come back to us honey!
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
It will not take long...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not at all, if it can help.
Well what is it!
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
Your apartment.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Why are you so interested?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
What?
I'm trying to quit.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
I'll do it!
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Oh, Terri ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Uh-huh.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Wow.  Thank you.
No.  Thank you.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
But how in God's name ...
It has already begun.
Not quite.
JP?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
I laughed, I cried.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
Why not just go now?
Don't worry, we'll get it...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Yes way.
Last rites, sister?
You're supposed to be dead!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Oh.  No.
Wha.....
I don't care.
But you're going to tell us anyway...
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Just shut up and hit me!
Sharp.
Snappy.
The Shazzammeter!
The Hipster!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Lumbago.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You do?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Consider this my resignation --
Huh?!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
I'm sure you do.
I thought you served misfits here!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck they doin'?
This you're familia' with.
...Geez.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
An example must be made!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
...It is?
But, Buzz, you know I never --
And Sid says you stole it!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
No, sir.
But, sir! --
Oh my God, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ya get the special?
There's one in every story.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She looks in her purse...
The mark notices.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Hello, Niagara.
He notices.
...Her mother needs an operation...
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
She is!
Thank you for waking me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
At the Houmfort.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Ti-Joseph?
I've never heard of a cure.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Yes.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
It's my day off.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I'm sorry...
Many people thought her beautiful.
And charming?
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I often do.
I imagined this so differently...
Help me? How?
I hated her.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Right o'.
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
I wasn't star--
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Good night.
What do you think?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
I... I think I am...
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
What?
Stuffed and baking.
You go dry off now.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
See for yourself.
You think I --
I have no idea.
Don't be dim.
If you're going to insult me --
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
That this was going to be a key party?
I'm not.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Fine.
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
Yeah?
Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Yeah.
But what?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Yeah. You?
Hi Wendy.
Who?
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
It's not like we're too busy.
How'd you know?
Educated guess.
No need to make excuses --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Now you are being rude.
Where you going?
What?
Moisture! Moisture!
One for you and one for me.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
You going to tell dad?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Thanks for the advice dad.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
No one.
Geometry?
Out.
It's freezing.
Sure.  Twinkie?
I'm chewing.
Tell Sandy? What?
I dunno. I --
There's a TV in the basement.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
Huh?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Her name's Libbets.
Hey Sandy.
Yeah? See ya.
Just thought I'd stop by.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Vodka?
One more shot?
Okay.
I don't know. How do I know?
That's all, for now.
What's that, then?
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Do it again.
But there wasn't any...
Twelve years younger.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Worth pursuing?
Byrd's dead.
Where is he?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Anything.  It's important.
We'll get the other one, though.
Around twelve-thirty.
Has her books in it.
I told her to come.
What?
That's right.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
That's right.
Seven years.
That's right.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
I'm always all business.
That's not what he thinks.
What did he look like?
What is it?
But she was seeing someone else on the side.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Since grade school.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
That's what I said.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
Who?
Yes down at the station.
I was a mentor to her.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Told you I could write an ending.
But we work so well together...
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
No back-up.
You're not following procedure.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
Surely you know the one who made you...
You mean we are not children of Satan?
I have not spoken to him...
Knew? You mean he is...
Listen to me.
If you say so. You are innocent.
How he must have loved you.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
I can't save her.
What night? What do you mean?
Is this my birthday?
It will grow back again!
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
What have you done?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Why not?
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
The swamp...
I can't. Go away from me.
Still my beautiful child.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes, and very beautiful.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You really believe that?
It's only mortal death.
You want death? Is it death you want?
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I want it!
I can't do it.
You've just done it -
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Sure...
I want a woman.
The crucifix -
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Read her thoughts.
I can't.
As did the one who made me.
I don't pretend to know.
I know. Let her alone.
What are you saying?
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Is that bad?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Who? Who is here?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
No.
No means yes.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
No, I'm the King of the World.
I also promised Tyrell.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Okay, I won't.
Yes.
No.
Just kidding.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
I've got to see.
What do we do?
No, you're not.
...Nancy?
You're okay. Thank god.
Is he?
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
It's gonna be great.
You know me to well.
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Ben Willis.
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
Right. Now I remember.
Are you sure?
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Did you get help?
I guess so.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
How's Julie?
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
He leave you?
No. I shot him.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Crowded.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
I'll go find him.
My friend -- what can one say --
I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
Sleep well.
I think not.
On my word! That's what they believe.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
How old is she?
I was looking for you.
Thea is an orphan.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
You have forgotten my last name?
My last name is Pherides.
The General — you don't even know him.
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
Wouldn't I?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ——
Her family name?
She's not too well.
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I can't understand that.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Listen to what I say --
When you make sense I'll listen.
Everything's so simple. I like you.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
The General threatened me.
I can't.
He hates all my race.
All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
All right –– all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
That's your problem, George Bailey.
George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
I know that girl!
Hiya, George!
Hi, Bert.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Of course it's the place.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Mother . . .
When'd you see him last?
Today, over at the house.
I won a flower.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Give the flower a drink.
Hee-haw!
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
All in . . .
Please don't go away –– please!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Yes, sir.
Aw, get going!
Yes, sir.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Hope you enjoy it.
Well, no younger than I was.
Maybe you were born older, George.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Very funny. Very funny.
Did you get a doctor?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
She was here first.
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Vi.
Nothing.
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
It's important.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
You like it? I'll send you a box.
Well, what about all your other friends?
I'll take chocolate.
I don't like coconuts.
Uh-huh.
Okay –– what can we lose?
You may kiss my hand.
Uh-huh.
Come on, tell me.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Do you like it?
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
Please, let's not stop, George.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Going up to see Zuzu.
You have no idea what happened . . .
What?
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Well, I don't know....
With butter, if they got any....
How fast is enough?
I want to go faster!
So's mine.
Someone pop your balloon?
No problem, no problem.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I think we're changing course a little.
Stop paddling!
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Good.  It's terrible.
They're moving pretty fast.
Yee-hah!
We better go back in.
It's not going to be easy.
I was counting on hours.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
The Shark.
We'll take your supercargo.
You're betting what you already got.
Sean!  Catch it!
Want to talk about it?
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
Over here!
The rope!  The rope!
What is it?  What's there?
It's still there!
I need a hand here....
Aren't you off-duty?
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
You got it.
Please.  It's my job.
You heard me.
Not till next year.
Yeah?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Too late, it's written.
You're damn right that's what it is.
First things first.
The Shark's mouth.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
Is there one in these waters?
Sound?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Right.
Home it is.
MMMmmmorning....
Door's locked.
Good.
Mrs. Silvera.
So's a donut.
In the den.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, huh?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Terrific.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Sean's asleep.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Going out.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
That's what he said.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
What's daddy doing?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hiya yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
That's you.
I've never been supercargo.
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Okay, okay, coming....
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Tina Wilcox.
I can't stop thinking!
What's that mean?
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Mmmmmm.
Until we find something.
What the hell is it?
Power line.
Oh, great.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
It'll be fun, come on!
I love it.
Coming about....
Might as well.
When are we going out?  You and me?
You going with Patrick?
Coming about, then.
How was dive class?
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
No.
Michael....
Oh, shit.
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Forget it, he won't listen.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
With those camera lights and...
He's going with you, Doctor.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
You buying?
Sure am.
Shit.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Want another one?
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Hope I make it through both.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
I guess.
See you later.
Okay, bye.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Get out of here!
I don't have a choice.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Just put your mask on.
Are you scared?
Yes.
Hi, baby.
They just wanted to say hello.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Nothing.
I know I can capture it.
Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
What's that?
Bracelets.
No.
How's your patient?
Me, too.
You don't.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
... He ought to put him in here.
Yes, you can.
What do you mean, we don't?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
I am.  You're not.
But you --
You don't have to prove anything.
I'm  fine.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
I told you, something's upset them.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
So do I, love.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
What in hell is that?
Let's hope he knows that.
Still sleeping.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Just watch it when he does.
Not at all.
Why are you?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
Some miss all their shots.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
Brian, he's coming around!
They still seem nervous.
I know.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
'Preciate it.
He's missing.
Thanks.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
Yeah, from Boston.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Sure am.
Come on!  Check this out!
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Now what's this do?
What, hon?
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
I am serious.
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
It's disappeared.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Aww, can't I keep it?
What the hell's there?
Polar bears.
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
No way.
That's impossible.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Got a job for me?
He needs a haircut.
Yeah, right.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
You know Overman?
We're in love.
Sure.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That bugger moves fast.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
That's what grandmas are for.
But you always let me....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Chicken....
We need milk....
I'll be right there.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Turn it off....
No....
I have work....
What's wrong?  What happened?
It went away....
I don't know....
I like it.  Really....
You caught me....
You're not interfering, Ellen....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Whatever happens next.....
You make sure they come?
What difference does it make?  It's here....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
We're going down.  All of us....
He knows what he has to do....
That....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
You check it....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
What's going on?
It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
Mommy lets me....
Who's coming?
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I didn't.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
Dad died from a heart attack....
I'm fine....
Good.  So will I....
You could teach...You could....
I'm not going to quit now....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
You look tired....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
No.
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
It could have been an accident....
It was no accident....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
No, you're not....
I'm terrific... Come on....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
But it gets cold in winter....
I like to travel....
Won't you get in trouble...?
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
Yes you can....
I have coffee in the thermos.
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Just like that?
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
How's Ellen?
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Stop busting my hump....
Try the area around the wreck....
You tagging them...?
We'll pass around cigars....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
You didn't stick them on right....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
They won't fight with me....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Money is money....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're afraid of the competition out there....
Stop busting my hump....
Down here....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
So far..
How long has he been here...?
Hoagie.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
She's not going to like it....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Just trying to be helpful....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
'Snuck up on me....'
I've got to get to her....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
It'll work....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
No way....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
Is it your vehicle?
We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Be my guest. What you got?
I think you're here all day.
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
So am I. But where's my money?
I haven't got it.
Then give me that Zippo.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
To throw out of the window.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You looked like you did?
Car accident.
You don't really believe this?
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I'm going up to the institute.
I guess by the bed.
It's twenty of three.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
No.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Maybe he's lying to you?
Wrong cabinet.
I don't know.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
Oh.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
I was married to her sister ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
Really? What did he say?
Which is what?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
No I'm not.
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not possible right now.
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I can't identify him ..
Then why didn't he kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I don't want them to arrest you.
Who sought the warrant?
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
No, Sir.
I think I've found a hand.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
One of the accountants.
You are not a loser.
I have to finish my job --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
It's over --
There is something missing here.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Wait.  What do you mean?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Oh, tell the story.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
No no. I knew.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Same to you.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Happy for us.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Yeah, thanks.
-- especially one like this.
And I am...
Sure.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Plus, you could use that commission.
Easy, easy --
And I appreciate that impulse.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
I don't know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
I think we made a mistake here.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thanks.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
I might call you later!
That's your word?
No, I'm saying to be --
Forget it.  Forget it.
No tell me. _ 84.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Damn right.
Beautiful.
Go.  Flee.
But wait...
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Dick.
You wanted smaller.
I'm not your brother!
Hi Ray.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Yeah I know.  I did.
Right up ahead, buddy --
What'd I say?
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
What is it?
A bird cage.
People change.
So do you.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Nothing.
Just drop it Paul!
Eric...
I filmed this the morning they left.
He's this way.
We have to help him.
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
You mean it?
He's not a kill, he's still alive.
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
It won't hold!
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
They're here.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
They never got that big.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
KEEP GOING!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
Raptors, mostly.
My favorite.
I try not to.
To a degree we never imagined.
Goodbye, Alan.
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
On the island.
Why?
You're right.
No we're not.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
Back out! Move!
It certainly does.
No.  I feel something.
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
-- my --
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Everyone, keep your voices down!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Come on!
What?  Why?
Good lad.
To collect my fee.
The velociraptors.
Piss.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Oh, God.
She's nuts.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Our chance to do what?
What do you think they want?!
No way.
No.
What are they?
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
She's with Sarah!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Look!  Sarah!
Why did you come here?
Because it exists.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
John Hammond.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
What?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
Oh, no!
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
It's not worth taking the chance, John.
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
The monitors are failing.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Pretty sure.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
They smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Small versions of adults, honey.
What kind of park is it?
The - - agility.  You're right!
We're out of a job.
Dilophosaurus.
Yeah, I know.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The other car!
Alan!
I don't know.
They're not here.
Stick to my heels.
Why not?
Like hell it is!
I get ah - -
I know, it's very exciting.
And scary.
Anti-nature.
Yeah.
Please - - chance it.
- - shut up.
Hola, bienvenido
What are we looking for?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Tim.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
You have no idea.
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Relatively.
We gotta do something.
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Let's get outta here!
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
It's safe.
It's safe.
All night?
You're a beautiful big animal.
Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
Don't do that!
Thanks for the presents.
We love the presents.
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
That was great!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Ken, we've been through this...
Yeah?
You have a map.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
Who's there?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Who?
Come on.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
He's fucking nuts.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
That's open to debate.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Add it to the list.
So what do we do?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Ten minutes...
Yes -- that's us.
Yes -- we do.
Have you worked here long?
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
A man must eat --  And drink.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's what I'm paid to do.
And you're late!
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Why were you given notice?
I wouldn't put it past him.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Was he depressed?
What makes you think so?
... Just a perception.
You mean you've actually begun some?
It's a farce.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Ludwig?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
No!
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Oh my God ... Ann?
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Why?
Compassion.
What's compassion, mister.
Did he come around often?
Look -- could I use your phone?
Why isn't he locked up?
I guess he figured it was better.
What was better? I made better bait?
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
-- Yes.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- OK?
Can't you get him?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Try some other ways. 
Not much point to this, is there?
But if it's someone else I do.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
What am I supposed to say?
I was wondering what that was.
Go down in my room.
I called Trina.
How do you know how bad it was?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You're going back?
Mm.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I better keep looking.
Where, how?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
It's in the report.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Yeah.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
Yes?
He's in his room, playing.
Good.  I'll see him in there.
What does?
Do you like to be with your mommy?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest...
Show.
Show...
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Will she pick me up after school?
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Uh huh...
We use the green and yellow.
In a minute...
You are not allergic of onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Yeah?
I'm sorry...
Uh huh?
You mean for good?
Sleep tight.
I love you...
See you in the morning light...
It's my name too.
You like it?
Are you going to get remarried?
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Was there Burger King?
What don't you understand, pal?
Overruled.
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
I...I don't know...
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
Yes.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I don't know...
So do you.
You have?
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Ted, do you love him?
Only can I still see him?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Yes, what?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's going to cost.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Any prospects?
Ten.
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
I'm sure.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What d'you tell her?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Any day.
Uh, huh...
A moment.
Yes. I am ready.
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
Tell me.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
Are you? Of whom?
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
No!
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
General Chiang.
It is calm.
We did not.
I am afraid.
Yes.
I miss him too.
Two.
We do not know.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
Do you have money?
Not until you are eighteen.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. Not very big.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
It is an island. American territory.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
When it is time.
In the Americas.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I had relinquished doubt.
The people will not allow it.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You will always!
I have smarter men.
It is a story, you decide.
As you say.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
The Chinese.
Yes.
Ahh.
Where is Poland?
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
No, Holiness.
Am I running away?
Eliminate you.
You are unharmed?
Completely.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Too young?
Much too young.
I see that.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
Why are we landing?
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
Then do it!!
I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
I don't know!
Get the gun.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
You ready on shore?
We're ready.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Just those two.
As if.  Will you miss me?
Are you sure?
Excuse me?
Eh.  Fuck it.
Guess I finally got bit.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
I <u>told</u> you.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
What?
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
You flew up here because your boss--
'Night.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
What?
I heard something.
I'm not mushing it.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--
You calm down!
<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
Look.
Well...
You wouldn't?
Take him.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They look like they're jumping.
Obviously I was wrong!
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Where is he?!
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
You too.
Did he say anything?
I'm fine, thank you.
This is a little different.
I can look at dead things.
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
Sheriff.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
It looks like a branch.
I just let go of it.
I asked you to be nice to him.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
What is this?
Yes.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Kevin, hey.
Yes, well...  famished.
I'm not even a field person.
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
But why? He didn't weight the others.
Hot damn, Clarice.
He knew her...!
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Murdered...? How?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
May I see your credentials?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
All flayed...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
No. You ate yours.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why? Do you know something about him?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
They all were.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Horses - and sheep...
Why so briefly?
I - ran away...
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No! That's incidental.
Yes...! They were screaming.
So you ran away...
Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
We leave in the morning?!
Can we rest soon?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Do not.  Promise me.
Maybe...
My letter...
There was none!
I sent three men to Webb!
It can be dangerous...
He delivered no such message.
I am sorry, Duncan...
...Fort William Henry.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Dark haired...
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
I don't understand!
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Fire!!!
Sir!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Yes.
For Munro children?
Yes.
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
What has?
Can you fix it?
No way...
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
No!
That's an order!
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up!  Try this!
Just get in yours!
What?
Still...you did the right thing.
Good...It's going good.
The escape bubbles?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Where's Jones?
I can't see them!
It bit me!
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes...
Unfortunately.  We can't.
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Timex...
Hook's on 24...
Russian.
It...almost got you.
What was it?
Itches like hell.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Twelve hours!
Under there?
Two hundred meters.
What are you going to do to him?
I'm going to try to remove it.
It's had a meal.
Let's hope it holds.
How is he?
DeJesus...It's got him.
The air's stopped.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
I'm not touching you!
Seven hundred for the pair.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
I thought this was a pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Can I help?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
They were going to pay, then?
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Try that one.
Sure is.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
Just give me the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
OK, open the gate.
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
And the weed?
Out the back.
Invitations?
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
What do you mean?
I mean it's fucking empty.
He means they're thieving dogs.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
What do you mean, me?
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
You will what?
For half a million?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
You've already been fifteen.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Er, well, twelve.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
--you're going to be on your own.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I am, sir.
The--the officers.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Because it's a job?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, sir.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
We were just dancing--
Sergeant?
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
That badge--
You got a cause of death?
A .45--
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
What?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
If it's too late--
Come on in.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Same as they done in Mexico.
But they were Indians themselves.
I got a pretty good guess.
That guy who got shot--
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
He's still pissed off about it.
No.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Made some money, came back here--
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Yeah?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
We been through this before--
We should just do it.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
That's where he fell.
Bandidos, Injuns--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
That's a matter of interpretation--
You go by your old house?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Charley Wade.
Hey, Sam.
Open late.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The Sheriff.
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
That's me.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
You ever play one of these?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if I can help it.
Okay? He's not here?
No. Is he sick?
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
And when my father was Sheriff?
Yeah?
For a while.
What do you think?
It's Saturday.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Time marches on.
How much you got left?
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
I'll see what's going on.
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Are you okay?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
So she tells me three times a week.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Most people did, yeah.
Nice-looking kid.
No--
They've got me. Different thing.
Yeah.
So what are we gonna do about this?
I've felt that way, yeah.
Yeah?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
Gotta be in person.
How 'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
Payne.
Why you think that was?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
Yeah.  It's French.
Thirty-five bucks.
Nix.
Nix?
Who is he?
You ever been married?
A Nix specialty?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Right.
That's so cool.
Why would I do that?
I told you --
All right.  It was...
I know him.  I saw him.
Death.
It's an illusion.
You'll do more.than that.
Not yet.
It's him... it's him.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Maybe he'll show you.
Be ready.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
And you don't ask questions?
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
That's my business. Harry.
Yes.  You do that.
He was the real thing, right?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
What then?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Quaid and Jennifer--
It's okay.
Hang on!
Harry...
...yes?
Yes.
I... have... to.
I think so.
Harry-?
Out!  Out!
Good.  There.  Yes?
You saw this?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
He got up and walked.
I heard he was the best.
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Mr. D'Amour?
Go away.
What are you, my mother?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Maybe I just bought it.
Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
Are you a gambling man?
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
A ticket home,
Yes.  It's regrettable
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
Yeah, I know.
Shut up!
Was that Swann's idea?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
Help me.
What about?
What?
Yes...
Who is he?
That.
Sure.  Vivovich.
For an introduction.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
He deserved it.
Will that do?  No?
Didn't know you read minds.
Jesus!
Looks that way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
In my time, and nobody else's.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Try.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
One question.
What?
Who is she?
Who's not?
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
And he's dead?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Why would I want to?
Liar!
Bob, it's me.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
You'll do it?
Yeah, I'll stay.
Try twenty-five.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
No, how about you?
See you later.
I know. I don't either.
It's Charlotte.
Charlotte, who?
I see them every morning.
No, you smiled.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
You're possessive.
I know.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
That's ok.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
We established that we have no communication.
No one ever tells you that...
How old is she?
Fuck off.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Working.
I don't want to be.
That's what you said the other night.
Hi, Bob.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Ok, bye.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
Can I enter?
Yes?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Yes?
Take them.
Hello, darling.
Bob?
Hi, Lydia.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Like Japanese food.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to- 
That's ok.
Hospital?
One moment, please.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
Sure.
Ok.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
What?
Bye.
I don't know.
Ok, I will... later.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Are you sure you have to go?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
What happened?
When did they find her?
Thank God he did.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I found them in your file box.
Must be a spare set.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Peter, are you okay?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
You heard voices, you know you did.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
Just open the door, please.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
And also that...
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Peter, please...
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
What?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
We're going to do this.
You have to say that.
Maybe that's my problem.
What are these?
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Whish the circumstances were different.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
You are the younger of two...
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
It's Detective Smythe.
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
He's looking right at me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
What happened?
Child, take a bite.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Need any help?
I can manage.
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
Yeah, you met her?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
There you go.
The blue.
You sure?
Thanks, sweetheart.
Okay.
Huh?
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
Shh.  It's okay.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Get used to it, babe.
Why not?
I don't know sometimes.
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
And he's fine, girl.
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
I was just showing emotion.
Chances are there's still a chance.
I'll take that as a compliment.
She hates all freshmen.
Didn't have to try very hard.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
Okay.
Five seconds.
Your legs don't look broke.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.
Would you watch the damn road?
Didn't know you cared so much.
Good.
Hey.
You having fun?
Yeah.
Guess not.
Figures.
What?
I know, right?
What'd it say?
I can't be nice to a fan?
What?
My court, I go first.
Plan to.
Right here.
I wanted you to.
Why not?
Nobody.
Who's nobody?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Nah.  I have curfew.
Hey, what's up.
You weren't at my game.
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I never asked you to choose.
You don't think so?
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I forgot, "Q-man."
Kiss my ass.
What do you mean?
So...how's the knee?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Cause I don't get it.
Something was just missing.
We need to talk.
From basketball.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
What?
So you're gonna bitch up?
Hey.
Well, can you give him this for me?
Business folks.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
What's that, not great?
He tore his ACL.
Uh, your earring?
You hearing me?
Yup.
Said he'd be home later.
Sorry.  You okay?
I'm fine.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You know, people.
I just told you.
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We need to talk.
Came by to check on you.
Good.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
ooohhhhhh no.
In my sleep, Burt.
What's wrong?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Does this sound weird?
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's a helluva disease.
Sure is.  So why call me?
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

Yeah, but I don't know --

About two years ago.
Bit messy.
Yeah.
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
You take cream or sugar?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.

Bye, bye, Claudia.
Good bye.
Well...is that illegal?

NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
DAD --
That idea is over now. We're not gonna do that now.
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
I ain't fuckin with you --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
I was listening --
He's doing the interview with the lady --
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
That's right.
You see?
Stay that way.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Braces.
Braces?
Yes I do.
Your teeth are fine.
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
I need to sit down.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?

Other fuckin' assholes like me.
There's no asshole like you.
Go fuck myself?
You got it.
Who are you gonna call?
Jack.
...Lily...?
No.
Is this 509-9027?
Yep.

-- just to clarify --
So boring, so useless --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
What am I doing?
So you sat it out, that's what you did?

Hollywood, mainly.
Well I guess it doesn't.
Does you mother still work?
Are you close?
She's my mother.
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.

I wouldn'tve asked --
Not a problem.
Psychology major?
Right.
In five years?
What name?  My name?
It's not your given name, right?
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
About three weeks ago.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Yeah.
It's interesting.
Mmm.
You can't just come in here.
I am calm.
No one else in here?
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
And what about screaming?
Been drinkin' today?
I didn't hear anything.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Yeah. Yes.
What happend to you?
I got in trouble at school.
Fuck no.
You want her right now?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Are you alright?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
Love you too..
Bye.
It'll take the pain away.
It's not really pain.
I'm a bad person.
Yeah.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Who?
Rose, I don't --
hey.
Paula.  Ellen.
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
What about now?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
I don't.
I'm not through asking my questions.
Maybe...I don't...
I don't know.
But you can't say....
You should know better.
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
I'm Bob.
You're her boyfriend?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
I'II go....is it...back here?
It's alright.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Hi.
818-753-0088.
Partridge?
Yeah.
mmm.hmm.
Water.
Bottled Water?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
What do you do?
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I need this one.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
-- I didn't see you from the window.
See you.
I didn't know the answer --
I said I'm fine.
Hi.
..sorry...
Hi.
..sorry...
It's ok.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
D'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
He is nothing now.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Shut up, knave!
I am with you!
Making the key to the throne.
A body.
I have it all worked out.
And people close to him, who --
Three days??!!
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
But -- what is he doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
You're a fool!
Perhaps he serves a different king.
To the Bastille.  And death.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Forgiveness?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
We go someplace dangerous.
Why didn't you say so?
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Athos, my friend!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Oh my friend.
Athos, I beg you --
To kill the king.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
Porthos told me.
Your mother's.
She will be at the ball.
How did you --
Just... water.
Silence!  I order you!
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
... tired.  Must... lie down.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
... You knew you had a double?
He is my brother.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
There.
I must insist, Sire.
I am unhurt --
No, Keeper.
Thank you, Keeper.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
It's lovely.  It's just...
My dear, I've already done it.
Yeah?
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you need?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What do you think?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I didn't hit shit!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Right behind you.
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
And who are you?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I'll live...
And what did he do to the girl?
He said he was following up some lead.
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
Yeah?
Where up north?
Seattle.
You'll find out - soon enough.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What exactly did you see?
What did you do then?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Please...
I killed them.
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
OK...where do you want to start?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Hop in.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Then what did you do, play canasta?
County jail - get in.
Where is he?
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
I don't recommend it.
Twenty minutes max.
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Library of Congress.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Why not?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I am all right.
As long as they're dead...
These are all dead, Will.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
To recover the mind set.
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
Get me a plane!
I won't be here.
When I'm done.
How do I know?!
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
What's that?
Have him peel the top label back.
See if there's another label underneath.
What?
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
It's happening again, Jack...
He went to the men's room.
For Christ's sake get him!
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
In eight days.
In the kitchen.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I'm fine.
Are you okay...?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Francis...?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I'm very scared.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
Are you a man?
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Chilton.
Yes?
Yeah. It's right here.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
Hi, Linda. ..
Thank you very much.
I don't understand.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why do you think I called?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
He asked how you are.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
At the store. You doin' some good?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Tell me about yourself.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I have to see somebody.
Blue is cold.
You haven't smoked in two years.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Then why?
Is Crawford going with you?
Will? Are you okay?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Will?  You could come up here.
You going back down to Florida after?
Tell her I called.
Go on to the house.
Lt. Fisk said...
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
Are you gonna kill him?
...after a while.
...yes.
I got it. Thank you.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
Pictures?
Yes.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
I don't have one right now.
I haven't decided yet.
Let's walk the route.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Hi George!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
You've got good days and bad days.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Oh!
Twenty!
Ten.
Deal.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No thanks.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
Oh, it's open.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Andy... there is no real you.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
And you're just poor white trash!
And you're just poor white trash!
What?!?
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Yes, your Holiness?
Positive.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
There!
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
Bob.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
It's already begun.
Know what?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
No way.  Not possible.
What?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Oh, God.
It's Choi.
I know.  It's her fault.
Two grand.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
Hear what?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
An accident?!
No!
What are you doing?
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
... Yeah.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
How?
Any time.
Just get me outta here.
Goddamnit!
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
They'll be able to track it.
We have no choice.
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Stand up and see for yourself.
Yes.  Now.
Yes.
Go!  Now!
How do you know all this?
Why not?
You've never used them before.
Your training.
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
I think I do.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
Yes.
That I would find the One.
Shit, I'm sorry.
My name is Trinity.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From you.
It's going into replication.
What?
That's different.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
No.
She told me...
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
What happened?  What did you see?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
We have to!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I'm going in after him.
I have to.
Because...
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.
The Oracle.
They're hacking his mind.
Neo, this has to be done!
Tank, it's me.
You're not far from Cypher.
Cypher, I thought --
I'll be all right.
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
Follow me.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
You got sparklers?
Well the guy over there said...
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Ok.  Wait here.
Can't we come with you?
Uh...can we give you a check?
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
'And with your spirit.'
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
She don't look Jewish.
Kennedy.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah.
You flew before?
No.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Panther!  Same thing...
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
What do you mean?
Didn't show up.
I could have told you that.
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Did you see them run!
Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Mind your own business.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
OK, get in.
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
Charlie, this is business.
Yeah, where's the rest?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Ok.
Oh...around...why?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Nothing.
Wha?
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Do you have enough?
Well...
I don't mind.
Maybe, who knows.
Charlie...?
Don't ask.
No.
Watch your language.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Come on.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
You could say that.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Friends of yours Michael.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Thanks.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
His wife?
Love that name.
He's cute.
Very.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
And you could care less --
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Annie made them.
It's for the party, Dad --
Oh, the goddam party --
I wasn't going to say --
But what?
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Both.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
You mean this, sir?
Hi.
What 'business'?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Am I not obligated to?
Hello, Quince.
'Here'?
Hot or cold.
Cold.
And a glass.
"Death and Taxes"?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.
Yes.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Me, too.
You have a way with words.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
'Just kidding'?
Sit down, Drew.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Joe, you do get around.
Yeah, that's what he said.
Well, that's very interesting.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
That's what he said.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
What you then?
I from dat nex' place.
Some spot you pick.
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Make it time.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
My Doctor Lady?
Mine, too.
You loved back?
I am.
She knows how she feel.
Hi, Jennifer.
Nothing?
Good morning, Jennifer.
The Board is waiting.
It's so very nice to see you again.
You're welcome.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Oh yes, I do.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I don't have any.
I can see why.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I came to see you.
Watch me do what?
Whatever you do.
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I don't mind --
Not now.
Excuse me?
And I appreciate you, too.
Yes...I've found that it does.
Has her pain abated?
Girlfriend?
No.
No.
To bed.
'To bed'?
Yes.  I'm tired.
-- I guess you haven't.
It was everything.
I am.
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
For how long?
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
'Love will find out the way'.
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
-- Yes?
Thank you.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
It is a deal?
A 'deal'?
Yes?
Yes, Bill.
There's one to every rule.
I'm not everybody.
That's what everybody says.
I understand.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Absolutely.
You were just curious?
I guess...
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
Goodnight.
That's okay.
What's okay?
Then I can't help you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I told you, 'watch it'.
Yes?
Yeah.
I was just asking, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
An offense --
An indictable offense.
Thank you.
'...Yes --'
Death!
That's me.
You should hope quite a while.
Speak up, please.
I didn't ask any question.
I believe you did.
I don't!
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
Please.  Talk to me --
I think you know --
Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
I'm here.
Time.
I'm sorry --
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Hi, honey.
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
Yeah.  I guess so.
I know it's none of my business --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Uh oh --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
What were you going to say?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Aw, you're tough.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
What?!
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Will it?...
Joe?
I don't know.
I'm having a helluva time.
Yes, but --
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Nothing lasts.
I agree --
Did I say something wrong?
From what?
That's it.
Burt.
Seen you together, that's all.
What?
No, let's go.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Interested in buying one?
Yeah, I remember you.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Take the money and walk away!
I don't want your fucking money!
Is that what your little note says?
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Don't remember.
Yeah. You?
Who is he? What have you got me into?
What?
Course not.
What happened?
I'll go see him.
I told him about your car.
Why would you do that?
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
No!
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
How?
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
About your whore of a wife?
Thanks.
Sweet.
Dying.
What?
What do you want?
A BEER, please.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Well, that's me.
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
I don't know.
Then why are you here?
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
I guess I've told you about my condition.
You're in a playful mood.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
No! Should I?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Give me your keys.
What's wrong with this one?
You like it? Let's trade.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Why are you following me?
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
You won't remember!
Why would I do that?						    *
You can't just take it!
What's your twenty?
We know these people...!
"And" what?
He any good?
Oh, yeah...
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
It's a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
We're not certain!
Yes you do...

I'm a fiend for mojitas.
It goes very fast.
Show me...?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Havana.
She's dead...
I dance...
No.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Hola, viejo.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What's the best fortune you ever got?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
Where would I go?
I know.  And now?
Alonzo...
Stevens?
Something's wrong.
Nothing.
Port-Au-Prince.
Five minutes...
On my way back...
Verdado.
Verdado where?
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Chill out Sonny.
As in...?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Twenty on my man...
You're giving away your money, fool...
Okay.  What's up?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
To recruit you.
Sonny...?
Yeah.
On the phone.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...

White supremacist types.
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yeah.
You sure?
...and thanks for the flowers.
"Salutations from the south..."
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
You set this up!
Do we need this...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
What...?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Lotta rich women back there...
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Yeah, oh yeah.
Sure you're all right?
I know. Scribbage!
Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
For money.
For money for what?
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
Twenty bucks...
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
I'm scared.
What of?
They gotta be.
Yeah.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I'm wet.
You're what?
What?
Get outta my way.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Ready for anything.
No. You got it.

Getchmis...?
Where?
What?
Listen!
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
Don't make me laugh.
Ziat!
Billy?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
The Hilton.
For the money... )
Oh Jesus! 
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty?
How much?
Yes.  I think so.
Just what?
Something like that. Cigarette?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
How much did you figure to make?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Be tough on 'em.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
Twelve years.
A hundred grams.
It's not fair!
Seven years...
Hello.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah!
Jimmy?
Two thirty.
What?  You gotta be joking.
Oh we... we...
It's already been cut.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
Max - where?
Maybe he's changing jobs.
You can't take anything seriously.
My passport!
No!
You're ayip!
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Who?
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Yeah...?
Take a look.
Right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
You got a better way up?
Just do it!
Oh, Jesus!!
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
The kid's with them!!
Go!! Just go!!
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
You did!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
So?
No, there's...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
No such thing, baby.
I was just late.
Toss the flare down!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
Just do it!!
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
I can.  We can do this...
Ah...
Talk to me.
Peter...
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
No shit.
What?
Anything you can tell me might help.
What are they...?
If you wouldn't mind.
I don't have a title yet.
It has no nobility.
My pleasure.
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
No problem.
Then who did?
No big deal.
So you've indicated. Do it.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
It'll only take a second.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Nothing.
Not even a hint?
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
That's disgusting.
Three more chapters to go.
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Four or five days ago. Why?
Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Oh, I like that tone.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
There's that spice again.
Buster.
If I can.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
From her point of view or mine?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How do you that.
Ahh..
Mmmm.
And my room?
I suppose I did.
What else?
Well, that's good, isn't?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
And you're happy about that?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Then we got'em!
Not for seven more minutes.
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
Far right.
- torque wrench.
Do what?
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Ethan Hunt.
Who wants to be decent?..
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.
That they're lying.
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
Then feel better!..
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Just about..
Oh Ethan!..
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Why did you phrase it like that?
You gotta be kidding.
Like?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
I'm fine..
Why not?
Yep.
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I told her to get outta there.
Good job.  And thanks.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Do I?
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
S.O.P..
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Always.
May take a little time.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Sleeping's better.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You didn't have to.........
Bastard!
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Go secure.
Theyíre dead.
Whoís dead?
One hour.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Why was there another team?
I don't quite follow you.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
What kind?
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
On what?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
Where exactly is it?
We'll see.
Time up.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Just don't chew it.
I didn't touch it.
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Then what am I doing here?
He's our guy.
Can you lose him?
No.  Abort.
<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
I usually am.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
What's going on?
Jack you're so wicked.
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
Itís not working.
Run it through from the top.
The Shawfish?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Why you drinking so much?
You're welcome.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
What killed him?
I won't come.
Yeah.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Let's go tell your Mother.
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
He's in Palermo.
Let me come and talk to you.
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
Excuse me.
Maybe I should come back another time.
I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.
I know that. I do what I want.
He knew my husband who died.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Why what?
I don't know.
Stupid.
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Yes.
I'm telling you your life!
No!
A wolf without a foot!
Where are you taking me?
To the bed.
I was dead.
I was dead, too.
That light.
It makes you look like an angel.
What?
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
What did you do?
You ruined my life.
Why not?
I can't!
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Kinda gaudy.
For what?
It's the best thing there is.
I think that's it.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
You're making me feel guilty again.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I'm here!
We're here.
That's right.
I'm really afraid.
Why?
And you're not now?
He's coming.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Ronny, please...
What!
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
Johnny.
Never is a long time.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
Seven-thirty.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
A month from today?
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
Where's the ring?
Why not?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Where you been?
What! How do you know?
A wife knows.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
No more he's not.
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
Did you see it?
Oh.
I don't know.
Did you see the moon last night?
Where is she?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
My mother's recovered.
You're kidding?
Yes.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I don't know.
Johnny...
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
I am alone in the world.
It's nothing!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
She was just too young for you.
Will you join me for dinner?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
People home.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
Well. That explains it.
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
It's Cosmo's moon.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
I knew she had it.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Does wood sink in water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
You're using coconuts!
...What?
Through ... We found them.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Am I right?
I'm not interested.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
The Britons.
Who are the Britons?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Oh!
NI!   NI!
We want ... a shrubbery!
Of course.
And not too expensive.
Now - go!
What, "is"?
What?
None shall pass.
So be it!
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
You're a liar.
What?
Look!
Had enough ... ?
I'll have your leg.
Come Here.
You're a looney.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Well, what are you then?
Bedevere, my Liege.
No.  No.  No!
Just keep me covered.
What does it say?
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
You know my name?
A Grail?
What?
There he is!
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
What?
I warned you!
Who did we lose?
Man!
What?
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Course it's a good idea.
Do me a favour.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
I don't know that!
Here's one!
Ninepence.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
They cost fifty pounds each!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
Father, lad.
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Herbert.
I'm ... your son ...
Not you.
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Leaving the room ... yes.
If we ... er ... 
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, not anyone else - just me.
Yes ...  make sure ...
We're coming with you.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Camelot ...
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Why?
We'll cover your escape!
Look - I'm fine!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
... I Bet you're gay.
No, I'm not.
Ector.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Please ... we are doctors.
I'm sorry, I must go.
Well ... yes ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Shut up.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
Bravely ran away, away.
No, no, no.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
I'm getting dressed.
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll get over it.
She means it.
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
What do you take me for?
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Convey her a message.
Do you know who you address, sir?
The future King!
Out of my way!
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
Back and upper corridors.
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Yes.  I do.
Yes, it most certainly is!
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
It can wait.  Anything else?
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
Oh.
Surely --
Maybe, once.
Then I envy yo.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
See what?
Too busy looking after themselves.
The greasy pole.
No love.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
She's well, too.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
He thought so, yes.
Yes.
What?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I am told so.
What does he know about the Highlands?
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
To keep out the cold.
I heard something.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Oh, several things.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
I hope he got his mother's permission.
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
Yes, ma'am.
What is he doing there?
Why was I not told earlier?
Again?
I have no idea.
Why not?
What is it?
I have a letter, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
How'd you know it was us?
Why don't we take this into my office.
What the hell does that mean?
Hey, kid.
No, in person.  Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm coming over.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Laurie's.
Let's go around back.
What?!
We can't...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
The Police, then...
I don't know.
What?
And beat it at it's own game.
Yes I am...
I know.  It sucks.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Don't even say it.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Right, then...
What?!  There's nothing here!
Look around...
We don't have a choice!
There never is.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story...
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
That way.
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
You have no time.
Of course I am.
But I don't understand...
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?
But I'm not broke.
It's been a very strange day.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
There is no problem.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
You're an understandin' fella.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
Wow!
You got it! See you later honey.
I was afraid of that.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Good luck, honey!
Are you okay?
Yes.
Was anyone hurt?
Diane?
Number 17.
But it said #12.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
No...I need to sleep.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Mulholland Drive?
We'll take our check.
Maybe it's not me.
Call the number.
I'm not sure about this.
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
Could be unrelated.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Palmdale.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Not a coke or anything?
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Yeah, I'd say that's it.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
I don't know.
We wait. This is an elevator.
Give me a fucking.....
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
I'm leaving.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
We drown.
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
Know what ? That it was your fault ?
Fine...
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Girder, watch your head.
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Not quite....
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Ow...
Thanks...
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
But, he's...
I said NO.
Got it.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Excuse me, sir ?
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
I don't know.....
What happened ?
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
I meant him.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Thank you.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Nothing.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What about living in the real world pal?
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
So, what's on your mind?
Seriously.
Great.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Totally groovy huh?
Totally.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Give my love to Shelly.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's hungry.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
You mean, you knew about me?
You are?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Come on in!
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
He likes you.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
Hi.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Your mother?
But we made a business deal.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
I won't.
You're over reacting!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Get married?
Change my name.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
You would.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T!!!
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Yeah?
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Part adventure...part miracle.
No?
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
For the mini-bike fund.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Bye.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
This is it I guess.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Phil for God sake.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well maybe for you.
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
What do you mean?
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
You leave your father to me.
Hey! Oh look.
He's so tiny.
You have no idea.
O.K.
He is?
Do you know him?
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
All right, here.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
It's there.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I think it's still available.
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
Deceased.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
No kidding?
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
It's nice.
Here?
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
Good.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'm looking forward to that.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
You can get the general idea...
Did you ahh, love him?
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
What?
The money?
You never cared before.
Can I go too?
Soon honey, soon.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
Get away, get away!!
Why?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
For this class?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I wrote a poem too.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Do you think she is?
Oh.
I am.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Thomas?
What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.
No, I'm divorced.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Uh huh, why?
See food!
Oh great!!
Yes!!
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I'm eleven and a half.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Goodnight.
I'm allergic to it.
To chocolate?
I can't, I have to go home.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Hurry!
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It'll bleed.
Okay, OW!
No.
Come on, it's fun.
What?
Hey, where does it say that?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
Don't DO that!!
Sorry.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
Bed wetter!
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
What?
Stand back.
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
But I have my clothes on!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Bye Ma.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Like they do on TV?
No.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
Just, hurry.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
Part of being a New Yorker.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Desperate.  To talk.
We're about to find out.
I have a suggestion...
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
When I'm talking to children.
Go figure you.
You've been working on this, huh?
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Let's not get carried away.
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
That was Thursday.
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Manicure...
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
... whatever is manly and independent.
Exactly what?
Only.  If he wants to.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
It doesn't say th...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
W...
Mirrors.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
Quite the little eccentric.
Waiter! Check, please!
She finds him "personable."
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You keep saying that.
No.  I've got you.
The night we met.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
It's over.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Well.  How come she didn't...
She admits it's her fault.
Shhh.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Lower.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Almost three.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Right here.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I know that, Star.
Hi! Star.
Come on.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
No.
What's wrong honey.
Then why are you listening to her -
What?
How did you come in here?
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Your job, huh.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Barbara Jean.
You know better than that.
It's on National television, Barnett.

Haven's not going to talk to me.
Hi, Sherry.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
I think we can do that. Come in.
I'1l get your bag.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
Who's that?
Well, he's really amazing.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Need a ride?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
No.
Get in.
Nash.
What year?
Sixty-three.
Oh... Well.
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
How do you know if they do?
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
And before?
He's a member of our congregation.

I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure. Where?
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Hi.

I'll be there.
How much?
Yes.
You're not.
Sleeping.
I mean...
Mary?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Depends on what I'm studying.
Just a minute.
Hello.
I'm Opal.
Why?
Where is she?
No, we never did that
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Southern California.
You always live there?
Who?
Is that good?
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Sure thing.
May I see your costume?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Which do you recommend?
When ya had it, did ya like it?
You got something you want to do?
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
You've heard of it?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
She was born without a tongue.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
What?
Anything.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Look, I'll trade you.
Not good.
Ready.
Wagons, hooaaa!
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
She sings? What does she sing?
Describe Mallory.
When have they ever been right?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Mickey, you're wasting time!
I do, too.
And a snake-eye glare.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Take a wild stab!
That's my opinion.
Jesus...
Next week's episode.
Rockin'!
Scotty?
Wayne Gayle.
Wayne Gayle!
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
How 'bout Mallory?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Slate it.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Out.
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.
What d'you say, Duff?
Hell, you got steady work.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
You in a big hurry, boy?
That's right.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Where's he at?
I don't know.
How 'you doing?
Okay.
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
Where was your father born?
Well, he worked around.
And his age?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
You must be new in town.
No. I'm new in town.
You work around town?
I'm a teacher.
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I like a place with lots of life.
No thanks.
What is it?
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Don't Duff--
Take it easy.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
That's the way he is.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
I'll see you later.
What's he like?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
I'll have some coffee, please.
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
Well, what d'you think?
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
You didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
I don't want to hurt you.
Go on - hit me!
You jivin' me?
Well, I haven't come around.
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Yeah.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
There's nothing to say.
Well, that'll be the first time.
Duff--
'Round town.
Take it easy, Frankie.
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
'Got a good thing, man.
'Bye, Jocko.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
I heard you.
Beat it!
Better get him to a hospital.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
How 'you gonna live?
Good-bye, Duff.
How are you?
All right, son.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
It's for your own good.
I'll be seeing you.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Hell, I didn't know you was married.
That'll make the folks very happy.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Okay, boy, beat it.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Like hell you ain't!
What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Anything you say, baby.
I'm still on my honeymoon.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Then we would have talked, you and I.
Of course...
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Why not?
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Good, because you've got a new one.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
No, but it traced me.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
The words?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
I don't have a girl.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Can you walk?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Maybe so...
Never heard of him.
Nobody has.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
We got problems topside.
Less than thirty minutes.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
How's the ice?
You haven't got it?
I don't know. I don't know...
Why should I want to meet him.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What about before that?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What's that supposed to mean?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
So you're a wire junkie.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Put the gun down, Case.
Case...
Shhh...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
Hold on.
What?
What are you talking about?
Well, do you?
Sure. No problem.
Yes, it's lame.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
YOU KNIT?
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
If you say so.
Who told!
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
That is lingerie.
Very romantic.

Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
You crossed over.
Do I want to be crunched?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Eh.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
They hid my car--
Dude, you rock!
Hey. There.
I'm Rob's prom date.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
It was a long time ago -
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Little known fact.
That's the spirit!
Thanks. And what are -
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Thank you.
You remember that story?
Don't look down!
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
I know.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
To put us back together again when we fall.
Yeah, actually I do.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
What?
I don't know.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Yeah. Definitely.
Maybe we should sit.
Lock.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Barrel.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
We can handle it.
For this.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Good.  I'm hungry.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
No.
Why not?
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Don't be a smart ass.
Just out for a while.
No.  Upstairs.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
Ken!
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
Only the wet ones.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
It's happening again.
Ah, nothing.
That's okay, I wanted to.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
What do you mean?
C'mon, cut it out.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
I'll get over it.
What is it?
Oh, Jesse...
You want to talk about it?
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Hi.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
Eggs?
Okay, I guess.
Making friends?
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Hi, Kerry.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
We're going to bed.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
First door up the stairs.
Can't it wait till morning?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
How's your hand?
They're healing up nicely.
No, she's right.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
He's close...
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
How do we find him, Kristen?
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Thank you.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Call me Nancy.
Didn't get much sleep.
Well, we've got --
Never been here before?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Doesn't matter.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Remember -- open mind.
Everybody take five.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
They used to keep a spare key.
What are you talking about?
What?
Listen.
A sad choice.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Me too.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Oh God.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
Here, let me help.
Coffee?
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Oh right.
Thanks.  Well...
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Hello.
Okay.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow?
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
She left me.
Why?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I don't know either.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Oh no no -- no.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
What do you think?
Yes.  Always have had.
Big feet -- large shoes.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Don't ask.
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Who is it?
Yes.
What's your name?
Rufus.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Miracles do happen.
And this is William.
The movie star?
Yup.
No!
In a depressingly asexual way.
I never fancied you much actually...
Yes, I think that one may be.
That's nice.
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
No -- it's my 22nd.
Da Vinci?
Di Caprio.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
It was good.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
What's your name?
Ahm... Bernie.
Yes?
This is Henry James film?
Well, fire away.
Any bit in particular?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
That's right -- Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
Can I help you?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
She's perfect, perfect.
I believe I have.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Hi...
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
What?
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Why not?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
Three.
Oh.  Right.
Fabulous.
Yes.
Bad news.
What?
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Would you like to start?
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
Tell us about it...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
No! No! No!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
On this ward?
Right!
Go on...
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Thank you, ma'am.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Yeah, kid?
M-M-M-Mack?
Thank you.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Are they all crazies?
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
What for?
Atta boy, Cheswick!
Come here!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Hey, what's that?
Shhh...
Me, too...
Me too...
My feet hurt...
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
That!
With your own two hands?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, sucker.
Just warmin' up.
That's nice. Send me a post card.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I said out!
No!
I'm the coach!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Scanlon out!
No!
Why not?
Just wait till you hear...
Gary Blinker...
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
What's this?
That's a dime, Martini.
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
A nickel.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
Me too! Me too!
I'm hungry.
No.
What is it?
He's not!
He is!
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
I see.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Good. Good.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Time out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
No, 'fraid not...
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
You're breathin' right now.
What's going on?
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Yeah!
Shhh!  This way!
Okay. Who else?
Yeah, what's up?
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Just great!  See ya around!
To help you relax... please...
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Oh, yeah...
Yeah...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
He's in charge.
Are you a doctor?
Hi.
Big man!
Yes, ma'am...
After you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Asshole.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
You're a witness, Doc!
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Is everything all right?
Why, sure, ma'am...
What's that?
That!
Is he in an asylum?
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Of course not.
Your grandmother?
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Because.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Your great aunt.
No...
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
What's mezzaluna?
Okaaaaayyyy.
Hi there...
Thanks.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That was before I found out what it was.
I'm in love with you.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
If it's any of your business, yes.
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Please.  I need to know.
Mickey Spillane?
Or Hustler.
Hi.
Yeah.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Nice dress.
We were hungry.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
No.  Are you're leaving?
In that case... no...
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
Uh huh.
Beautiful place...
Just since yesterday.
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
You would?  Really?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yes?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Really...
And more...
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Oh.
So, what's your point?
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Is he married?
No.
Is he gay?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Why don't you ask him?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
No...  I can just tell.
It's a coincidence.
It's still the new year...
What about your job?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
What'd you find?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What is it?
A phone message.  Only--
Only, it's in Italian...
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
I never even got to be single.
What?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
...and a fortune teller.
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
What about Larry?
Kate.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Huh?
What?  You know him?
She didn't give me a chance.
Where is she?
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
What the hell!!!
I could have been better!
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Tommy, what happened?
Terry... Terry... .
What makes him so special?
None of your business.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'm with Terry.
I better see you get there.
You training to be a nun or something?
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
Oh she's a beauty.
I don't know.
It's quite—  –nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
Hit me again, Mac.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Go ahead, wear it.
Terry, what's wrong?
The Father. The Father.
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Get out of my way.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Pop!
I'll find you a priest.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Now don't give me a hard time.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You go to—
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
So help me God!
What about it?
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I'm just resting my feet.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah, really!
Raise a hand to me and... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
No.
No?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Hit me again.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
So-so, Johnny.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
My favorite little cousin.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
What do you mean?
I was only talkin' to her.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
Maybe I will— one of these days.
I do not joke in my proposal.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
In there.
It frightens me.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
What do you mean?
What can we do?
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Nothing is worth your life.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Of course I do.
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
It would seem so, Master.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Well then let us proceed.
For what!?!
You mean...!
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Without the snake, of course.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Who are you?
Thank you.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Just that she got away.
I'm a tourist.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Yes, she did.
Yeah, I did.
I get that feeling, yeah.
And who watches your back?
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
Shit.
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
They're in 7D.
You're gonna use a ram?
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
I could walk out of here.
Excuse me, Adele?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Nervous?
A little.
In my bag, in the car.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
I thought so, too.
Of course I am.
We still talk, though.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
I mean, romantically.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Who was it answered the phone?
None of your business.
How do we do that?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Those guys bother you?
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It smelled.
How far do we go with this?
Well, does it make sense to you?
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Outside Adele's.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I told you, I'm not going back.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
I see better with them on.
The backseat.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
The next time I walk into a bank.
You goin' right back to work?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
How are you, Richard?
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
For a time.
Meaning?
You busted out?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I'm freezing my ass off.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
It's a guy you know.
It's Richard Ripley.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
Right now, son.
How you know that?
I can tell.
I <i>was</i>...
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
What do you want?
I'm looking for Maurice.
You a lawyer?
He said he stayed here last November.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
It's a --
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
"Hey, yourself."
Huh.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I imagine you would've though.
It's possible.  Why?
I told you, he isn't here.
When's he due back?
That's right, just me.
Like a fag.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Still...
Where you been hiding, Dick?
Where the fuck is Foley?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
Are they dead?
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
No, I was.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yes Sir.
Where's that lizard?
What lizard?
What the hell happened to you guys?
No, like...
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Power dive!
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
What facts are those?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
So what are you saying?
Six P-40's.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Home of the brave.
I'm out of fuel!
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Yes you can.
From the air?
Hang on.
Y-Yes Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
Explain what?
Sorry to trouble you.
Win?
Yes'm.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
You too, 'Mam.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
Learn English, then!
Fook ya dooble!
Peggy Sue!
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Good—bye, Grandma.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Peggy Sue!
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato. 
Yeah. Like that.
Is this slow enough for you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
Charlie. About last nights..
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
I just can't trust you anymore.
How'd you know about that?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
I know.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
I'm trying.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I'll just set it right here.
Then hold me.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Touchy, touchy!
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
What, why?
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
Coffee and a donut.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
What a treat.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Open it.
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
How do you feel?
I'm excused.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
The house payments.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Maddy's party.
Way to go, Mom!
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
Why not? They're my favorite.
Rosalie Testa!
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
When do we start?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
What are you doing?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I suppose so.
It's been a few years.
You alright?
I'm going out, Dad!
I'm not hungry.
Anywhere but here.
Zowie.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
I'm not burying him here...
There's a better place...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
He was dead. You know he was.
Maybe it takes a while...
What do you mean?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
Right here, Mom...
In a word, Bob...
Charles is right behind me.
You'll never find it in the dark.
K-R-O-one.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
Drew!
I promise!
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
I'm not going to die.
Ready for what, baby?
No sweat, buddy.
Of course.
More than your friend. Family.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
About my blood work?
We're waiting...
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Continue.
Your... lover?
As in, the vegetable?
What?
Find a lawyer?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
Rayisha. Very nice.
No. They didn't fire her.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
It's me, you dork.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Not bad.
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
You're right.
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
Do you... pray?
What happens?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Thank you.
A good start.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Do you take risks?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Yes.
No. I can't really see it.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Is that a question?
Why are we going to do that?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Get real.
Uh.... No. Not really.
Get a life.
How many do you know?
Who?
Since when?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
On behalf of the defendants?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Dr. J.!
Andy, you don't want this.
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Lookit. Lookit!
<u>What</u>?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
Get out of our way.
One or two.
Audrey?
You sure you can keep --
As fast as you can.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
Just give me your hand.
I would try for them.
You barely know them.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Not sure. Ten?
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
Hey, me. Over here.
Big Evil?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
What?
Like my pistola.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Wha'?
<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Never said you were a hype, either.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Some prophet guy?
For now.
Riddick?
What?
Do what I say. Please.
And what about the cells?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
You mean....
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
I'm born-again.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Please...this solves nothing...please....
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Not staying in here another....
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Said "looks clear."
What if you're one of five?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What do you care?
So much for my cocktail hour.
What, it's broken?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
Neither do I.
Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
You didn't think so then.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Sustained.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I want her.
I'm for that.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
The Hunt Club.
To scare off humans?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Mind your tongue, madame.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Cease fire! Withdraw!
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
What is this?
A hearing.
Which one?
Second from the left.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
It's humiliating.
Where are they now?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Where?
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Says he can't walk.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
What?
Barnes comes from Hell.
'Lias come naturally.
Over here!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
No!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
And you, do you believe?
No... I move faster alone. 
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
...there's nobody.
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
You know what I'm talking about!
Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
You don't know.
No thanks?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Okay. You win.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
I didn't say anything.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
No thank you.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
There wasn't any plane.
Bad enough.
That's putting it mildly.
Quarter after one. Why?
Just who are you, anyway?
Dance? Here?
Why not?
We'll find out.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
No use waiting, then.
From you, I like it.
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
You leave it.
That, and the fun of it.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Do you think I was faking?
If I did-I don't-now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Right, Miss.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
That's an evasion and you know it.
I'm sorry.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Yes.
A graduation present.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
You must come from pretty far South.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Morning. Any calls?
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Got it on you?
Got the information on you?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
You, Killaine?
Leave that one lay.
So you're not a cop.
I've got good ears.
A private joke.
The usual grind.
If I can get off.
Well--good night.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
You'd be breaking the law.
Doesn't answer the question.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
I don't think you locked your door.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
You get it's brother.
So it seems Sergeant.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
I guess I'm just ballast around here.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Where's the shell?
Should be over there.
Oh nothing.
Warm water, no doubt.
Not quiet yet.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
It does.  May I go now? 
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
So far.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
The card says so, doesn't it?
Brandon handled the money envelope.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
How long have you had it?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
I told you she's just..
It's kind of you to see me.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
I see.
Of course.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Who?
Well, you know...
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Did she talk about me?
Might?
What did he want?
In your car
Why not.
To the airlift.
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes.  James is in love.
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
Come on.  Hand over.
You approve!
Let me see.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
Hello.
Suez.  1956.
They don't count.
Dad.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
You'd look naked without one.
Promise.
'Night.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
De nada.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
You do it... you first!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Okay!
But you're not alone.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy.
What?
Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Nice tattoo, Dietz.
This Zen master surfer.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Nothing.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
What?
Warm them up.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Who cares!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
No more games.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Right behind you.
Anytime.
I saw it.
It's been a long time, General.
I can't tell.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
He's not really my uncle.
They never are, dear.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Hope to be?
What?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
No.
Stolen?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
You're joking.
Fine.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
Exactly.
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Oooh, thank god.
Why?
Just a romantic, that's you.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
"Occupational hazard".
No shit.  They expensive?
What?  Why?
Vivian --
Of course.  How much?
Five full nights... days too?
All right, two thousand.
Done.
Holy shit.
I got a dress, yeah.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Any good?
I think you'll approve.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Good.
Come with me?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Dinner can wait.
He died a long time ago.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if I lose it?
I'll guard them and you with my life.
The opera.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
What do you mean?
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
It felt good.
No.
I'll bring it back.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Do it.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Doing what?
Vivian's in sales.
I'm up.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
He's not gonna want us.
Yeah.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Who did you think?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Dummy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I leave extras, miss.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
I... Edward...
Vivian.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
You'll like it fine.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
Excuse me?
I was in here yesterday.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Brides often are, I'm told.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
There will never be a need.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
What?
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, some of the time. 
True!
I don't think more than ten.
But you don't know where he is.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Have you any money?
I have a little.
Where did you get that?
What?
Open it up.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
I don't understand.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
It will not happen!
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Not yet.
Light him.
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Hah?
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
I am not left-handed.
No one of consequence.
Get used to disappointment.
That would be inconceivable.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Morons.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I will. And I choose --
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
Yeah, an hour.
A good hour. Yeah.
Think it'll work?
A little bit.
Guess what.
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.

You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Ooooooops.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
Well, sir, it seems ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
It's nothing ... nothing.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What was I saying?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.

We can't... we keep our money there!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
I told them we invaded England.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Groovy!
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
Very early. Dawn.
No one met her?
What do you mean?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Who are you, friend?
Money.
Must've needed it.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Forty thousand dollars.
Just what he told your detective.
Lila.
Is Mary here?
Where?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
What do you know about it?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Huh?
Is Mary... in trouble?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
She'll need both of us.
Where... can I stay?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
You'll never find it.
Contemplate your... panic button.
In a hurry.
Well?
Huh?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
Hospital clean.
What?
Bates.
I could stand something regular.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam. This is the last time.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I can come down next week.
All right.
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Sam, let's go get married.
You have a vacancy?
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Norman Bates.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
You'd know, of course.
I imagine so.
What are you running away from?
Why do you ask that?
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
Norman.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
That's it. 
Good night.
Is anything wrong?
No need to apologize...
Now what?
Please.
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
I didn't think so.
Leave me alone!
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Just before she died she came to--
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
I don't know, [I tell you].
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
I don't know--I can't tell--
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
But where do the rats come in?
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
He isn't here.
I'm going to call the police.
The wound is bleeding!
Go to sleep!
I'm losing my blood!
You're losing your blood?
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
What did it say?
Yes!
Yes, the child ...
Yes.
But ... the dogs...
No!  Good night!
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Well, I do say it.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
That's the way I feel about it.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
The body of Joan Gale!
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
What!
Almost certain.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir. About three months ago.
How's every little thing?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
That's the one.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Thanks.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
Darned if I don't! 
Oh, is that what caused it?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
He can't hear you.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Excuse me???
Yes....
Day or night?
I'm heading out of town.
That's the physicist's playground.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Is Rose here?
In what sense were they bad?
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But Rose...
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You're my sweetheart.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Yeah, he's still up there.
Daddy, what's the matter?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
What are they doing?
He kissed her.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Buddy, that was my place.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
So am I.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
A wonderful woman, boy.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Yes, we know her.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
What time is it?
Is she all right?
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
Fine.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
No, sir.
Well, good night.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
There are more on the other side.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Your baby?
No, you're not.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Galley what?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
She has other things to do, Dave.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
It'll get better now.
I don't mind.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
You're not gonna see him again.
Incestuous.
Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Abe Lincoln...
She's fine, as if you cared.
What'd I say?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Save it.  Just go.
No you can't.
Get ready.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Wh... what... ?!
The booze.
Entertainers don't count.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
What day is it?
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
No, but it should.
It's go time, Billy-B.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Can't you say something nice once?
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Can't I?
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Absolutely.
Slow down.
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You think this is so easy?
Can't be worse than you.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
Whatever goes bang.
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Just got here.
How'd we do?
Your wish is my command.
Know what I love about dynamite?
Keep 'em busy.
It's one of a kind.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't see.
Jabba's palace.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
The same as always.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
Lando!
Lower it!
I'm trying!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
You, too.
All right, hang on.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Come on! Come on!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Red Leader standing by.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Your Royal Highness.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Tell me.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
Your father?
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
But, why must you confront him?
I will not fight you, father.
I will not fight you.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Your father he is.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yes or no will do.
Oh. Well, yes.
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Oh don't be so shy.
You know this earth - this person.
Yes.
You're OK by me.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.

She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Does that bum have to say that?
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Move your shoulders down.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Cost ya a buck.
What's happenin' here?
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
You have my food in ya hand.
Do I have to pay juice?
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky.
Excuse me.
What'd you say?
...Screw you, yoyo.
What?
Stuff it, man!
Makes your breath like garbage.
Maybe I like garbage.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
Rice is a bum.
Think about it.
Yeah, sure.
Here's the card?
'Bout an hour ago.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Freak luck for sure.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Ya got heart.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Check the eyes, Ben.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Real good.
Damn! How's it look?
Would you keep goin'?
Yo, can I have my locker back?
It ain't your locker no more.
'Bout what?
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Ain't had time to check 'em.
What?
Ya always in a bad mood --
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't bother me none.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...Tight.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
To see ya train.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
You serve martinis, doncha?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
A tweeting bird?
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Check the scrawl.
R.K. Maroon.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Oh, no...
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
That's right, me.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Toon cops worked me over.
Does it hurt?
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
I didn't know who I could trust.
He's right here in the...
Eddie, come on.
Wait here...
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
So's the job.
Aren't you the lucky one...
As soon as is humanly possible.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Have you got the will?
That was the idea.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
Take it easy.
Aah!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
No, it's not.
I rest my case.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Tempt not a desperate man!
Romeo will answer it?
By my heel, I care not.
Is the day so young?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out--
Of love?
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Art thou hurt?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
He shall be endured
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Romeo, come forth.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well, what was yours?
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
A most courteous exposition.
Right.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
A Plague o' both your houses.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
You know it is.
Is that right?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
And I don't believe you...
That's why you were riding with him.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
I thought I did.
That's him.
You lose them!
Not yet...
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
You were a soldier, were you?
Is that right?
That's right.
Just business.
Bloody fucking hell...
I'd stake my reputation.
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
Shut up!
You first, Edvard.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Bad company...
In here...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
You'll die if you leave here.
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What's a little hate between business partners?
I swear...
Then where is it?
A post office box.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
There is one other thing...
Don't cross me...
Nobody's going to do that!
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Of course.  Don't you?
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
I didn't expect that he would.
Call it a reckoning of character.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Gets the job done.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Why don't you go do better, then...
My way is better.
Who's they?
Everybody.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
You should learn a little patience.
No thanks.
Let's just say he knows who I am.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Know what?
A lot of people died.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You don't have to do this.
You see the bullet?
I know of him.
Yes.
It is at that.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You were behind the door?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
I don't know...
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Business keeps you on the road?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
I think not.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Just like that?
Do you have a good answer?
I'll work on it...
And now...
Finish it!
Nothing...
Gone.  Destroyed.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Why didn't you kill him?
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
The Russian would be easier.
Don't lie to me!!!!
Sure thing, and --
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Oh, you would have done great.
Why?  Are you kidding me?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Hell, it won't be us!
Why?
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
Because...I know.
What's that?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Neither do I.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
It's gonna be o.k.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
No we're not.
Then Sally comes too.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He killed her...
It's NOT too late!
By Friday.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Hello.
Hi.
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Yeah I'm fine.
I love you too.
That son of a bitch.
I love you.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I swear to you, it's true...
You know I do.
What did he buy?
A week ago, at most.
Yeah.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
What are you getting at?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
Well I don't know...
Have I seen her?
Shopping here?
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
I don't know...
I can't hear a word you're saying!
That hasn't stopped you before.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Calm down --
Right behind you.
Well you're not getting, either.
I think I am.
I was in the neighborhood.
Is that the mail?
Money.
Not in the trunk.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
I'm not getting an answer.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
The band has been playing over an hour.
I got my sources.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I said get on your feet!
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
That's right.
No.  It's my first time.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Try to land on your feet.
How you doin'?
Don't look at my ass!
Who died?
You.
Not Yu.  You!
Who?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Forget it.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
How do you know?
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
What did you say?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars.
No.  It's not right.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
There's people up here!
Get it out of here!
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
It doesn't matter.
How was the sex?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Who's Benjamin?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
I'll give it my best shot.
MMMMMM!!!!
Just GO!
No problem.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
You take care of yourself, Lee.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
It's okay, I got lots more.
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
I need your help.
I'm fine.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
This is pathetic.
A little.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Witnesses.
What plate?
Did you make the plate?!
No. I just made it up.
What?
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yeah, it's good.
Yes, I know this song.
You know War?
Yes, I think so.
Going into the restaurant.
What do you hear?
What?
The art.
You know him?
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Where'd you get it?
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
It's okay. For restaurants.
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Carter, shut up!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
She's fine.
Yes.
It's Griffin.
Griffin?  Where are you.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
You bet ya, Coach.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
We'll rub.
He's here!... He's here!
"Nothing but net."
"Never say die."
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
All the gory details.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Then you'll be my best man.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Looking for Maggie.
No, she's talking about your hair.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You know, your daughter seems...
Really?
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
Done.
You afraid to try?
Still sweet.
You don't know.
No.
Of course.
No.  You take it.
Can you fix it?
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Missed me bad, huh?
Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
That was very interesting research George was doing!
A little longer for me.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
I love you, too.
So am I.
So, we'll...
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Yup!
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Lighten up, what?
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
I'm just finishing up, too.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
A harmless joke.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
I hate boats.
It sounds nice.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Am I what they had in mind?
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Happy New Year.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
I don't think so.
And then I'll see you in New York --
About forever.
No.
I do.
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
Look!
Whatever it is.
What's with you?
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No.
Yes.
Listen to this, I love this part --
What?
Is this crazy?
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
Good night.
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Made for each other.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I want my money.
Go home for the weekend.
Yes.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
Are his folks nice?
You know.
What?
You don't believe in signs.
Hello.
It's me?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Have you had any relationship since?
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I don't think I could really describe it.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
She died.
Why not?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Right, right.
You'll find out.
You'll see.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
My feelings exactly.
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
I'm starting to notice that.
Jed's got cables.
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
How do you know?
What was?
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Not now, Jonah --
Oh, right.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
I was thirsty.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
I just called for a second.
Victoria? She's okay.
The one who wrote us.
It might be in the kitchen.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
If I didn't go.
It was all they had.
What about it?
Hi.  Sam?
Hi.
You look good yourself.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
It takes time --
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
No thanks.
How's it going?
You haven't tried locking them up!
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It never ends.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
So much the better.
An American.
No, Estellita.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
What has it got me, your union?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
No, no ...
Antonio paid for it.
I did forget. Luís told me.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Sure.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
You weren't waiting for me.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
No.
No. New York.
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
My kids don't have enough to eat!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
Shhh.
The spiders.
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
How about in the house?
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Everything go?
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
That bad, huh?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Nothing.
Go ahead.
Why not?
You don't understand.
Trust me. We're safe.
Never heard of him.
It's the only way to play.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
What is wrong with you?
How much time do you have?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
Please open the door, Danny.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Find a new job.
I been that way ever since.
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
It's Tom.
Midnight?
Lead the way.
You don't say.
Finland is a country.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
No. I'm good.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
What does that mean?
Understand what?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Secret recipe.
Make me an offer.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
But I just met you.
I'm sorry?
Big Bill.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Okay! Okay!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
You go, boy.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
It's not my place.
Tell me what?
Question is, what are you doing here?
I was trying to score some dope.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Who is it?
It speaks!
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
The Mexicali Boys
He's the only one I told.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
They have. But they never found a lab.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
I was talking about Miles.
And you've got wiener breath.
There's no motels around here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
What do you mean?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Just admit you're wrong.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Better than drugs.
Don't worry about it.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
I thought you were done.
...alright, let me know when.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
Of course, sir.
I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
What deal?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Keep trying.
To each, his own.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Pass.
Sarge?
You think the rest of us were?
I heard.
It seemed appropriate.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
A machine gun.
Same place we are.
Sure, you got one?
I changed my mind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Fresh out.
What about Talbot?
I've got a line on one.
Yep, hell of a mission.
PUSH!
Uh, Captain...
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Good news?
You never know.
It doesn't take this.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you take your position?
You want me to take over?
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Get back to your positions!
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Alright, come with me.
Yes, sir.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Lingerie.
Captain, he's fast!
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Who knows?  It worked.
Twenty-four-five.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Speak with my lawyer.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
And your former wife.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'll take the whole set.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
You're sure?
Hey, sis.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
I still am.
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
I'll be home soon.
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
Lloyd, give it up.
C'mon Lloyd.
Please?
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
See you tomorrow.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
I admit nothing.
Read it.
Come on, it's graduation.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
What is wrong with this girl?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can put that together.
I'll put this past my boss
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
I love you dad.
I love you too honey.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Goodnight.
Okay, I give up.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
I like him a lot.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Just finishing up in here.
Swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hi.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
You will?
Look at those eyes.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.  What a day.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
No, I read it on the message.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Are you busy on Saturday?
Well, not monumentally.
Pardon me?
I'll go.
Goodbye.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
You know what?
What?
Job?  Being a great date.
No, I'm serious.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Then call me tomorrow.
Then call me later.
Yeah?
Mmmm.
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
Well... just meet her.
Yeah.  With potential.
Friends with potential.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
You're cold.
Then why are you shaking?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
Why didn't you tell me?
It was wonderful.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
How can I look at you and say this?
You need to study?
Yeah, uh-huh.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Just my dad.
You told your dad?
Oh shit.
What do you want?
What?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
The truck?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
I know
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
Your car?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Lloyd.
What?
Hey.
How you doin', brother?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I love you too.
Yeah, alright.
Sir, the list is correct.
What -
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
War.
It's a beautiful city.
It's up to you.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
You did, but you didn't.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Look it up.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
You're a good man.
Things are great, things are great.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I need a drink.
Ah, yes.
I think it's too late.
No, no, what, what is it?
You did so much.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Take the neighborhood.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
They've broken their pattern.
Don't. Think Bailey.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
That's smart.
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Who is this?
Cici. Who's this?
What if I said goodbye?
Why would you wanna do that?
No, it's me.
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Can we talk?
You could start with an apology.
Not until you’re dead.
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
The forbidden subject.
I'll get my jacket.
I think it's out of your control.
No. This is a set up.
You’re not going to get away with this.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
Randy somebody.
I got it..
I find his work overwrought.
Tuition’s expensive.
Miss Weathers.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I never meant to imply...
Yeah?
What are we looking for?
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
We'd break some furniture.
And Joel's pre-med.
Let's find out.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Humor me, Sid.
I'll give you one guess.
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm everywhere.
Stay away from the cop.
It's what you want from me.
Watch your back.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Oh my God.
Where is your attacker?
I don’t know.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Is Sid in therapy?
Hello?  Hello?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
Yeah, right.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
Easy black boy.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
I just love being a sister.
Gale?
But she's standing right next to you.
But...
Now.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
He's after me.
Where you going?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Hello.
Who is this?
Asshole, Can't talk.
What kind of a game?
Good bye Ben.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Closer than you think.
Reaction to what?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
There's more.
Absolutely.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Catch him, or kill him.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
The killer called her.
What?  When?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where are you Dewey?
They've got her!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
You used to say that was our strength.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Always.
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Need to get in that building?
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Who's this?
Who's this?
I'm hanging up right now.
It is in my script.
My movie.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Go there.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Yeah...
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Where the fuck did she go?
You rode your bike out there?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
Yeah... I think so.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Stop it!
Who is this?
What number is this?
So why did you dial it again?
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
What's that noise?
You're making popcorn?
Uh-huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Just some scary movie.
Do you like scary movies?
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What do you think I said?
Don't hang up on me.
Don't...
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
No-bored.
They'd never make it in time.
So you better leave.
Guess.
That all depends on you.
Why are you doing this?
Which is it?
Come on. It'll be fun.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on, yes you do.
I can't think.
YES!
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Then answer the question. Same category.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Answer the question and I will.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
I'll get my camera.
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Yeah.
Should I be worried?
How is everything?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
He's her boyfriend.
What were you doing out here?
How is she?
She's tough.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Call the police.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
About thirty seconds.
I'll send you a copy.
Just stay back.
I owe you shit.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
Your front porch.
Right here.
What am I doing?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello Sidney.
I heard screaming.
No you didn't.
...so call if you need me.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
She's saving herself for you.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Like you had one.
Yeah.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
It's all part of the game.
The official term is "psychotic".
You'll never get away with this.
How do you gut someone?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Later.
Bye.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
It's alright. I'll get it.
I bet he's pissed.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I did. He's full of shit.
How's that?
I'm in.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
No, I haven't heard.
There was a second.
Good.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
Her pretty head.
You'll see.
A woman...
Murderers like you?
You should be thanking me.
And, why is that?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I realize that.
For now.
No one yet.
Guessing at this point is useless.
Can we talk about this in private?
What?
Tonight.
What about them?
I read.  Remember reading?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
We put her in a safe house.
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Call an ambulance.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
Oh, it's alright.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yes we do.  Here...
I don't know... like fifty.
I don't.  Neither do you.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
I'm fine.
What happened?
It was him.
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
Think about how we got here!
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Where's the victory?
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
Give me a break.
Wait!
What did you say?
I can't let you do this...
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
I can't do this now... please.
What?
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't sleep very well.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
How should I know?
But Mose Harper said...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
By what you preach...none!
Captain Clayton...Captain!
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Told ya, didn't I?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You got it with you?
I beg your pardon?
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night...
Whatchu doin'?...
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
Nine...  Ten!
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Not far from it...
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
We got two around that age...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
I mean the armchair!
Oh, damnit!
Do you have a better idea?
I'll do it myself.
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Someone from the village.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Does this dog here belong to you?
Do I look like it that much?
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I've killed my husband!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
We should leave the past alone.
Very funny.
Right you are, governor!
You have the last act?
You have the money?
Twenty pounds on delivery
No Juliet?!
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
You're a liar.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Nothing comes.
Most interesting.
No, no. You have a wife, children
No, your marriage bed.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
There's never any
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
Yes, but very well.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Thomas Kent!
Every word.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Romeo.
What do we do now?
The show must … you know
Wonderful, wonderful.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
A different one you haven't written?
"Is the day so young?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
"Of love?"
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
I am not so well-born.
Stand up straight, girl.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I have, Master Shakespeare.
But the plague
I'll be damned if you are!
Who is there?
Will Shakespeare!
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
You can bring them with a word.
Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a player?
Even your play.
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first. 
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
It was the owl--come to bed
Mr. Henslowe?
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I must. I must
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
How does it?
My lord.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
My hat?
Wait there.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
Do you understand me?
No, sir.
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
It is only ours you can know.
Does she say so?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
A man, my lord?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Will you shut up and play.
I haven't lost yet.
About what?
I don't have time.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Think about it.
No.
No.
Juliet?
And what about you?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I don't hear this.
I won't be able to.
But not quite.
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
Not now. I have an idea.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
I don't know.
Security.
There was a break-in.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Nothing.
You're not eating.
Not eating what?
Looking for you? Yes.
Your friends.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Where do you think you'll go?
Well?
But there's no --
Don't know what?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
What?
Parked outside?
That's all?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
What?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Yes.
Really?
Just serve.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
Yeah.
You're right.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
So I gathered.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Open it.
Now?
Yes.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
Don't look?
Unfeasible.
Is that all?
I don't thinkI can.
And now you tell me.
David?
For ever and ever.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
That's not him.
Who was it?
Don't you?
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
We could put it somewhere.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
No.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I refuse.
You're frightened.
I'll wait there.
What?
We were just sorting things out.
The perfect couple, I should say.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
I see.
What?
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
Of course.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Would you like to talk about it?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds?
Two hundred pounds.
What?
Who have you talked to?
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
It was on the television.
You and me?
Here.
Right here?
In this firm.
Exactly what I was --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
I'm not sure --
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That one, last week.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
Would you like to come in?
A priest who dies.
I see.
It's a breeze.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
All right.
Did he sound upset?
I'm a doctor.
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
I write about it?
And that's not the same thing?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Is it real?
Or a fake?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
My keys.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
Yeah, I think so.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
But you don't know what happened.
Nummers.
What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Whatever you say.
Yes.
What about?
I don't know. Just a minute...
Hello, George.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
That headboard.
Nobody can hear it.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Are you?
Hello.
A little.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Did you hear me?
Gee, this is great.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Don't make conversation with me.
That you're just like your mother.
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
You are.
Yeah.
How is she?
She is.
Right, that's right.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Yeah.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
You going to tell him?
Well, I do.
I'd cut it...
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
No, I'm sure.
Yeah... I mean great.
What's wrong?
It's hot in here.
Why not?
And what?
Did you?
Did you?
Did I what?
Hey, I don't tell.
Yeah, baby...
You're a genius.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
He's a director.
Jackie, can we --
Fuckin' A --
-- what?
I am you, you little bastard.
He never stopped.
We're friends.
Nothing.
Look who's talking.
Me?
-- do you want ice?
-- we are?
-- you've got to leave.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
It's too late...
Don't go, Jackie...
Oh yeah?
Wash her.
What with?
-- Otis?
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- took a bus.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
Okay... thanks...
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
What're you talking about?
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
You said somebody... who?
Keep moving --
Now, George --
Fine. How are you?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Yeah.
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Yeah, baby.
Why am I great?
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
You've never even been around one.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
What!
Could I?
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
I already said hello.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Your advice!
I want your feelings about it.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I'll call you.
Where's your car?
A friend dropped me off.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Television or movies?
Commercials.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
What is.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Yes.
Where did this come from?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
What difference does it make?
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Stop it.
Did you?
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
No?
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
Yes it is.
But what?
When?
What about, tonight?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
... this doing hair it's...
What do they look like?...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
But...
What can I say!
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
I wanna hear it from you!
Why, why do you think that is?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
No thanks.
Have a drink.
Okay, thanks.
What about her?
Lester, it just happened.
She's nothing but a whore.
Yes I do.
I'm finished with her.
Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

Awww --
Come on by.
I'll call you back...
Okay, okay...
Yeah.
I'll call you back.
What do you mean?

A daytime soap opera.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Yes.
No kidding? Your own shop?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
That's not very logical, Lester.
You're still jealous.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Why not?
Jesus, she's my best friend.
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
You know what's wrong.
Jackie, what're you doing?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
Fine.
Anyway, you're crazy.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Well, what is it, honey?
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
How much?
Jackie --
What?
It's been so long I don't how long?
What?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Sure.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Sort of.
-- never mind.
Good for you.
He's a hairdresser.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
I don't think so.
-- oh I don't know --
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
You're going.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
That's fine --
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
-- just wonderful.
Do you have children?
Are you married?
No.
John...
Everybody but us.
Where to, Les?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes?
I'm hungry.
They had to, in order to survive.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Yes?
What?
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Try to think what it was.
Room 237?
Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah.
Yes?
I won't make any noise.
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Danny!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Yes, I'd like you to.
Thank you.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That's right, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
A nigger.
A nigger!
A nigger cook.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Nice to meet you.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Pleasure to meet you.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
It's about eleven thirty.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
No, nothing at all.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Good.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away...!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Get down.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Yes?
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Great...
Well, my predecessor in this job
Well, that is eh quite a story.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
Jesus.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Let me help you up.
Went shopping. Why?
Will you?
Well... it is his third.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Do I need one?
Good.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What the hell does that matter?
Well... was it a prescription?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
I think they hear you!
Yes, Mary?
HE'S SO FINE...
Were you tempted?
SING!
And I'm tearful!
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
With love.
What?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Yes?
Thanks.  A lot.
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
HE'S SO FINE.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
I know.  It's ancient.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
That man -- who is he?
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Whatever.
Um, I don't really know this one...
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Tell me about it.
Amateurs 2
Babies
Again!
Sing!
What?  What time is it?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
A novice.
Now you.
Experience!  Right?
You watch yourself!
Keep moving!
Mary Clarence!
Experience!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Again?
Bless you.
It's true!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
You were unhappy?
What?
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
And all those like you.
You mean black people?
Check your driver's license.
The vow of obedience.
Like to who?
I'm outta here.
Your cell.  Your room.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
The majority has spoken.
Good day.
Saving you.  Move!
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Then-you run.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You're not... seeing anybody?
Even nuns have to pee.
Hail, Mary.
But -- wait.
They open a window.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We didn't tell you what?
I'm telling you!
Take care of it.
Not... totally.
What's the problem?
Which one!
Which one?
Willy -- hit the lights.
Where is she?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
Neither did you!
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
Yes?
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's kind.
It's better than springtime.
It's brought people back to the church.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
She wasn't a nun?
But how do we get there?
Impossible.
Yes?
I know. 
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Find 'em!
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
To place it inside its coffin.
What is that?
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
Look again.
What kind of nuts?
Witches do not exist.  However...
Listen.
I hear nothing.
What happened?
Stay back.
Why this tree?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
What was she doing?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
Tired.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
It was not butchery.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
But, why?  Tell me why.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
I apologize if I worried you.
Just... keep where you are.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Come with me.
He moves too fast.
His horse.
We have no choice.
Use caution.
What did you say?
Turn around.  Now!
In a way, yes.
Sit.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Father saw you die.
No.
You got any money?
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
How are you, Bill?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
You have any biscuits for sale?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Well, I guess it's all good.
What do you like to eat here?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
It went real good.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I thought I told you to keep out!
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
What's all them books?
You believe in the Bible?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
How come?
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I like the way you talk.
I like the way you talk.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Why?
A boy or girl?
A little ol' boy.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
It was fun, anyhow.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I ain't got no boy.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Yes sir.
I didn't aim to.
Well, okay. I got you some.
Yeah.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What's that you say?
Why are you here now?
Not really to speak of.
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
I'm sorry.
Why won't he talk to women?
Actually, I'm his father.
Better make it charge. 
And your father? Is he from New York?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Do me a favor, will you?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
It's yours?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
You usually get two.
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
Yeah, probably.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I mean, it's a good story.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
And what's that supposed to mean?
She looks just like you.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No, bully for you.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
And why the hell would you give me money?
So I can get my job back.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
It'll never be finished.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
What can I do for you?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
I figured he had a right to know.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
Say hi to Paul.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well what?
What do you want me to say?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
In Manhattan?
Of course. Where else?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Where did you get that thing?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
It's all right. I really do know them.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Fries?
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
You don't.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
I said.  No further questions.
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Why?  We're only talking.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Won't take two.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
You're right.  I better use two.
You're wondering why I held it.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
I think you like learning.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Yes.  And that one, too.
Get lost, will you?
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
What did he say?
Of course I am.
We're not?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
With you.
With me?
We're not too late, are we?
They got the bull-fiddle.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
And I'm Daphne.
Done what?
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Have I got things to tell you!
I'm engaged.
WHAT?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Like what?
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What?
Get me Room 414.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
There you go with that we again.
Terribly sorry.
I'll say.
See you around, girls.
Good night, honey.
Honey - she called me honey.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Anything wrong?
No, no.
Isn't that ridiculous?
I'm a very sick girl.
I have a very low resistance.
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Thank you, Daphne.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Oh yes, we do!
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.
I always did.
Oh - here and there - and around.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
What's the big idea?
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
- and you got to be girls.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You must be quite a girl.
Goodbye?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
About that roadhouse -
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
Come one!
Flower girl.
You ain't going nowhere.
We won't breathe a word.
It's three weeks in Florida -
It's not the backs that worry me.
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
I'll say.
Every time!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Would you mind terribly?
Not at all.
Good night, Sugar.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
My fault.
I don't think so.
I wish you'd make sure.
Who are you?
Now, really -
Well, I'm not.
That's very interesting.
Up, up, up.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
- opening of the Opera -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Guess!
They repealed Prohibition?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
What is it?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
It's the crews' night off.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Good morning.
Let's make it an even million.
Did you have a nice time?
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
We got different information.
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
You shave with your spats on?
I sleep with my spats on.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Except it’s Scotch.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
I’m fine. I promise.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Why, with you.
Oh, don’t be that way.
No, that’s not it.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Hello, Katmandu.
Yeah?
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Kat.
What does your gut say?
You’re too good for him.
It’s cute.
What is?
A wedding.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Shampoo, got it!
What?!
What do you think?
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
Yeah.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Hi.
I have to.  I’m the best man.
I’m so sorry.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Meet Nick.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
Is there any other way to take it?
That does it...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What he talk 'bout?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
Go on...
Can you swim?
Yes mam...

Hi, Daddy...
Hi to you, son...

He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
You bet we is!
Goodnight to you, son...
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
What's that, son?

Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
Children, come here...
No mam -- I looked all over.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
He can't get up, Mama!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
Mornin'...
I'll wait till after the children.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
I am the clitoris.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Pillow.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
I said -
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Very funny!
How the fuck should I know!!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
What?
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Whoops.
No way.
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rm rmph!!
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Eric?
I don't know.
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Oh no, it's that kid.
This is the place--
What?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Baba mama!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I don't know.
Uhh... Bacon.
FREEZE!!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Kay.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We can't leave without you!
It's okay, I am done for.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
It isn't fair!
How do we do that?
Totally!
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
-Or monkey fucker-
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
Right away, ma'am!
What the hell is going on?!
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
Cheers, Terrance!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
You would know, dummy.
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
I am.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
No! It can't be!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
And ze rope?
Check.
He's shutting off the air!!!
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Anna...
It can't be.
Excuse me?
You're Warren Wayne.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
They are awaiting further information.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
Well shut it off at once!
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I can hardly wait.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
That's me.
I know, I know.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
That's clear.
Over and out!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Will you shut up already?
Just don't move around too much.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Seen one like it before?
Close every door behind you!
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Helllp!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
What?  What are you talking about?
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
Over and out.
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
And so far.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Marry you?
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Send it back if you don't want it.
How am I supposed to know?
What makes you so sure?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
What kind of man?
A bowler.
It belonged to my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
What do you want with old man Faz?
Lemme see your ball.
When you get a chance.
I hate fuckin' opera.
No kiddin'.
I'd buy it!
See ya 'round Faz.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Wish me luck.
Theo.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You wish!
He says that to all his wives.
Hello, mom?
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Junior.
Junior who?
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Leave him alone!
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm a bowler.
They suspended me.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
He's no father to you.
The Peter Pan.
Whips...orange whips.
Coming right up.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Where did your brother escape from?
What does he do?
No, not at all.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
No. Not at the present.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
We'll get into that later.
Why were you suspended?
What's plan B?
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Plan C...  ...is me.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Come on, bargain with me.
I could let them go for ten.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
It's Junior, isn't it.
Tell me what happened Theo.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
I feel sick.
You should.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
At least I'll die smiling.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Fuck plan C!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Suck my dick!
Lips still for sale?
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
I can't...
Back away then.
I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
What is it?
How about I just press the button?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What was that?
Fifty yards and closing.
What do we use for defense?
But you've tested it?
He's right beneath us.
That's our reserve air.
Do you see it?
Now!
Pull it, damn it!
Nothing else.
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
A thousand feet.
Then why am I here?
Maybe older --
It's impossible.
What's wrong with oxygen?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
I think I do.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
You don't think weapons are important?
Jerry?
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Nothing, sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
In the ship, sir.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
Yes, Harry.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
How do you mean, strange?
What -- you want me to retype it?
She wired this system.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What are you going to do -- shoot her?
What is it?
Radiation shield, you think?
Sir, about leaving --
Internal power.
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
What's inside the sphere.
Resetting the sub.
What sub?
That's quite a secret.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
The library.
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
What?
Beth --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Eggs.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Don't tell me to calm down!
Don't do this.
You bastard.
I have to reset the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
We must've had it delivered then.
None of this was here before.
You don't believe me.
What?
I don't know.
Something for burns.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Ulcers.
Sintag.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Bingo.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What's that?
Causes sleep.
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
How fast does it take effect?
Beth --
For what?
Not believing you.
What do you mean, different?
I'm feeling better.
Are you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
Are you manifesting them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
No, he can't.
You're lying --
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Is it?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Get away --
It doesn't make any sense.
Who says it's a he?
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
In time for what?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
I'm fine.
No, why don't --
Look, would you --
To what?
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Gimme another explanation.
No.  I didn't say that.
Then what, Norman?
It's like...
What are you still doing here?
You remember opening the door?
Then explain it to me.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Harry?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Beth left?
Wisconsin?
How do we decode it?
That's right.
Stop what?  What are you -- ?
I don't think so.
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
I heard!  I heard!
Well, press something!
Wait!
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Is it?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Thank you.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The others, sir?
Beth and Harry?
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
You've heard of me?
Huh?
What report?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Squint harder.
Try this one.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Not that I know of.  Why?
I don't know.
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
I'm not afraid of anything...
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
I'll make a report later.
Was this trip really necessary?
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
Why didn't you say so before.
I think I did.
No need, everything's under control.
With four casualties?!
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
I read you sir.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
You rich kids... are all the same !
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
YAAAAAAAA !
Death to all bugs !
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Others are waiting.
You got it bad.
I got Games & Theory.
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
I'm getting better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
It looks like an... asteroid.
Excuse me...!
A funeral.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
It's all I think about anymore.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
How do I know if this is love ?
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
You two have so much in common.
I can't help it.
He's nothing like you.
Who cares ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
You don't look very happy to see me.
That was just a mix up.
Thank you, ma'am.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
How come we never got together ?
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
You're the best.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Flip six, three hole.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
You used to dance...
What ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Looks like rain.
This time of the year...?
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Oh, is that how it is ?
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Doesn't look like it to me.
Hi, mom.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You can never be sure.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Move out.
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
What is it, Rico ?
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Who's that with you ?
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Yes, sir !
Cover us, Ace !
The Creator has not answered.
<U>Answer</U>!
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
It's taken control of the computer...!
It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
A tractor beam...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Decker....!
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Twelve seconds...!
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Ten seconds....
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters at station keeping...
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
And whatever you sensed out here....
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
We're ready, sir.
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
You bringing your new friend?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You bet your life.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
"Anguish."
You quit.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
It's about life.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
...that.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
About <u>conflict</u>...
Yes.
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Cast stood me up.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
"Room Service!"
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
One moment.
Read the card.
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
Why?
Go you Huskies!
I can't get it to come out right.
I hurt you?
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
Going home.
Gosh, you look nice.
It does?
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah.
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
After Drama Group.
Drama Group?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
We did...?
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
He works on the movie.
No.  Don't tell me that.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
What're you doing here...?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
...why am I here...?
Now: I'm looking at the...
They think it's your First Wife...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Nothing happened.
Isn't he...
It's...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
Bourbon and Milk.
How old are you?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
We've got three days to...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
What I...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Could I see it please...?
If there's anything I...
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
I, uh...  Um...
Who is it raped you?
We know that you weren't.
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I, actually yes.
I love Jewish men.
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
Who is that...?
That's my...
Oh.
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
You can't do what?
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Who are these from?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
...wants a piece...
Yes.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I'm only trying to...
Bob are you alright...?
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Well.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug, this is Mr...
What is the...?
Arrest him.
He didn't have to tell...
Later for you, pal.
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
A witness to what...?
The writer.
He saw the accident...?
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I grew up on your mov...
Where have you been...?
Why?
I don't getcha.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I left that for you.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
How was your flight?
They're coming Fedex...
What's in all the bags?
Find the money.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
We don't have the money.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
Why would they be illegal?
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Yes, I hear it.
It takes all kinds.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Givvem a cigarette...
...we can't lose the wind...
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
I killed her!
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
It happens.
Why does Rachel scream?
During sex.
I live.  In the same country.
Because it feels really incredibly good.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well.  It's for you.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
Not with my mouth open.
Oh, yeh.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Don't. Take me with you.
Good.  That's very good.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
No.  I think it's ugly.
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
That's my girl...
Don't take my picture!
Annabelle put down that camera.
You owe me a quarter.
Cos she loves you.
Then have a donut --
Alright starve.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I knew where I was all the time.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
How do you know?
I helped.
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
You say that like I don't know that.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Let's take our best shot.
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.
We're not discussing your age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Me too.
Good...Well...Take care.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
And I'm supposed to care.
WE are over.
And we all went through that together?
I live or I die.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You got to hell!
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I did it for her.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Yes?
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Don't flatter yourself.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
How the hell would you know?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
See, I know that.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
And you said...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Don't be too sure.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
I trust you of course I do but --
They don't hate you --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
I think so...What do you think?
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Because you've changed so much.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
He isn't.
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Oh.
Thanks, Scoob.
He was in a concentration camp?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Great to be here.
Yes, Mikey?
Four brothers and five sisters.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
I'm still poor.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
But really, you never know.
For rape and murder.
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Yes, Mikey?
Ready for tomorrow?
What's tomorrow?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but –
Just the same.
Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hi, Dad!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
Can I join you?
Thanks.
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Who is this?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
How many?
Eight, six, and four.
OK. Bye.
Thanks.
I know.
Is it loaded?
No, I don't think so...
Yeah. I know.
I mean...
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
We're outta here--
We don't have time!
What do you think?
Yeah?...
There's the fence...
You're talking about committing suicide!
Well Cooper...
Even better.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
Are you going to kill us?
I don't want any...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Agreed--let's move it.
We can't--it's power driven!
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
There's enough in one vial...
Moffo!
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
I know nothing of the sort!
Give that back to me.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What did you say?
General Schmuck?
What did you say, sir?
What kind of trouble?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
This is General Ripper speaking.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
To peace on earth.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
But we can't communicate with the base.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
Maybe it's an exercise.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
War.
War?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
They must have made a visual contact.
They can't touch us at this height.
Hang on, boys.
Primary arming switch.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Shoot, Lothar.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master Kong.
He's dead.
What happened?
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Like hell it does.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
I don't get you, King.
I said that's the point!
I'm okay.  What's up?
But I get a red light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Was it okay?
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Yes.
Typical male.
Typical male.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
A cloud?
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Where are you-hoo?
Shut up! Aw...
Yeah.
The dude wants it.
Jesus Christ.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
A long, long, long...
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
No, I'm not worried.
Hey, you know me.
Uh, last night...
You know?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Wait. Hey, man.
Look.
Hey, man.
She's in the van.
She's dead.
She's dead?
No, no, no.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Yeah, right, publicist.
Come on.
Play it! Come on!
Really?
Hey.
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm. And your like, what else?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
In what way?
Alright, Pony!
I'm so burnt-out.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
You better! Yes!
I will.
This is private property, my friend.
Glad it's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
No, no, whoa!
I could.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah!
A reel?
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Come on. Inside.
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
He is.
He is.
A Porsche.
Mm.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-mm.
It's a mistake to think that.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
I'm sorry.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Funny shit, man.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Uh-huh.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
That chick, Erica?
Well, w-what happened?
I hit her.
No.
This is my home.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
Look, your trespassing.
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I know, I know, I know.
I hate that.
Yes.
So you can give me more shit?
About what?
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
One!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Typical male.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
Yeah.
I would've stopped it.
Us.
And?
Come with me.
Mm-hm.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
I, yeah.
Mm.
Wait, away?
Shit, Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
You're unbelievable.
Oh, fuck it, man!
Go.
What?
Just go.
Yeah, good.
So how's college?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah.
For a while.
What do you mean?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I don't know.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
Oh!
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
Like?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
You done?
If...
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Yep.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
Oh, my god!
Really? What else does your mother say?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Cleo!
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Positive.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I sure do.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Oh... What are you working on?
You sure I'm not fat?
He Ikea'd us.
Yeah, hold on.
Kim-Lo?
Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Bullets.
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Bank branch!
All of you!
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Action! The scene starts.
Let it ride for a while.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
It's from hunger.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Thanks.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Well....
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
So long.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's who?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
You did.
Whose house is it?
Whose?
Hello, Mr. deMille.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Who else ?
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
What month?
December twenty-first.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
You can stay here.
I'll come early tomorrow.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
What's wrong with It?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Come on!
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
The other guests?
"Mad about the boy."
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
They're awful.  They make me cough.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are your...?
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
I think I'll read a little.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Dressed for what?
For me?  Okay.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Is that so!
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
That's what I told them.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
The doctor suggested it.
What doctor?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
That's right.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Yes.  Madame.
Who?
Paramount studios.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
No, a super girl.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
It's for your own protection.
I have to.
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Tell me where I can find her.
Why not ?
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
Terrific.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
But why?
But I don't understand.
I'm not mad at you.
It seemed that way to me.
I don't see why not.
But what if---it wasn't real?
She'll forget about us eventually.
What?
How do I fight it?
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hmmm?
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Well, just one.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
I've got things to do.
What about my proposal?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
Why didn't you tell me?
You're supposed to guess.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
I allowed it to escape the City.
As brave as my father. As wise.
This is all your clothes?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You're not...an orphan are you?
She's a beast.
Must've been a defective puck.
It was just a trim.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You're wasting your breath.
Cheap but effective.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Criminals.
But it's impossible.
Why?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Better than when I was a child.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
What? What did you tell me?
A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
Oh...I came close once.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Old ties are hard to cut.
Uh-huh.
Well, aren't you excited?
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
We get together sometimes.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Nope, but --
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
One.  And a half.
Say what?
I don't think you understand.
Columbia.
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
What are you talking about, fella?
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
Huh?
Fair's fair.
What do you want?
A computer.
We've already got some.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What she call you?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
What about you?
Anytime.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
But the bridge...
Tell me.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
But the other night...
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Missing????
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Storms! Floods!
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
We can get to work on that oil!
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Yeah. I'll check.
She'll be fine.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Be my guest.
In July???
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, I . . .
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm listening.
Let's go to my place.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Oh, hi.
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Everything on it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
Good. My heart can't take it.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
I think he said a "curl."
North.
Why?
To ski?
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
Cuba.
Put down Lex Luthor?
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
And I will lead.
What shall we do now?
Stay. I will come to you.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Clark. . . !
Any more like you back home, Clark?
I'm sorry.
Yes, darling?
Stuff it.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Our other dinner guest.
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
You're just an experiment, freako!
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
This wasn't in the plan.
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
I am master now.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
Shut up, apple-polisher.
You're a great architect, Albert.
A hot story, huh?
I will.
No.
Not...gray.
Not really, no.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it's swell.
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
I just took a shot at it.
Not unless you can fly.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Jealous? Of what?
Of this...Superman.
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
He's from another world.
Tough guy, huh?
You're on.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
Bingo!
La de da da...
What do you suggest, my dear?
Ready.
You?! How about me?
There was a recipe on the back  --
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What are you going to do to him?
Lex is going bye-bye.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
Of course I can. I love you.
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
How good it felt!
How good it felt -
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I guess they are a little odd.
It's not bad.
How old are you?
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Very much.
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
Otis...
It is for me.
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
And garbage doors.
Ally.  That's right.
How are you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
Which clinic?
But you said...
It turns to steaming piss.
That's okay.
Alison.
I will.
I'll tell her that.
No you don't.
They just finished supper.
Was it good?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
The children.
She's resting.  In her room.
Say hello for me.
No.  It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
It's natural.
Your kids never cry.
Good night.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
I have to.
Why?
Well I don't.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?

From what?
And what's that?
With our hands.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
Yes.  He does.
Billy said that?
I did.
Excuse me?
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
From you?
It's like a song.
What, Mason?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Thank you, Nicole.
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
People who will help our cause.
Crafts?
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
Yes.
What for?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Poached salmon.
You can't come here.
Please.
Yes.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Really?
Of course.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Does it fit?
Pretty slick, eh?
Very slick.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
You don't know that.
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Thanks, I see him...
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
We're on our way there now...
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
I see you're full of human feelings...
Is it news to you?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
I have a message from your sister.
You print them, don't you?
When?
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
He means that much to you...?
I read your column every day...
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What does that mean - integrity?
Talk to her yourself...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
At the bar - Sidney...
And where was his wife?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
This sort of thing!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
But what?
I hate to see you like this --
Nothing...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Why not you?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Why did you call me?
Let me try mine.
No way!
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Liquid metal.
Radical.
I would.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You told me to.
That is one of my mission parameters.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
No problemo.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Drive faster.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Where you going?!
Terminated.
Yes.  Throw it in.
Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
Gimme that Phillips right there.
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Ready.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
So do you.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
No.  There is another chip.
Yes.
On Furtwängler.
I don't know.
And no elbows on the table!
Eating is eating... and...
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Your manner.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I have a duty.
What's in those files?
I don't buy that.
It's the truth.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I was warned.
Who warned you?
I wish to say something.
Go ahead, be my guest.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Von der Null?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
How could I forget?
Show you?
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
So. You wanted to see me.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
One of my people?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
You know your weapons, buddy.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Don't wear the beige one.
I thought you did.
You must have a girlfriend.
Aha!  Is she young?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Freezing.
Come here.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
About what?
About where you're from.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
I want it to be over for you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  Never.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
Oh, Kyle.
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Of course.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I just called.
Call her again.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Oh, no... you.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
I don't know... he fell.
I don't think he's breathing.
This can't be real...
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
What... is... happening... ?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
You should be.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Where are you going?
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Please...
My hero.  Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
Yes... well...
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Can we talk?
It's okay, dad.
Is this you?
Where'd you get this?
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
Get out.
I didn't say anything.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
I don't know.  A lot.
What do we do?
What... what do you mean?
It's out of your hands.
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out!
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
Guess you missed it.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Let me show you...
I have to show you...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Happy Birthday, man.
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
You need anything?
No.
You shouldn't have.
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Call them.  Trust me.
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
How do you know?
You're part of it...
What?  Connie...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Yeah.
Split it?
Yes.
I hope.
I'll call.  I really will.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
May I make two suggestions... ?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
It was a different floor then...
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Fine.
Goodnight then.
Ilsa... you're alright?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
I'm not sure.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
I'm just like him.
Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
The Hinchberger wedding.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Why are you following me?
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Don't ask.
I checked it personally.
Follow me.
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
What about the house?
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
And what kind of sleeper?
There's a carriage house around back.
You could have.
You want company?
Maybe someday.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
That smell... oh, God.
It was very specific.
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
Welcome Home.
I don't know.
No --
How'd I know it was for you?
That?  That's Hill House.
This is where we're going?
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
It's okay... we're all here...
Nell, what do we do?
Oh!  You scared me.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
She was unhappy.
Why?
So far.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
No one will come any nearer than that.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
Fifteen dollars.
What do you do?
I know.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
No.  The world has missed you.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Red.  What else?
I think so.
Okay.
Just had to be sure.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Not for you, clearly.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
It's not a compliment.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
Why?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Who?
We all did.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Why not?
Because --
Come over here.
Not bad.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
I wouldn't talk.
Huh?
Been to the Boat Show.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
No reason.
Snuffed her.
Y'what?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Has he?
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
No one else is even here yet.
First in, first out, that's me.
One thing I need.
Not much -- you?
Same.
Uh-huh.
Didn't get it.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hard to miss.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
It's been a while.
What was that, then?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Ashamed.
Not ashamed.
Where you get your bank statements.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Are you serious.
I'll bloody well ask him.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Just now?  Overnight?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What about your grandmother?
Black market during the war.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Up the coast.
How far?
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
Bloke told me.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
So what's your beef, pal?
Of the deal, man.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
What am I doing?
You sure?
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Where else?
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Which kind?
The forever kind.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
The L.A.P.D.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
So what.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Something's on.
What?
Like what.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
What do you think?
Since when?
I don't want you here, Terry.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Go now.
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
I don't.
Be seein' you.
Tell me.
Tell you ...
Hello, Birdy.
That's what he keeps telling me.
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
It's OK...
No. Uh... family friend.
I can get it, yeah.
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah.
Cash?!
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
No, Dave, I wasn't.
How's business, Dave?
What is it, Dave?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
But it's...
Please, Ed.
Come on in.
I, uh... thanks.
Mm.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
Ahh...
I didn't say a word.
How are you?
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
You don't have to tell me anything.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
How did you get into the store?
No thanks.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Taking it seriously.
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
No thanks, honey.
Yeah, the best.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Huh?
Jesus...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Huh?
This hair.
Yeah.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Huh? No.
He's the dead guy.
What'd he say?
Birdy...
Hello, Walter.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Hello.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Ah.
Second chair.
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Under arrest for murder.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
It better be good.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Someone broke into this room.
What's the combination?
Let's go!
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Call me Vince.
Unfortunately, no.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
May I see that?
What is it?
Got my hands full here.
I know.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I'd say we're in its home.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
You must.
What are they?
They're eggs.
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Footsteps!
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
What is it?
Not that big.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
You're color blind.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Quiet.
Keep the animal quiet.
Frock's been fired.
What's that?
How did you know that?
I don't know.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Wounded?
The planetarium!
Vince!
It's scared of me.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
I have to shoot.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>Fiji.</i>
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
It's the busy season.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
No, hold back...
What's on the ClockCam?
He gave it back to his father.
It's just a matter of time.
Why would we--
Sweep the harbor.
What music?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
Thank you.
Of course.
Certainly a nomination.
I'm the creator.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Saturday?
I think I've studied enough.
Trust me.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I've got to show you something.
This is where it started.
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Did something happen today?
I've been thinking--
Oh, God.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
How do you know?
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
What's the hurry?
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Put some butter on it--or ice?
So why do you want to go?
I bet you did.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
You're part of this, aren't you?!
Oh, just so.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
You got it.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
You can count on it.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You're not FBI agents.
Yup.
A woman?  Work.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Agent Mulder.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Kurtzweil, we think.
Looking for him for what?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
Before the bomb went off?
That's what I'm saying.
Not according to the men in blue.
-- You saw this experiment?
What did it look like?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
You didn't know my father --
Where are you, Scully?
I'm on the roof.
No. I haven't.
What's wrong, Scully?
It's locked?
No you didn't.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
No.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
I don't know.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Mulder --
Very weird.
For the purpose of what?
Yeah...?
Run.
I don't know.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I think... something stung me.
Where are we?
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
Where's Scully?!
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I don't know.
I'm not taking any chances.
I've got to find Scully.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
Is she alive?
Yes.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
My life is over.  Go.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Shush.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
He needs to be turned over.
She said convincingly.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
How hard could it be...?
You don't know the procedure.
I know him.
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
Yes.  I am.
I can't leave him!
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Good for them.
I got it.
No.  Thank you.
He's beautiful...
's broken.
Mocky-Lock.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Initiating connection.
What's wrong?
I'll get her...
Yes.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
No.
You're looking well.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Completely unaware.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Now?
Now.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Ja, ja, ja.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, yes, yes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Yes.
Whiskey.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
Just another part I've got to learn.
In German?
Well you read this.
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Tell you what?
Where is she?
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I'm so sorry.
It's all right.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
A parrot...Let it go.
Have you seen Calloway?
I'm sorry.
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
I saw him today.
His.
Oh, well.
Why are you lying?
Thank you.
Keep the packet.
Yes.
That's the reason.
I have never seen him.
No.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
They'll be returned, miss.
They are - private - letters.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
How will I know you?
Thank you.
Fellow called Lime.
Been here long?
No.
Once in a while.
No, sorry.
Best thing that ever happened...
Pin it on a...
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Getting around, Martins.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
In Vienna...
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
I'm not asking you to.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
You all did.
Win what?
Two thirty.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Well, there's not much time.
One can't just leave - please.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
No, I don't know...
Heard of Harry Lime?
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
It's good to see you, Holly.
She's been arrested.
And - Anna...
You can get somebody else...
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Zwei zwartze.
At the end of every chapter --
What did he say?
But he said he died instantaneously.
What's the name of this girl?
How do you do.
Vinkel.
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
English?
Who?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Must be some mistake.
Yes, sir.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What does he say?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Who else?
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Yes.
Something wrong.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Oh.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
His name?
Okay.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Richard. Hi.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
There is one problem.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
We're ok.
A fin!
Yes.
A bit fucking late.
What happened?
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
Two.
Richard?
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
Swim?
Where did you lose it?
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
He's an asshole.
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
Who the fuck are you?
Then I won't bring you....
I don't, but...
Why the fuck not?
Just don't.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
I just read it....
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Killing himself.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
You want a punch in the mouth?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
No. What are you looking for?
You don't own this place.
I didn't realize you cared.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Nothing. Let's go....
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Those aren't Jews.
Of course they're Jews.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
The arguments, anyway.
I thought you hated Torah.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
You do it on the inside....
Don't tell me what I --
Yes!
Balint?
It's German.
What is happening?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
That's meat.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Isn't it true?
A Jewish prayer.
Number ten.
Get out of here....
Here...
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Mrs. Moebius.
Why? Why would she?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
How?
What are you trying to say?
What do you think you should have done?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
No.
Obviously.
Funny?
He was funny.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Just a little... What's the difference?
So what?
They're not that Jewish.
And let us say...
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Does he know?
No.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
The documents are forged.
Italian is practically the same thing.
Enzo Molinari.
In a lake.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Enzo!
Checking out the competition.
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't, I swear.
Don't.
Why?
Lira?
Dollars.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
It isn't lit yet.
... What's your name again?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
... You married?
Forget it.  I was joking.
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
What?
Your mother?
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
What is it?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No!  I would never cheat you.
Well that's very nice of you.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
No... in the hut.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
It's too loud for me.
Lucky I was there to save you.
I'd better get back now.
I don't know, I just feel it.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
I'm still here.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
It's me again.
... Not at all.
You sure?
Absolutely positive.
I didn't dive.
... Nothing.
I saw how it has to be.
... Are you sure?
Positive, Sir.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Johana... New York.
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
They're going to send detectives.
What?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
No.  I'm just depressed.
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
In the spring when he melts!
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
... Yes?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Yeah, no kidding.
Sure. Why not.
Yes Esther.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Take a look.
No, it was the perfect level.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Nice fellow?
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I sleep it off.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
What do you want to see him for?
I want him to lock me up.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
Where? Where did you find it?
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Let me see it ——
Tomorrow -—
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
What, senorita?
I'll miss you too, honey --
I want to ask you something.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
We're old friends.
More or less.
Yes.
It was you.
Not! I tell you. No!
That was a calamity!
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Why?
And not a sign of the leopard?
That doesn't make sense.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know -- Teresa -—
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
That might depend on where you’re going.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
That depends what you’re looking at.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
When did you get back?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Sorry?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Good.
...We’re turning in circles.
Something like that?
Something like that.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants.
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Yeah.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Do you know a friendly cop?
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Have we done business before?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
What...?
You... Fuck you!
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
No... No...  I swear...
Where?
What?
Where are we?
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
Where is it?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
My rates...
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Don’t jump any red lights.
Shut up and drive!
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Should I come back in five minutes?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
What about which girlfriend?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Viens.
Alors quoi?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Three...
So why didn’t he?
What do you think, huh?
I can only tell you what he told us...
Costliest!
What do you think?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Come with me...
Jeanne, no...
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You make it sound so simple...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
It would not be the same without you.
Do as I say!
I want to stay with you...
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
Good.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Quite a few.
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Where... where am I?
And God who allowed you to be caught?
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
I'll be right here... I promise.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
You have nothing to regret...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Thanks be to God.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
Does he have hair?
That's not a lot.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Good.  Where are the English?
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
He's on the other side of the river.
For what?
Sooner is better than later!
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We need another ten minutes...
The bridge won't wait!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Perfectly.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Never look behind -- only ahead!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Because... because you just can't!
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Who gave you that horse?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
I might ask you the same question.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Who?
Yes... lots of things!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
My father's.
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Only God knows the answer to that.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Yes.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Dorota.
He'll be back before curfew.
Dead.
What are you doing?
What, I'm working, what?
What?
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Can you help?
I've no money.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
That makes a change.
They were taking you away.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Can you help? I've no money...
Wladek! How are you?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
It's a little cut, nothing.
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
I'm not going anywhere.
No, I don't think so?
In the attic.
Show me.
We're getting out.
Not yet.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Watch your feet!
Watch his hand
No, it was a table.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Yes
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
You don't want to learn.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
You mean in signs?
They are washed.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
It's my mother's piano.
A piano?
Hello.
She never gives him a turn.
Do I know any gigs?
Play a song then
That's right.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
He'll probably fall down.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
You got a bag or somethin?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
All of it.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
That's the way I want it.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
Who's got the contract?
Good lad.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
You never do, kid.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
You know anything about him?
If we ever get to it.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldn't?
He'll show.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Yeh.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
That's why he won't know it.
See and raise five.
Five and call.
Pass.
Raise 500.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You doin' anything tonight?
Yeh, sleepin'.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
He'd like to kill me.
Yeh, this time anyway.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
What do you mean?
Then why the rat?
Maybe a couple million.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
I think he will.
Come on, gimme a break.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
I'm sorry.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Nothing.
Another young man.
It's the same one.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Why not?
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
What do you mean?
Hello, there!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
tried him once -
There. 
Why... in the heart.
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
That's the truth.
You see how much we have to say.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
If you think it'll be all right.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Was there much blood?
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
We were looking for this bird.
What's he want of you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
No.
Who's is it?
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
I'll take care of him.
No.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
--was Wynant's.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
About three.
Did you go?
Goodbye.
I guess all the suspects are here.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
I didn't mean you, Mister.
You've said that for weeks.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Never mind.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
What did you do with the rest?
That's all right.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
But suppose some business comes up...
That's just why I'm going.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
You're always teasing.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
This is your party.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
That last Martini.
Santa Claus.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
I'd like to see you work.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
There's one coming.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
Who's that?
Macaulay.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
He's just been for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What are you going to do?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You bet I wouldn't.
Goodbye, darling.
What do you mean?
He was down in the shop.
Wynant's body?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Sure.
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I've got a lulu -- why?
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me.
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
Yes.  Nick!
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Maybe she has.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
You did.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
Break it out.
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Let me see the map.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Move!
I heard!
What about it?
You don't know he isn't.
It's a combat action.
No.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Suppose I don't go for that?
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Knock it off!
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Oh, that's fun.
Wh-what do you think--
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I got that...sir.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
Mine.
Mine.  Land mine!
I heard it click.
Just be cool.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Why you got to move away to talk!?
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Shut up and listen!
What are they doing here?
Just stay down.
They're going to kill us!
They can't shoot us in here.
So where do we start?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
What?
Wes is dead!
What if he's not?
They'll search the pack.
And you; you've got it all together.
Makes two of us.
Damn.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Yeah, I guess we should.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
We go this way.
Yeah.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
What?
He's going to slow down.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
Naw, nothing.
That's in two days.
Like I said; so?
What!?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, God!
Yeah, well, we're not.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Yeah, we're down.
What do you see?
I think we found something.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Correct.  Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Correct.
What happened?
Too low.
No, Tetanty.
Now.
Now?
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Don't go.
Don't be so sure.
I'll try.
I don't know.
AH UGH.
It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
What?
Why are you so concerned?
What's going on?
What?
When?.....How?
Right now.
Look!
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
That way.
Look more closely.
What?
Too late....stay close.
What kind of answer is that?
No?
No......  She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
All right...
Where's LUH?
Look more closely.
I'm only trying to help you.
Save yourself....
I thought of something.....
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
No thanks, Bev.
Go ahead.
Just do it.
Hang on.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
I don't know. You tell me?
Look, it's a longshot...
`Til we get a better lead.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Be right back.
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Off the scale.
What do we do?
Don't touch that.
I don't know.
What... ?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No excuses, just do it!
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
Hey, I'm next.
A bowling alley.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
He's my brother...
People are dying.
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Stay in the truck.
What? Nobody, I-
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Look, it's important.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Fuck factor ten.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Don't talk.
Ain't that a shit--
It's about this.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Huh?
IRA - instant retirement account.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
That feeling won't last long.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Diamonds all over.
Well, have you found it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
<u>Niente!</u>
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I thought so.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
No, not at all!
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
But not now.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
What is it?
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
Good day, Major.
No, Captain, I tell you--
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
No, thank you.
Gaston Monescu.
Gaston!
Last year? It can't be that long.
The fourteenth of May.
Two fifty-three, five--
Seven and nine!
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Naturally I did.
Oh!
Too much blue in crimson.
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
No. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Beautiful specimen.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
You're hired!
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Then riding together.
Um-hum ...
Hair?
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
Good night.
Like that?
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
No--thirty-five! 
Instantly.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Goodbye.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Please!  Thank you.
May I?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
Well, where is it?
An hour, two at most.
You're certain?
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
So do I.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
What do I tell your mother?
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Good. Settled then.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
Almost as good as you.
Well I can.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
Jack.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Au contraire, mon cher.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Could it have damaged the ship?
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Never let go.
You had it the entire time?!
It would be a nice change from you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
We'll save you a place at our table.
I think you do.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving--
Want to take it back?
Nice lines--
Yes--
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
How about giving me another coat?
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
Brett is the name.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Very--your mother?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
Sooner it you like.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Sorry.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Don't let's talk about it.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Good night, idiot!
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
What's the matter?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
A dollar forty.
My change.
Change?
I'll take one. 
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
On the drunk.
Get it!
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
I'll go with you.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
What'll I say?
In New York.
Cut it out.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
So what?
Miss Marsh.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Just what the doctor ordered.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Very--
You don't shoot squirrels.
Well, let's hear the poem--
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
I sincerely hope so--
Thank you.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
What!--are you crazy?
I'll explain later--
Ain't got time.
Hey--you! Where you going?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
Isn't that a daisy?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Good.  That's real good.
Excuse me?
You retired, too?
Yeah, you look it.

What?
No.
I made a promise.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
How is he?
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.

You'd die for fun?
How would you know?

Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
I didn't mean it that way.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No really, I can stay a while.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
You wanted to talk?
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
Not anymore, not after this.
Drop his horse.
We'll see about that.
So he can tell the story.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Fine.  Better.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well I'm real scared.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
So to speak.
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
They're carrying guns in town.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Wyatt...
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
- We all want what we can't have?
- Four wheel drive?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Is this another one of your games?
Just hold me.
Well... If you insist.
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
Let's take a look at the body.
Step into my office.
She married a hockey player.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
That's reassuring.
Interesting video tape.
They point, I shoot.
Depends what number you write.
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
No.
You too.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
- You're not.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Blood or Dutch?
You are seriously deranged.
My father left me the business.
What do you mean?
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
Don't say it.
We blast through.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
It doesn't quite add up.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
Captain Morton.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
Start the grinders.
You have to leave -
You come with me -  You stay here.
Fueled and waiting.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
Kill him! Finish it!
Who is it?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
I don't know. He's not in the database -
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Maybe. Maybe not.
Abort the cruise.
Will the cruise set it off?
We got the same thing.
Oh here we go with that.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
My name is Sam. Samuel.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was nip and tuck.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Now how far would further out be?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Go back to sleep.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
It would be nice.
You must have been really sick.
How is the garden doing?
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Tolerable well.
Let me get you a cup?
Only if you can spare it.
Good afternoon to you.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
You can bring ONE toy...
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Bye, house.
What?  What is it?
Woody!  Buzz!
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
I'd better take a look anyway.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
You mean that happy child?
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Go away.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
What?!
The match!
Hold still, Buzz!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
I got dibs on his hat!
Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Look!  Janie!
She's sick!
No she's NOT --
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Will you quit moving around?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
A lunchbox...?!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
You murdering dog!
No, no, no, wait!
I was close to being scared that time.
Okay, save your batteries!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Speed up!
There's no mirror.
There's not.
Excuse me.
I carried you up to your bed.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Home is where the heart is.
She'll have to learn.
What about school?
Get away from me...
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Living with him put years on me.
Let me in.
Ah, come on now!
I'm cold.
You did what?
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Surely she is older?
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
So did I.
Everything is gone, now.
Nothing is left but us.
You're late for breakfast.
Nine thousand dollars.
You will believe me, because it's true.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
So my wife is lying?
Goodbye Arnie.
It's so frustrating.
Me, too.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
So's the video camera.
At least she's alive.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
What do you think?
Hi.
What's up?
Just watching you.
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Like I give a fuck.
Oh, yes I can.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Do you work?
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
You do?  What else you do?
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
Not like.  It is.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Who do you work for?
So does half of San Diego.
You want to make a wager on this?
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
I don't know.
Depends who it's from.
We're playing!
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
We aren't barbarians.
Yes, sir!
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Your new friends.
What?
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Javier Rodriguez.
It was an anonymous tip.
What is it you want me to do?
Only if he can be trusted.
He'll do what I say.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I got money.
Just tell me where she is.
She hasn't called you?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Agents who died in the field.
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You were in my way.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Can you not go yourself.
I guess you would, Franco.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
What's your name?
Diane.
I'm going home.
It's where I live.
think I left something back at the -
Ssshh!
Sorry.
Shut up.
Out.
Come on.
Because it's illegal.
Holding hands?
Easy for you to say.
Are you clean?
Yes.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
Too young for what?
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Happy birthday.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
It's an interesting theory.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
It's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Aye.
That's nice.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Cheers.

Running time?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
OK, so who was it, then?
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
It wasn't that bad.
Did he -- you know?
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
God, you're sick.
Four Grand.
That's tough.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
Why, thank you.
Yeah.
Sure will, pal, sure will.
Are you serious?
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
A walk.
But where?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
You doubt me?
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Plotting our new course.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Position, Bird of Prey?
But the shuttle-
A Federation starship.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
The power was within you.
What is it you seek?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
If we could send a distress signal...
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
MM.?
Are we leaving, Captain?
Yes, Spock?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
But he does seem familiar?
Who is it he reminds you of?
To land any closer would risk detection.
Yes, Captain?
Let me do something.
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You ordered me to kill my brother.
I have a half brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
Is what possible?
That's a little vague, Spock -
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
It must be all those marsh melons.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I'll take you to the bridge.
Now learn something about yourself.
No. I refuse.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Am I? We'll see.
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
No conditions.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...





  



Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
No. You must kill me.
You know I'm right.
I hide no pain.
I know you better than that.
I belong here.
I don't understand...
You haven't told him?
Hi, Flynn.
Uh... got any cinnamon?
Of what?
Hello, Alan.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
Right on the money!
Yes, okay, exactement!
End of line.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
It's too far!
Let's get some power here.
How 'bout yourself?
Recognizers!
Alan-One...
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
End of line.
Do it!
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
We have to get off this beam!
Where's Flynn?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
I have a book report.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
In the helicopter.
What?
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Put a tap on her phone.
Yeah, but for who?							*
What are you talking about?
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
The purse is still at the house.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Sorry.
Yes what?
Not exactly.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Me too.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What did you tell him?
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Yes.
Why?
Louder please.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
You wouldn't believe me.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
It makes you tell the truth?
What about Juno?
No.  But I wanted to.
God, you have great legs.
Harry... snap out of it!
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Go ahead.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Fuck you.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Yes.  Now go.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Find out who this Renquist it.
What letter?
Nope.
He wants to speak with you.
This is great, we got cable.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Now hang up.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Thanks a lot.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
'Bout twelve.
Would you like to get some pie?
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
Where are you from.
What kinda music do you like?
That's a long time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
Is he black?
You will?
Thank you.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
I just gotta get somethin'.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Why Cancoon?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Take that shit somewhere else.
Live with what?
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm her husband.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Get the fuck outta here!
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
It'll get ya high.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Elliot what?
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.
Yeah?
In case of what?
Yeah, OK.
The police department?
They'll be along.
I guess so. Follow me.
Yeah?
No.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
We grew up together.
That's about all I ever eat.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I got some money I can give you -
I give up. Who are you?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Could we try it now?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
I believe he believes him.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Or a bit player -
Or a supporting actor -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
He saw the wire.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
Rock whores.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Just put it in your purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Put it in your pants.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Exactly room-mates.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, what?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
I need to go.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
A jail?  Prison?
Underground.
Hiding?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
I have to go.
July?!
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
What?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Who's keeping an eye on you?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Lock it now!
Jeffrey Mason?
The gun! ... I lost it
Just like that?  You were in prison?
...I had a dream about...something like that.
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
You know -- your plan.
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Who am I supposed to shoot?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Might be tight.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
I don't care, just get me there.
Thirty even.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
So?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Yeah, you better remember that.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Open up!
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
We ain't got no Beck's.
Yes.  Yes it is.
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
There's someone in the house.
What does it look like?
When did you buy a gun?
I'm just going to my car.
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe I don't want you to.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
I got it.
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
Such as?
No.
Did you ever?
I don't know how.
You just walk away.
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
I can't.
Jake.
How much money has he got?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
There is no us, remember?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
There has to be!
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
What about him?
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
You killed him!
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
I think I busted my leg.
Can you climb back up.
Where the hell am I going to go?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
The trunk.  It's locked.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
I'm her husband.
Husband . . .?
Grace, tell him.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
John Stewart.
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
Hungry?
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
The time wasn't right.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
There's another reason?  It better be good.
That's a thick change of heart.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I said come on!
How about I pick one out for you?
I've had time to get over it.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this.
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Not as bad as it looks.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something, old man?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
Grace, tell him.
It ain't broke.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
Live there?
Would I what?
Would you kill her?
I was hoping we could talk.
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
About what you said this morning.
You're talking like a madman.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
It's the truth, Jake.
I've had time to get over it.
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
So?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Hundred-fifty.
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
What?
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Open up!
You got the money?
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No! No police.
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
I like that about me, beautiful.
I got it.
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Lift me down.
Beautiful?
And what would that be?
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
No.
Did you ever?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
Walk away.
Try me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
There is no us, remember?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I'm not coming back.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
My mother died in this canyon.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
I busted my leg!
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Get in.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Where to?
Out of here.
But, in particular?
What kind?
Beck's.
You didn't hear something?
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
I said come on!
Is Noel in?
No.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
He's asleep.
Oh.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
out again?
Rust?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
We're supposed to be honest.
Think carefully?
What about the game?
It's finished. I won.
In college. A car accident.
Is there a problem?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
But not a knife?
One last question.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Yes he is.
Just one--
I'll help you.
There's nothing to do.
Two hundred and seventy.
There's no more left?
I'm not scared.
That's great.
Do you know why?
Know what?
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy listen to what--
Is David Dunne there?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Where is it?
But what they done, they...
You told them cowboys you had it.
Thank God.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
'Course he's coming.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Three days? I must be.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Yeah. See?
She back in Kansas?
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Oh yeah.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
All week?
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
I could run off them whores.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
You don't recollect!
He got the boy's horse.
You missed him? You didn't...?
I got him.
Yeah.
After a ways.
You still think he's in there?
Yeah, he's in there.
Yup.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Yeah.
First one what?
We all got it comin', Kid.
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You better get on back, Miss.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You ain't shot.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Two weeks, I guess.
This Kid, what's he like?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I didn't see nothin' planted.
HEY, KID.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Did I what?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
What?
Who said that?
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
You gonna share your half with him?
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
We'll bury him.
That ain't what I mean.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Hell, yeah.
There's more.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
I love you.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
What do you care what he says?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
I'11 be alright.
Maybe more.
No killing?
Who's Keyser Soze?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
This I had to see myself.
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
Where?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams...
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
Yes.  It would be.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
It looks that way.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Say it.
I was her doctor.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
No.
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Objection.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You may step down.
You would not...?
No.
Just now...
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
We just ...
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
And you wrote that...
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Why?
) I'm sorry ...?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
... that's perfectly all right.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
Nothing happened.
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Why is that?
I was held up.
That's perfectly all right.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
Mr. Concannon...?
Exception!
Mr. Alito, please.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
How come you're calling me from...?
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Still looking.
What Hotel are you staying at?
And what are you?  A cop?
Yes.  It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Do you want me to go...?
No, no, I'm just...
I've got to work.
Isn't there something you...
That's what I am.
Yes.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Where is he?
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
You got a good memory, Franky.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
The Hospital...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked?
... You saw her?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
What?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes...
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
Yes.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
You don't have to do it for a living.
And you like it.
No, I'm all right.
Someone dead.
It's not my line.
Yes.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
You.
Why?
Judy Barton.
Who you are --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
But you haven't lived here long.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Just dinner.
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow morning.
No? Then what?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Ernie's?
Well, after all, it's "our place."
That's what I had in mind.
Too late. I've got my face on.
All in good time.
Can't you see?
Oh, yeah. There.
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
No! Let me go!
We'll find him.
I loved you, Madeleine.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
No...
At...
This afternoon.
Oh... wandering about.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You like it, too.
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
I enjoyed talking to you.
No! No, thank you!
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
Shopping?
No.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
No birds live here.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
When?
Long ago...
Where?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
Where?
I know.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
And it's a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Let me go.
Where?
What car?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What do you mean?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Oh!
That's following a train of thought.
Normal.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
My... the acrophobia.
Okay.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel.
Who?
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Out. I've got things to do.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Bye-bye!
Where?
Oh?
Did you need it?
Oh?
What I've been doing?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
How?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
I thought so!
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Excellent.
I need a drink.
What?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Well that's what I said.
Name one.
Why was the floor wet?
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
Don't point at me.
The hell you do.
The hell I don't.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
You don't know what you're doing.
What?
What are you talking about?
What do you think you are doing?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
So I didn't fucking do it!
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
We've already done this.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
Alright. Let's do it.
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
Who? What are you talking about?
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're singing.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No. I think it's fucked.
I won't do it.
Don't eyeball your kids.
If anything ever happens to me...
What happened? Oh my God...
Where's the bathroom?
There's more.
So where's that leave us?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
Where is she?
The groom?
That's right.
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Fish?
Not tonight.
Here's his head.
I'm not talking to you?
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
Well, I didn't mean it.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Good God...Good God...
Go ahead.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What did you ask me?
I said, what have we done?
What?
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Take care of business.
What does that mean?
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
It's my fucking opinion.
The hell you didn't!
The hell I did!
Moore?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
False.
True.
Not true.
Then what do they have?
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
What?
We're not goosed.
Goosed!
Goosed!
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
Yes.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
Why what?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
What else have you forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
What?
Are we going to do this again?
How do you figure?
Right before the wedding?
He's a moron.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's quiet.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
He's a great chef.
It's vile!
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Kiss me...?
I'm not. What's the problem?
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Go down where?
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
I'll call them from the road.
Of course.
Hi.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
Where are you?
What okay?
What!
The chairs.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
Well, can you come back inside?
Now?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I know.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Okay. Okay.
Do you love me?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
Call the police.
It's too late.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
What does that mean?
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Move the bodies?
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
About what?
You're not breathing right?
He's your brother.
So?
Go for it.
Come on.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
What?
I have no idea.
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
Where?
"You Send Me."
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
Okay boys, smile!
Drum banging real times.
It was an accident!
That's right.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, the children sleep with me.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
That one.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
Who is she?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Don't you ever see him?
Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
What are you going to do?
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
She's left.
Is she coming back?
Why?
Canelo!
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Come with me.
I'm afraid.
A black bull came.
A black bull!
Yes -- very, very big!
You little liar! Get out of here!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
This louse is looking for trouble.
Good, then let's go!
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I have a headache.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Hello.
From the terrace.
Why would they be going there?
If you can catch him.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Fine —— you want to stay here?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Where's my gun?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Not from in here.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Do I get to see it or not?
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
It feels so.. .real.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
All my work is my finest.
Of course you are.
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What you need is a collar.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
This is my area of expertise.
You know I am.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Both.
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Part of him is.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
Thanks.
That's why I'm asking.
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Lindenmeyer?
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you.
Then shoot him already.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
What are you saying...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
No, this is great.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
...can we have a white one...?
Can we have a white one, please...
What'd ya think?
Indeed it is.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
...where?
Come on.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
...the Harvester... 
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
Who's got the story? 
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
Tell me again.
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Why?
Precisely.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...what's the Long View?
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
<u>Nashville</u>...?
...Stanley Moss...
...brazen-it-through...
The War is Over.
Gloria -- sell the House.  
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Never quit a winner.
Could we have you in here, please...7
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Out in Oklahoma.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Heavy weather East of here.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
...uh ... No, that's...
Why not?
The... 
"The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
President's speech.
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Of what?
The Albanian Campaign.
We <u>were</u> the Albanian campaign, John -- <u>We Were There</u>.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Uh huh...why?
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Show Must Go On.
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
Leopard Skin...
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
No, he's back in Nashville.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
No problem.  Here's the...
You like it?
Yes.
Fine.  Good.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
A beret.
Why a beret?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
Why...?
Is today Laundry Day...?
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Sell?
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
The FAA announcement.
Alright. Why so pissed?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
You speak for me, son.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Allright. Wait here...
Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Only if I want something bad enough.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
...how do you know? You wish...
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
He still likes you
Businessman!
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Good evening sir.
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
Can I give her a message?
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Vell.  Goodnight.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Go away.
Right behind you.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Six six and six
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
I know that.
Of course you will.
No, he wouldn't.
I started seeing things.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
You think that'll help?
Well, that's what we're here for.
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
No.
The wives.
Um...
She isn't here.
Oh-kay...
I have to go.
I didn't kill my wife.
Um...yes.
I'm not...
I can't, no, no, I can't...
I've never even met you.
You do?
Right.  I'm sorry.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
What?
No.  No, I don't.
Yeah.
No, I don't.
Please leave me alone.
Claire.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I don't know.
I should be going anyway.
This is...
We know each other.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
I came in from my room...
We were suite mates.
You are?
Well good.  So you're human.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Jody--
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
What?
This.
Shhh.
M-E...
Jody, wait.
I think so
Jody, she's alive.
What?
Please.
I was down in Adamant...
If she was dangerous before--
Jody he was lying.
Three weeks.
Yep.
Three o'clock.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
Fine.
I am, really.
You know what I mean.
I know.
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Yup.
Shhh.
I'll be there.
Of him I think.
Did she say that?
Hurry...
Did you call the police?
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You are so brilliant.
You know what that does to me.
Oh, no...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
What?  No.  No.
You didn't?
What's going on, Claire?
What?
A flare?
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
...like it never even happened...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
Well, that's a relief.
Harvey says he's amazing.
We had a seance.
Who did?
I will NOT.
Then where is she?
Really big bed.
Call ya later.
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
STOP IT!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Since when?
Your wife...
STOP IT!
What?
To Caitlin!!
You should have tried harder.
How can you be sure?
What?
Nothing.
You don't have to do that.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
Mauduh...
MADISON!
:Well, they are.
But you've not told Michael.
Two what...?
Two heartbeats.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Michael, Rowan should -
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Who is this...?
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
When did she die...?
Who is this...?
I under5tand.  All the same
Who the hel1 -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
There are things I have to know!
The lamplight.  That's all.
You're a monster.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
He just went out like & light-
Like this...?
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
Do not tell me that!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Leave me alone!
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
I do not understand...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
Harder...
My jury's still out on that,
Rowan...
HARDER!
He fools around with his patients too.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
A little wine...?
Dropped it.
Did you see the old man on the ---
Talking to me dear...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
A bit much.    Lucas.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
What were you talking about...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You can't just -
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
You really love this guy...?
He's got great hands.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Is that what you were doing...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Yes - I have had it for years.
I really don't know what to say
The touch?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
I'm a dentist
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
No she didn't...
I have something I have to show you...
Why should I?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Nothing could be better...
Open it...
Out - I may be some time
Yes - I suppose so...
He doesn't need to...
What was I supposed to do?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
What's this all about?
No - a dentist
Yes...?
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Yes - one please.
Not ever. Never.
I better go, Dad.
Take a whiff of heaven.
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
We reinvented ourselves.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Well. The prom's coming up.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Yeah? You like?
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
I mean, what do you think?
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Of course we are.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
I will not have my boys arguing.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
The one with the horses.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
And who IS Ted Nelson?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Very funny.
Just a formality.
I meant biologically.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
In what sense?
You never know around here.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
I see.
I doubt it.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
I know.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
He's on the move?
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Come on.
But absolutely true.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I'll make you very proud.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
I have only one concern...
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
You're sure?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I was like a different person tonight.
You were the new and improved you.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
I'm just a messenger.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
Kelly Van Ryan...
I... You know... I...
Thanks.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Back to the land of grownups.
I net a guy in a bar.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Just check out the car.
Where's the body?
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Why is that?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I'm not on your property!
Hi, Mon.
Sam!  Hi!
I miss Dad.
Yes.  God, Mom...
In back of the garage.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
Hello.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
I did.  At Blue Balls.
Will they?
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
The one you bought at school.
That's right.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Didn't you see her this morning?
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Jim West.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
Aha?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Yes.  Now, observe....
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
Hey, I tried the board.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
It's better than nothing.
It is?
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
It's a town!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
My pleasure.
I know!  I know!
Where have you been?
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
But it only has six legs.
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
We'll see.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Oh, I would hope not.
I've had some practice.
Private train?
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Yes sir.
This is Colonel Richards.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
I deal with some tough customers.
The first.
Yes!
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
It's a smelting retort.
It is?
They're coming.
When are they coming?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Just get me some horses.
Let's go.
Yes...?
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Why not?
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I love you.
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
I will!  But I need help!
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Good.  How long will it take?
Are you okay?
Farmer.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Are you a warrior?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
You hear trouble.
What is it?
I hate this.
Fresh goat's milk.
Absolutely!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
I won't.
Well what did she say?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Ahhh!
No!
Kill him!
That's all I ever wanted!
Then I will teach you.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Shhhhh!
Now use it.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
There's nobody here.
Just do it!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Courage, Willow.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Yes, sir.
Pick up the hat.
Who'd you see?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Yeah.
You know who?
Maybe.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
I would not be too sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
But why?
Only the elders.
How long?
What?
You tell him. When you're able.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Hochmut?
I know what he said.
Oh. The bullets.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Not long... A few days.
I was being foolish?
Aren't you? After today?
Here. Whenever you want them.
I didn't even know about it.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Make that 1790.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
Not yet.
But... if you had to guess?
John said you're Amish.
Oh.
You didn't have to...
His name is John Book.
Looks dead...
You are acting like one!
I will be the judge of that.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I don't think she knows.
All right, where is he?
My son is out there!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
No... No. It is just the English way.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh -- all right.
If she...
If she?
Is morally, ethic'ly
Who are you?
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Goodbye, folks!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Catch him, you fool!
Toto, too.
Oh, now?
Whenever you wish.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh -- yes.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
What's she doing now?
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Did you say something?
Oil can....
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Look -- it ticks!
The nerve.
Yes.
But why?  Why?
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
Huh?  What'd he say?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Ohhhh --
Ohh!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
To Oz!
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Here -- here --
The other side....
Yes --- there.
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Ah --
Dorothy next!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
I don't know.
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here --   Come on.
What was that?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
And you're going to lead us.
Yes, you.
Now...
This way!  Come on!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Whozat?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't neither --
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
No, her dog!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
Ohhhhhh!
No, sir!
We do.
To Oz?
To Oz!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Hurry -- hurry --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Dorothy!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
You know something?
It's a whozis?
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh, dear, dear.
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh --
Come on, fellows!
Oh, no!
Go on!
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Elektra King.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Elektra would control it all.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
I’m sorry.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
You’re not going to.
It’s the only way out...
I know.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
No. You’ll be safe here.
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
Soon she’ll be everywhere.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Oh James.
You, of course. I need some information.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
I thought you were the one in her business.
A rope!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
No!  Get me out!
Istanbul.
How appropriate.
Bond!
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Is it?
How would you know?
What do you think?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Where it can do the most damage.
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I would like to use the bathroom --
Please.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
We don't know that.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Cured, yes.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
What if you¹re wrong??
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
His . . . whatever.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
What are you up to?
Don't look.  Turn around.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Those cars.  What year is this??
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
I'm sorry about Blake.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
Looks like a diner.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Let me.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
That one I'm real familiar with.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
We all do.
What are you talking about?
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Uh-huh.
I wanted to talk to you.
Sure you are, sport.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
What do you say?
Suit yourself.
He takes himself seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
Senator?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
To find Rogue.
How?
If she held on any longer she could have.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
Enough for a test.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir?
What?
Baack!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Well... yes.
You have your tickets?
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
I promise.
Very....very!
Whatever makes you happy.
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling!
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Why does he call you 'master'?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Is it worth taking a chance?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
May I have it, please?
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
A week.  Ten days at most.
I didn't do that.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
And do you also say Fro dereck?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You must be Igor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, just the two.
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
I thought you wanted to.
Wockers with the knockers???
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
Fro-derick!
Did you hear that strange music?
Must be the music room.
Could be worse!
How?
Could be raining!
I want that brain.
That's not bad.
Thank you, Master.
This guy means business.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
You can say that again.
No, no!  That whole thing!
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
What did you find out?
Can you play it?
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
It's alive!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
How nice.
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Yes!
I know.
Raise the platform, hurry!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
I think I'll...carry him.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Give him the sedative!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
I think so.
Good night!
Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
But, after all, you have yours.
And I have mine.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Do Something!  Stall them!
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Yes.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
