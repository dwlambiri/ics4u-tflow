Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
There.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Have fun tonight?
What good stuff?
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Who?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
He was, like, a total babe
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
Let go!
You set me up.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Thirty-two.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
What makes you think he'll do it?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Hey.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
He always look so
What's this?
William would never have gone to a state school.
That's never been proven
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
I say, do what you wanna do.
Okay?
I just need to lie down for awhile
Why 're you doing this?
Dorsey.
I thought you were above all that
Maybe.
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Who?
What are you doing here?
You 're so --
Wholesome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
A soft side? Who knew?
Something like that
State trooper?
Fallacy.
The duck?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
Is that a request or a command?
No.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
My grandmother's .
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
Parts of it.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Say it
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
You were right. She's still pissed.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
Tumescent!
Have a great time, honey!
Your daughters went to the prom.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Your life, and that of others!
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
May I ask by whom?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
Appointment to what?
I want to go with you!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
I'm not bargaining!
You defend yourself admirably...
What do you see?
You come!  You speak first!
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Esdras is a Jew.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You tell that to them!
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
You bring the cigarettes?
...delusions and paranoia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What's your cut?  How much?
No.  No way.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
So you were never a prostitute?
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Who did cause and origin?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Yeah, right.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Takin' a bath.
Sorry...PD only.
Are you hit?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
You know what that is, right?
Watch the news?
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Pretty.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You goin' to the escort service?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
You thirsty?
Why not?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
So...who's Nicky?
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
That's good.
Yeah.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
You promise?
Thank you.
So what's unique?
Okay.  You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
Are you married?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
Don't fool around.
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Shut up.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
I'm serious.
You got that?
Emil???!
We spent it!
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
What are you doing here?
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
I used an accelerant.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Mouth's clean, too.
How long they been livin' here?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Really.
That seems very unlikely.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
And don't you worry about it.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
That's right.
Fortunately, they did.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Name?
This is three years old.
Yeah.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I want to drive awhile.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
I hear you've got visitors.
You here to write my life story?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Luther was part of the gang?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Must be billy's girl.
How much?
Half a million.
We split 50-50?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
You stay with me...
What about Luther?
Notice something funny about that bus?
It's late, they're closing...
Do I get to kiss her too?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
What am I wanted for?
Hey, you're right.
I'm all wet.
Hey, you know what I really think?
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
You sure you want me to?
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
No wonder you're so popular.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Hello.
Hi, it's me...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Three more hours...
Hard man to live with.
Hey...
How ya doin'?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Let her go.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
Five bills.
Five.  On credit.
Give it back.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Corn-i-Lius?
What're you laughing about?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...would you like a drink?
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Who are you?
He's a she!
So you do know her.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
Good luck..
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
It's a miracle!!!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh... at least fifty.
So, just how big was this fare?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
6... 5...
You know how to fly this thing?
What did you say? What did you do?
What mission?
And the third one?
Don't you open your messages?
I'm not going.
...Shit!
It's my wife.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
Apipoussan!
Uh...
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
...Like love...
Tell me...
The cash man!
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This thing solid?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
Options.
Wait or act.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I love you.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Who are you calling?
Mrs. Christian.
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Bullshit.
Dino...
What the fuck... !
That's five thousand dollars.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Where are the women?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
You're a dead man.
Call me Tom.
Celebrity Films.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
How much did he pay you?
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it.
Easy enough for you.
Of what sort?
They're no friends of mine.
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Big date tonight?
I'm not a cop.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
How old are you?
Where are your parents?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
I told you I can't, not yet.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Hello... ?
You told me to look, so I looked.
What was she running from?
Why do you think he did it?
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
Okay, I'll take it all.
No, you may not.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
You alright?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
It was Freddy.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
I don't get it.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
What's wrong with me?
Something wrong with the stairs?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Who says I don't like you?
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Where are we going?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
But Dad --
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
You think that's the place she's buried?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
Then get out!
They think I'm nuts.
Poor woman...
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Vomit?
It's okay.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
But if they <u>do</u>?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Yeah?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Is there any way out of it?
What about down?
Excuse me, Skipper---
Now they feel it...down below.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
Who with?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Well, I'll be - !
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
Twombley involved?
Tell me.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
You heard the news.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
He's on to us!
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
You might not kill it.
You played for the Sox?
Really.
They said.
Safety on?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You stayed away?
What blood?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Sure you did.
Those are the Hoyts.
Do what?
You know.
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
It's not that.
What then?
No.
Yes.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
It's pretty old.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Okay.
That's illegal, you know.
I know.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
I want to go home.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Something bugging you?
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You and Mel Gordon?
Lillian!
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
How's she doing?
You okay?
Forget it.
You don't mean that.
Call me.
This is nuts.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
There's a furnace.
Coffee's perked.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Jack?
The other guy.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Just do it.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Where's Ma?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Bang!
Rolfe.
Who?
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
The night before the shooting.
Yeah, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
I'm sure he's busy.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Some kids were teasing you?
Mom?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
You read my mind.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Got it.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Yes, Mr. President.
That's affirmative.
Nine.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Jim...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Stop.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Thank you for calling the white House...
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
IT'S OPEN!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I was reading too.
Did you feel that?
Yes I did...
Oveur.
Dunn.
Elaine.
Ted, what's wrong?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, we're taking off!
Not now, Elaine!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
Set!
Now!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
I think so.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
All right.  Here.
You're sure?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You can't go in there!
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Ah, won't you sit down?
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Surely there must be something you can do.
Can't you take a guess?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Ted...
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
See them, Elaine?
You promise you'll write.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Hi!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
Kill them both.
Here?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Nothing.
Get the picture?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Uh, Matthew...
But I-- .
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Who is he?
Yeah... I know the routine.
You are married?
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
We?  You've taken it?
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.

Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
... It's Harcourt.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Ss'kya'ta'.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Departmental policy.
Get outta there!
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Movement!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'll go.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You did okay, Bishop.
No.  There's no way!
You son of a bitch.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Still nothing from the colony?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
I don't know.
I told them to fall back...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
The corner!  Ready?
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
They'll get us.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Locked.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Fuck you.
It's inside the complex.
Thanks.
Range twenty meters.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
You promise?
Cross my heart.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Where is she?
Gone.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
That's right.
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Maestro.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Where?
In a harem.
A brothel.
Oh!
What does he look like?
Don't bother!
What?
No, she's fine.
What is it?
Now?
Yes!
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
No!
What does she want?
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
You're not going to do this?
No one.
I'm not telling you.
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
I can't write it!
Why not?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
What do you mean?
Not at all.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Just one year.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
What? On one hearing only?
Yes, indeed.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Why are you here?
Is she not here?
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
Pupils?
Yes.
Yes.
Why not?
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Well?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Leave that alone!
Wolfi!
Put it down!
No.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Really?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
Whom did they choose?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
What exactly are you working on?
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
A Mass for the dead.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
You mean she's not coming back?
Do you mean that?
Shall I answer it?
The man. He's here.
Finish what?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Oh, yes.
Strange!
What time?
I think so.
It couldn't be simpler.
With the tenors.
Do you have me?
I think so.
You go fast!
Do you want to rest a bit?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Here in Vienna.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
You cannot say that!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I did.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
Are you absolutely sure?
Where?
What anger?
About the ballet.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Here I am, my angel.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
That lady is back, sir.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Bene.
The American? Yes, duck.
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
No, why?
Is David acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
I beg your pardon?
What?
Mr. Kessler?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me Alex.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Not just a patient -- me.
I'm a werewolf.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Of course.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
But...
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
Feeling better?
No.
No what?
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Miss Price.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Oh, come on, tell us.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
There were witnesses?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Jack.
Well, I like it here.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Okay.
What about it?
Right.
Jack, we'd better go.
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
Yeah?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
No, but he was on the moors.
Shit! David, what is that?
I don't know. Come on.
What's the plan?
It's in front of us.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
You really scared me, you shithead.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
David!
It's you, David.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Jack, are you really dead?
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You look awful.
Because this must be stopped.
Excuse me.  Yes?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Remember the Alamo?
And what, Sergeant?
Yes - sure—
He has?
How much?
Charlie!
Mr. Dickson in yet?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Oh!
You understand?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Well, you can. You always could.
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Well—
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Now?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Shall we let the people come in?
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Happy now?
Why - well, I—
Where is he now?
Good morning, Helen.
Yes?
Helen!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
I haven't any.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
The lobby's half filled now.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, sir.
Is it safe?
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Why?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars—
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
—for the rheumatism, you know.
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then who changed it?
What time did you get in?
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Everybody in?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
We got a problem here, brother?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
What have you done?
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
He's not bad at it.
You have no shame.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What you sayin' boy?
Ride with me, cousin?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
I got seven thousand.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
I got us through the War all right.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Dammit!
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
Where is Jesse James?
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
Where the hell were you?
Web died fighting?
Distracting enough for you?
Mm-hmm.
I reckoned.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
You know him?
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Jesse, we're outlaws.
You've killed your fair share of men.
We're drunk.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Uncle Frank?
Did you kill Yankees?
A fair number, Ma.
Ma! Please!
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Doc Mimms will --
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Not if I find the right girl.
Sparkling rocks?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Hmm.
Stop it. This is just sad.
Don't turn around.
Don't swear.
We're moving you tomorrow.
Last February?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I figured.
That's what I would have done.
I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard.
Now let's have a drink.
I like that.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
... too young for whisky...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
They had to be dealt with!
There's only four of them...
Yes sir.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
THEN WHO DID?!
Your men knew the risks.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
This is him.
This is no game.
So you can't tell me anything?
Can't you tell me anything?
So he's won.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
Pumpkin?
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Eight?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Are we here?
This is Dorsia?
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Take it off.
That's nice.
I never knew you smoked.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Evelyn?
Is your Evian spiked?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
I want a firm commitment.
You're really serious, aren't you?
But what about the past? Our past?
Where are you going?
Because he dated her.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
What exactly do you mean?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
What's that, a gram?
Leaving what?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
When?
After six.
Just...say...no.
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Who?
Jean?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Sorry. 
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Why?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
So, what do you do?
A model? An actor?
That's...that's too bad.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Next Saturday?
Uh huh?
Don't tell him you're here.
Who?
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No. I'm okay.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
You sure?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
We were both seven in 1969.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Nothing.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
And?
I've questioned him.
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
What am I gonna do?
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Hey, Halberstam?
No, Owen.
Is that a raincoat?
You are a fanatic.
You don't wanna move, do you?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
He's your boss. He's not your --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
...Whaddo I do?
Nothing.
...Why?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Look at this.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Is it your software?
Milo? I'm Danny.
He's pretty tight with his family.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
How's it going?
Milo. What's up?
I heard what happened.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
That's great! Thanks.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Let's go.
Wait... He knows.
Gary?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
They'd frame him.
...Milo?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
You mean -- break in?
Why were you snooping in my office?
I told Teddy about you.
That's lame, isn't it?
It's three years old, it --
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
Is that how Larry feels?
I met this girl.
I don't know.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
Speaking of which...
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
Who're these guys?
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
To my health.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
She's working on another lead right now.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Yes?
Be careful.
What's the other?
Carnies.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Be careful.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
That does not compute.
Why not? It's a question.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Excuse me?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
He's too well-protected right now.
I don't get it.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
I'm sorry.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Who?
Does that make you horny?
Shut up.
Are you crazy?
I have something to tell you.
Lay it on me.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Ow! You shot me!
My son?
Quite impressive.
Sea bass.
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
What did you say?
Great.
How's Austin?
He's asleep.
Well, it's kind of weird.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't label people here, Scott.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.

You
Have we met?
Promised? Who promised?
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
You are female?
Then you can't come in.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
My father always wanted a boy.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
No thanks.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
What on earth?
Is that written in his shoe?
Not quite. This is my field.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Is that what you think?
This must be the last straw.
Steed ... !
You followed me.
Orders.
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
No, after you.
You don't trust me?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
It's called Black Leather.
You first.
I'll be back ...
Mrs. Peel?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Who's now vanished.
I was getting to it.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
Where?
Are you alright, young man?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Man, you're losing your audience.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
And...
I want Debbie.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Seventy-five hundred.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
The best.
I love that car.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Hello?
Yes I did.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Nice shot.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Cole, we've got to talk.
I'm going now, Cole.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Huh? Wha...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I can't trust you!
I don't believe you.
Let's get naked.
Are you okay?
Ilene, are you crazy?
A strange wang right in my palm.
I hope Ilene's all right.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
That's it, prick lips.
Give him the works.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
That's it.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
What the hell are you doing?
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
He look familiar?
Hey, you guys...
Reach out and snort someone.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
It doesn't go like that.
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Ya love it, probie?
Hey.
This?
Thanks for the insight.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I saw it.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
I know.
-- What were they doing there?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Brian.
You're back.
You look great.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Hey.
You think that's really any of your business?
Thanks for the invite.
Then why did you quit?
Hi.
I don't know anything about it.
What is --
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Where are you going?
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
No.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Aren't you even curious?
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Firehouse.
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
I'll be there.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
The great communicator.
I treated you better.
You want some coffee?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
Knock it off. Now.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Inspector.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Are you all right, honey?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
Me?
All right. What are you gonna do?
Are you sure?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
What money?
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Keep trying.
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Well you did.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
Delacroix.
What do I do?
What do you do?
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
No offense.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
To what?
Mantan?
How you sound?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
What are there character traits?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I love you too, Daddy.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Which one is your brother?
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Same here.
I thought it was appropiate.
Why'd you do that?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
Yes, your name?
He, I'm Mona.
Can I kiss you too?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
I feel fine.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, your father called.
He said that?
Yes he did.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
No.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Let Myrna finish.
I never had a really real pair before.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
I don't know who I am.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Oh you do, huh?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
No, before my time.
Why don't you call him?
Y'know what?
And?
And what?
Just ask me what you want to know.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
You can go now.
Where are you bound for?
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
I have acted as I think fit.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Your honor must lower his voice.
I have no luggage.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
I believe they will deport you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you not a man whom you value?
You want my heart?
It is my only object.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
As much as possible.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
All the same, you must name an amount.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, papa.
Papa?
Is he all right, papa?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Can I at least have a drink?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Bill Styles...
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Yeah, right...
I just don't like it.
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
That son of a bitch.
I apologize --
You saw West's body.
You saved Kendall's life --
We're not finished yet --
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Cadet, what's your name!
Jesus, what happened?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Right?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Mueller.
That's exactly what he says about you.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
I... I don't know...
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
But you didn't.
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
Yeah.
Ah, Christ
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
Something like that. You?
I plan to grow on you.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
That bugs you too?
We're fucked, I know --
Are you sure?
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah.
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No bodies, no West...
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Think it'll work?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Pike and I got separated --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Wait --
Who, Levi --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
What do you think?
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Thank you.
You were expecting me?
You won't find a better place!
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
I brought it.
Bloom!
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did you see that woman?
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
You must be Edward Bloom.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
Hi. How are you feeling?
I was dreaming.
Spooning the sherbet.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
There was one time when I was eleven...
I like your stories.
Okay.
What did she say?
You think I'm up for it?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
What did he say?
Really.
When did you ever work in an office?
Dad?
Son?
Dad!
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
Like this.
Where are we headed?
You say...
It's unbelievable.
They're your favorite flower.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Oh. Oh.
I'm going to check on him.
You need to go.
I'm going with you.
You don't have to.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Mom?
You first.
What for?
You know what for.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Yes.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
Say thank you.
What? What are you doing?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What did he say?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
What was that?
Oh nothing.
No. It's not that.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Just leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?
Yes.
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
"Frenzy".
What's wrong?
It's makes it easier. Okay.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
And? What are you saying?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Some... What does that mean?
So now you hate all women?
What?
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
I don't have nothing.
No.
Are you scared?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
What does it mean?
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
What are you doing?
Yeah, I know.
Angela?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Is your niece older than 12?
This gonna get you in trouble?
This was very sweet of you.
I bet you have loyal customers.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
Hi.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
Holy shit.
The fuck you laughin' at?
Better?
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
Let me say somethin' first...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Want another?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Still makin' jokes?
Tell me what to do.
What is it?
By myself?
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Shit. Who hasn't?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
How a girl get like that?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Rae don't do this now...
Hey.
Holy shit!
I feel better. Do you?
What happened to your face?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
Thought you had a man for that.
The hell you call me?
What's this?
Back-up.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
What are you doing?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's go.
Nick, we can't just --
Let's grab some food.
This the right place?
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Joyce can be nice.
You cool, Ich?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Give me a break, would you?
Are you expecting anyone?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
What'd I tell you?
Did I say that?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
She disappeared... shit!
Nick --
I want to yank Kobo.
Where does this Sugai live?
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Big enough.
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
Start it.
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
Thank you.  You have one?
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
What's that for?
You all right?
Yes...
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't give him any more.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
Don't be an ass.
He's on duty.
Where's Ich?
And I'm supposed to care?
He drinks.
Where's the wife?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
We're in?
You'll get Ich killed.
What if I chant?
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
This is my stop.
I'm amused.
This by this...
It's not your job.
I want a gun.
It is not allowed.
Could you fill me in?
I want him.
You trust me?
That wasn't our deal.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
He knows what he's doing.
Where?
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
One man.  He must be good.
Then go get him.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
I've done some questionable things.
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
Show me something?
Like what?
Of course not.
He could?
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Industrial refuse.
I didn't like her.
Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
You equipped for random questions?
Why, yes, of course.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
I think I have no money.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Shot of vodka, please.
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
You want to see my friends?
Those cockroaches?
Prosit.
I like you.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
How old am I?
No.  I got a problem.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What the fuck for?
It's a good job.
Does it eat?
Jeezus!
It's artificial?
Are you apprehensive?
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
I've already got more help than I need.
Yeah.
I can imagine.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Who is this?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
They could clean around the arrangement.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
You're sick, Deckard.
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What difference will it make?
What's up?
Thanks.
If she is, the machine works.
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
A tortoise.  What's that?
Of course.
What's your name?
Where are your folks?
They left.
Whatcha doin'?
You look... better.
Beautiful.
Twenty.
Methuselah Syndrome.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
I'm Adam Webber.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
My office.
For how long?
Please excuse this interruption.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Get out of here!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
You don't?
Yes.
And that's it?
Wait!  Wait!
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Oh, I could die...
Hey, what are you doing?!
I can't, it's yours.
Why are you doing that?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
No.
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
My Mom and Dad.
Wait! Wait!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
I guess we'll need another locker.
A wife?
Yes.
Bites what?
The big one!
It does?
They're all divorced?
One who's not a mutant.
Of course.
Now, get out!!
Yes, ma'am!
You almost got us killed!
I was wrong!!
Yes!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Sure.
No!  Not crazy!
What about her?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
I know first aid!
There.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
What?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Then why go there?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
That's what everybody believes?
I love Lucy!
What's the capitol?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Yeah.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Almost all of them.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
Good-bye, Adam.
Of what?
My father is a genius.
You don't look thirty-five.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
What?  What is it?!
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Hello.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Well, where are you --
No.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
Good god.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
No.  They all do.
You hear that?!
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Home sweet home!
The locks.
Thirty -five years!
To go up.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Oh, no.
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
If I...you know...
Calvin?!
Watch this!
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
What did you wish for, Adam?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
We stay down here.
Yes.
Well, I am the head of this household--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Give me your hand.
You're serious, aren't you?
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Well, what do you think?
That water's freezing!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Where are you going?
To bed.
Yes, you do!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Oh, no!
Give it back to him.
Have him committed.
We came back to the house!
Adam!!
Where?!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey?
What color is it?
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Well.
THEN WHAT?
What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Do you like me?
Do you know?
No.
You don't?
Hi, can I come in?
Nice guy. Who's he?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.
No.
Don? Are you in with them?
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
Do you like my body?
I'm doing it.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
Oh no.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Hold me, Don.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Bull.
Alright, suit yourself.
Hello, daddy.
MOMMY!
Mommy's here.
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
No thanks. What does that mean?
Go where?
There ya go.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hi Dad.
Uh-uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What else is new? Right?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
What happened to him?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Oh, okay, can I call?
What's with Mike?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Did you see her undressed?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
Okay, be careful.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
What am I going to do?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Yeah.
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Dorothy Vallens?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Go ahead.
Sandy?
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
I need Il Duce.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Look under the body.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
We're here brother.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
No ma! No!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Hey Murphy?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
I don't know they just always need it.
Nervous?
A bit.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
He isn't to be touched.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Rule of thumb?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
They were wearing masks.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
What?
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
So what are you thinkin' here?
The what man?
The Greeks. The Italians.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hello?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Hello?
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
This is some crazy shit, man!
Liberating isn't it?
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Hello? You there?
You believe?
Yes.
You feel?
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.
Loop around real fast.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
What's wrong with him?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Hi.
Which one was that?
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
She doesn't need to know.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
We've got sixteen dollars.
I know.
How much?
She needed it.
That's what she is!
When'd you get back?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
What's happening? What's going on?
It's going back down.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Help me move him.
Where's Kumar?
What are you doing?
Wait for Kumar.
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Like amnesia.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
Why?
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Where?
What's he in for?
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Exactly. Woah.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Future Man.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Could you grow cinnamon?
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
See you.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You think he got my license plates?
Bob, where you going?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Was Future Man adopted?
Give him a second.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Jesus, Bob.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
You're Anthony?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that him?
That's Anthony.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Are you a fag?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
That never would of --
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
What was that all about?
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Where'd she go?
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
I paid for it.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
How much is there?
Bob, will you please listen?
Way to go, Bob!
Is he chasing us?
It's registered in my mother's name.
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Dignan.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
I'm sorry, Bob.
Scarecrow?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
The elevator broke.
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
Hold on --
Here we go.
Wait a second --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
How you doing, Bob?
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Is he good?
Yes.
Why?
Where did he go?
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where's that guy going?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
What?
No. Just pool.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Never heard of it.
And what are we looking for?
Sorry to wake you.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
Sir...
Show me again...
Then what?
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I have to go now.
Is this really happening?
I emptied it.
Felt a little light.
Front. Use your teeth.
Conklin.
I don't know.
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
You called it in?
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
You drive.
Switch! You drive!
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I love you, too.
I wanted to kill him.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
What is this, a game?
So when was I here?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
It's me.
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Sounds like a threat.
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
You're sure?
Here?
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
That's where we came out.
Mr. Nevins?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
So he fooled you.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I'll wait... back there.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Test of manhood.
You'll move
Good to see you again.
A common thief.
We must run in different directions!
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Thank you for accepting.
I want... to marry you!
I... accept your proposal!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Then when?
And I with you. But you must wake.
I am the Princess of Wales.
Peace is made is such ways.
You will die! It will be awful!
We can't stop!
Come, it'll help you sleep.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I don't know... I don't remember.
How long will I be in here?
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Are you hurting her?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
What do you want to know, Evan?
So it didn't feel... weird?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Are you okay?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Smells like sex in here.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Look what you made me do!
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
I thought I was the bad guy!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Monsieur Rick?
I came with Captain Renault.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He did. Captain Renault did.
Does he know that?
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Yes, Monsieur.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
I won't.
Goodnight.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Here's to you, sir.
Er, good luck, yes.
I'd better be going.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
We said "no questions."
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Has it got a wow finish?
How did you get in?
Richard, I had to see you.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But why my name, Richard?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
You are very kind.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
What happened with Rick?
Did he give any reason?
Ilsa, I --
Sam?
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We'll come again.
My office.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I beg your pardon?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
I understand.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
We'll be there.
May we proceed with the business?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
I believe you have a message for him?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ho, diplomatist!
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Victor Laszlo.
Manages what?
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Oh, thanks.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Our expenses?
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
Give me another.
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
Put that phone down!
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I like it fine here.
Boss!
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It's bad.
Save some for tomorrow.
Feels so good to lie here.
Can't.  Need water.
Do too much, I'll die.
Do too little you'll die.
Take it.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
What's so damn funny?
You know what happened to this?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
What brings you out to the sticks?
How was Russia?
You don't seem too happy about it.
He is a cute thing.
He's your cute thing.
You know, for when you travel.
You can't go now.
I have to.
There isn't any us.
Get back?  From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --
Her name's Hannah.
There was a coffin?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You okay?
I love you, Chuck.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
If you say you are.
You're Chuck Noland.
What happened to your pants?
Don't you even think about it.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
How about we go somewhere else?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
To Wilson.
To life.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
Thanks.  For everything.
Only if you can afford it.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
So, Mrs...
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
People watched the movies in their cars?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
It will be okay.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
"...did." Well, okay.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
I thought they might take me.
They wanted a girl.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She looks after other people's children.
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Did you bite it?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Where are you going?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
They're migrants.
It's almost like flying.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
First pregnancy?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Nobody's named this one yet.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I thought it was my turn.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
What's that?
Do you like to read?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
That's *it*?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Don't this place look like home?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Where do you think you're going?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
The standard ten.
Know who I am, Jake?
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
We were back on.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
I told you, use less powder.
It can buy you a new and better you.
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She up for this?
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
I can't do that.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
How much?
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Something stupid.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
What about Customs?
I don't trust anyone.
He's gone.
Look at you... You want to go.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Do you have something to prove?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
What about...
What about what?
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Stop waving that thing around.
We're working for the King.
Uh...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
I'm sorry.
What?
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Then who's the Banker?
It's not history.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
You guys awake?
Peace of mind.
You sell it.
It's just insurance.
I'm Bella.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
My car's in the garage.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
I got scared.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Eight-fifty.
I want a job, Giles.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Good night?
Not particularly.
I couldn't resist them.
You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.
Where did you get it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I've got something to tell you.
I've got a job.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
What's the time?
You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.
I loved it blond.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Are you drunk?
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't like it.
The door, Jack.
Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Why did you take the money?
I want to buy a car.
Great.
Found a job?
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
Near the casino.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
Just an accident. Nothing.
He doesn't gamble.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
What kind of trouble?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
They mean it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Next time it'll be my neck.
How much do you owe?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I'm sorry.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
And your hand too.
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Detective Inspector Ross.
Who...
Have I?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Where do you live, Jack?
Nice car.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
I put them on together.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Where did you go to school?
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
We do. 
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
You want me to check?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Girlfriend?
Does he win?
Thanks for the information.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
It didn't go off.
Oh, God...
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What the hell?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Check at six minutes.
Energy shielding positive function.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
Right!
Why don't you have more time?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Pinback...
Doolittle...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Fred.
Out where?
Veil nebula.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- Remark.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
You know what I think about, Talby?
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle! Help me.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Commander? Are you still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
I'm on a break.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
How come I never hearda you before?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
You mean until you showed up?
What is it?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
What're you looking for?
I don't get involved with guns.
You're light a deuce.
You didn't...
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
Can you help me get her back?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
When?
Soon, baby.
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
I won't be staying.
It was open.
Bent?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You need to get out more.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
What's this?
I don't know what to say.
Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.
None.
Who is it?
A friend of your fiance's.
You're also a fool.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's odd...
A little what?
Gotta go.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
And because he's my friend.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Only one I can think of.
Not right now.
I actually know how this works.
And she bought that?
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Playing hooky again?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
We gotta talk.
You left out condescending.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Okay, okay, okay--
I was on call. 
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
He's sick.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
No problem.
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
Right, slow...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Now, how are we gonna do this?
What the fuck!
No... You don't think...?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Jam, listen up.
It's my Bullworker.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Oh, hi, mom.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
That's it?
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I did?
Good morning, mongrels!
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Hi... what's going on here?
What was his name?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Like a spear.
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
What did you say?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
I am so sorry.
Hey...
Hey...
You're weird.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Donnie?
And what?
That's alright... I understand.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Come with me.
No. Frank.
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Know what?
You're my only son...
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
So, I met a new friend.
Don't you watch the news?
He said to follow him.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Four times... so far.
How does that make you feel?
The good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What else makes you feel regret?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
When will this happen?
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
I can see him right now!
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Yeah.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
No more fuckin' for her.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
Really, Loretta?
This came for you, sweetie.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Amber? Here.
Yah?
Mrs. Leeman?
C'mere. I love you so much.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.
Hi...
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
Oh, naw. Hi.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
That's right.
Okay?
Yeah.
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Oh! What is it?
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Harold!
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
Take a letter.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Here I am, Father...
Send for my car...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Father...
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
What kind of a dog is he?
Well - what is he now?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
Give me that again!
Once more! 
Then it's war?
Bah!! 
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No, that wasn't it...
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.
One or two?
They have noble faces.
You won't be long?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
You stay with me.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Yes?
I found it.
What is it?
Like this. 
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What happened?
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
You don't own this man!
Good morning, Treves.
You've acquired a taste for this?
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you.
How long has this man been here?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
I don't know what I've got.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
You've never been?
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
You alright?
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Thank you... very much.
What's this?
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Yyyess.
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Good evening. How are you feeling?
Yes.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Oh yes.
Who are they of?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
Good morning, John.
Yes, John?
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Very smart indeed.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Are you the proprietor?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Right! Where is he?
It's all right! It isn't happening!
WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
WHY?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
"The fifth one this week"!
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
I'll bring it back.
But you don't realize....
Yes -- I believe you do.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
What do you see, Erik?
I see the world.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is there nothing men can do?
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
REALLY?
We're just not a very musical nation...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Don't talk nonsense.
What about the raping?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Scream.
Ah.
Louder.
Aaagh! Rape!
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
But...
What are you talking about?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
We're missing all the fun...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
She got me thinking...
I... I... KILLED her...
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
What did he say?
You must help us.
Why should WE care?
But you're the Gods!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
I've got you!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
What's the matter with them?
Just say something cheerful.
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What do you think?
Well, what else do we do?
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I AM one, Dad!
ROW!
Hy-Brasil?
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
Bye... sorry...
What do we have to do?
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Same thing, isn't it?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
What are you talking about?
Well! Come on!
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
My brother blacksmiths!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Sh! Hurry!
Relax!
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
Not now, Sven...
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He drove me mad!
Well... I'm game.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
And keep your sword greased.
Yeah, you told me that later.
And I just liked you so much.
Ms. Kruczynski?
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
You were not.
In the room?
Come up to Boston with me?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
How are you today?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I don't really know how --
I don't know what that means.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
It's okay.
I'm not a stalker.
You know Wilmont?
So you like bookstores, huh?
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Ready for another?
Well, I should probably get going.
Okay.
Yeah.
When?
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
I don't want to talk about this here.
More?
Joely...
What if you hide me?
There's this guy!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
This is our first "date" date.
Naomi, I guess.
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I'm sure, I said.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Well, you're married.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Hi there.
You know what I did.
Oh God, how horrid.
I know.
What do we do?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I think she's great.
I think, before.
Male or female?
Bye, Joel.
Yeah.
When?
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were a bully...
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I don't know.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I guess so.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Hi, it's Joel.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi.
I just got in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I should maybe talk to you.
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I had a good time last night. I really did.
We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
It's just... y'know... I mean...
It's freezing out.
It's stopped.
Well, what should we do?
He's coming?
You better go.
How did I look?
Oh.
What do you want, Stan?
What's this?
I know what it is.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary...
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
It's no big deal.
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
Mary. What are you doing here?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
The voltage looks fine.
Does that help?
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Clockworks.
What do you believe in then?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I don't.
No, I guess not.
What do you think?
I have to go, Julian.
Are you in show business?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Time to play Spam in the can.
We have a man down...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
What?
Coffee.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
What...?
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Does he know that?
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I found one.
Alive?
...how's the client?
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
If it worked.
The date.
What do you want me to say?
Don't... don't do this...
Then who the fuck are you?
What are you?
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Jesus...
Yes, sir.
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
It is now.  We're locked in.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain Miller, you copy?
Smith, get out of there...
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
How much oh-two do we have?
Maybe one of the original crew?
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
What's going on in there, Starck?
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Weir.
He's been past Mars?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
He's engaged the override.
It's cold.
Where is she?
The safety circuit's failed!
Explosive decompression.
Get them back --
What is it?
What is it?
How'd you know it was me?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
What are you doing here?
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
What did you wish for, honey?
I can't take this.
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
We had a tough year.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
You're hot!
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
I'm driving.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Leonard, how's the feed?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Feeling better?
Which was?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
That's what we're here to find out.
And reverse the mutations --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I can... make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Please don't make this personal --
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
I can't find it, mon!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
Hi, Brad.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
They were left over from the last shift.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Leave me alone.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Do you have any ice tea?
You're a really good kisser.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I didn't see you this morning.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Hey, Rat.
Yo.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
No Damone. I don't understand.
You're losing it, Damone.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
How often do you go?
Who's that?
Seen the new Playboy?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
My brother's car!
Just be glad you're all right.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
No way! He just called him a dick.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Well I never did it.
Was it great?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
What do you think it is?
What do you want?
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
But what are you going to do?
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
If you graduate.
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
That's a nice shirt.
Are you really nineteen?
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you know what you want?
Are you all right?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Do you want to come inside?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
...I've got to go home.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What about the notes?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Let's have lunch!
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Dobermans don't talk.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Naw! Not a major.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Oh, my God!...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Why?
Not much. Why?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
How about a check?
Plans?
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Where'd you get this?
Some of what?
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The airport is over there!
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
I will not die because of him!
You know where it is?
Where are you two going?
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Well, it don't look pretty.
I don't think you should...
We shot a skunk.
Where's that?
Wha?
They're right here.
Fuck you too.
Scared?
Ohhh.
What?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Your brother, huh?
Your parents of relation?
We gotta try.
What's in the back?
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
Fully.
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Bullshit.
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
SHIT.
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
Am I too heavy for you?
OH JESUS!
Yeah, I'll go.
What's wrong?
DON'T!
And the last one is the...
Hold it!
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Oh my God... What is that?
I'm fine, I really am.
Did we make it?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
What're you doing?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I guess so, sir.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
I'm not!
You're afraid!
Madam...?
Hello, Harold.
Frances.
He's not here.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
An actress.
I know, but --
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
GET OUT!
You learn your lines?
Sort of.
...Yes.
Without me.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
You wrote it, didn't you?
What do I do, Dad?
And you think it's worth all this?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Please, Francie...
Bread?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Age?
Fifteen.
You can always come see it in London.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
...Not if I can help it.
They'll mend.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Harry.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
You think I'd miss it?
How'd I look?
Frances...
Oh no...
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Harry... I met someone.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Well, the studio told me not to.
The hell you will, Harry York.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
What's left of my blood.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
I should've known...
That's right.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
What's that?
To quarter-horses.
What's that?
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
I love you, Harry. I love you.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
No.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
That would be okay.
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Yeah.
Shit!
...Is that not true?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What happened? Who're you?
Who're you?
How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
I don't care.
It's okay.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Then why did you bring them?
What?
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Don't... talk crazy.
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Excuse me.
Don't I know you?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
And what's that?
...Did you really say that?
Is there something else?
Symington says...
What?
Yes.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Why... her?
What is this?
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
You dance so beautifully together.
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I'll have to do better than that.
I've loved you all my life
Brother and sister still?
You make me weak.
Our decision. Together.
Your decision. For us.
Victor. I love you,
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Why the change? What about your work?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Brother and sister no more.
It's going to ram us.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Professor?
I am not mad.
Henry Clerval.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Quite a place.
Thank you, Henry.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Professor Waldman.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Who are you?
The killer is still out there.
Tomorrow is another day.
Melvin Belli.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Good night, Alice.
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Next Friday.
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
How the... did he get in there?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
Jack?
Marcie?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
You said we were special.
Claudette...
Somebody'll see.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
I had to.
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
What hath God wrought?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
I love you.
What about Neddy?
Ned!
Mmmmmmmph?
Best over...
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Anything else you want?
I got to.
How much do I owe you?
That's thirty percent.
Good luck.
Another coincidence.
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Yeah, follow us.
What's this guy's problem?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
What's your name?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Not a chance.
Who's this?
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
To your family.
In the Winnebago.
Did he...?
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
I promise.
No!
Mexico.
What's in Mexico?
What did I say?
Daddy's dead.
Watch my back!
I'm sorry.
See ya.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
You can't come in here.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
You believe me don't cha?
Gotcha!
All I'm saying --
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Where's the woman?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
Keep your voice down.
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you think?
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
Thank you, ensign.
I've been accused of that wish.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
No, sir.
Straight up?
Permission to leave, sir?
Ah, c'mon...
Fine by me, sir!
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Shit.  Think we're had.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Yes?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
Uh, question, ma'am.
You know him.
I'm sure it is.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
O'Neil?
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
"In Washington..."
They're more afraid of you.
He was married?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Do you, uh, know...
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
'Cool?
Say again, sir?
"Dad."
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Do you?
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Clear.
We're fucked.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Subject?
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Me!? You where the one...
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I'll take them all.
...he's pregnant.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
How do you know?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
What the hell are you doing?
What's it to you?
Can I use some?
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
I can't.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Oh, I'm not married.
Not for a long time, now.
Merde!
Where's Luc and Pierre?
You're fast.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Do I know you?
We've met before.
Sounds like a big company.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
What's with the chewing gum?
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
It's Raymond.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
You WILL go out there.
"The show must go on."
God, what an ass.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
What?  What?
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Not again...
What the hell is going on?!!?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
Oh my god, It's real.
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
I don't know.
No I didn't.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Lt. Madison, GO.
Shit! Go!
Up.
What's the weather like outside?
There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
A hologram...
As good as Hopkins?
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Where are the miners?
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Only answers to me.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
You're playing your good side.
Jason.. Can you hear me?
What?  What did he say?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We pretend...
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
"Deception..." "Lies."
A model, only as big as this.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Okay... On what?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Continue forward, sir?
Because they're coming right at us.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Over three hundred miles.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Is that a fact.
The army needs you.
Well, George, who were you?
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
A lot of years have gone by.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
How old are you, Captain?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Oh, come now...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
Unofficially, General Greene.
The man is a traitor!
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
I want you to see our hospital.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
General Greene?
George, you know I only love you, but...
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
That's good... who?
All people have rights!
Who says so?
I say!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
What is this?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
You get the money?
You get life for kidnapping.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
What's this movie you're doing first?
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
There's Ilona.
What about her?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I need the money.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
Karen? You okay?
You know Laurel Canyon?
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Okay. So who are you?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Yeah? Which terminal?
Who the fuck are you?
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You live in Miami?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You have a card in here?
That's what I'm doing.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Ever shot anybody.
What's it called?
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
What Get Away jet?
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Martin, look at me.
How about this?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
What's that?
You've been losing.
It's all mine.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You been here the whole time?
Then you've read it?
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
I told you not to -–
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You seem to feel fine about it.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
I don't have a dog.
Harry -–
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
'We?'
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
A passenger liner. Over.
How about now?
Sixty pounds.
I don't know. Tuesday?
One more?
Maureen.
What?
Roger.
Roger?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Guess I'll just keep working.
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
Smokes?
Try Wednesday.
Dodge.  Dodge.
Get up.
If you get it back in one piece.
What is it?
What's this?
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long?
Three, four days.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Dodge to Murphy.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I think you know.
You smashed it!
Don't lie to me!
Conveniently enough for you.
You're late.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Then why didn't they take it.
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
Coffee?
She was sailing up north, right?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
There's somebody else on this boat.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Hey.
Hey.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Showing you what?
Victims of what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps? You there?
What happened?
We hit land.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Greer to Murphy.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Too deep to anchor out there.
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Greer?
How're you feeling?
What happened?
It's a Noaa buoy.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
What about the gold?
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Better late than never.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Who?
How should I know?
Who?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
But I can't --
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what can you tell us about this... 
Who is this, Enid?
Well, yes...
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
It's not optional!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi Josh.
Hi... what's up?
Then why do you hate me so much?
Hi Enid.
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Okay, okay!
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Does Oomie really like this show?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Where are we going?
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
I didn't get it either.
Ew ... when did you get that?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I totally, totally hate you.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
Where?
Anthony's II!
That guy is totally amazing.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
He gives me a total boner!
...maybe we should be lesbos...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Go ahead...
No, really...
Look, we have to get these...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
Nothing.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
So, whaddya think?
What time?
Do you want anything?
What about me? Am I not even here?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Seymour does.
You still interested in that?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Didn't they tell you?
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
That tape sucked, by the way!
Go die, asshole!
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
What?
How much is it?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
I don't think so...
Shh!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Really?
Uh... hello?
Hi, it's me...
Oh, hi...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Boo!
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
I... I don't think so.
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah.
What do we have here, Margaret?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why would she be hiding from me?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
Morning, friend, glorious day.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Starting now, we attack them.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Understand, I had help-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Very good indeed.
I don't suppose I could watch.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
John, it will not be easy.
But you said they were always old.
What a good week.
What did I do?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
What happened to them?
Good luck.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Does he ever mention me?
No, you didn't, Frank.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I'll do it.
That's where the buggy stopped.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
That's a terrible thing to say.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
These boys aren't playing around.
Can I have some of your water?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Egon!
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
I'm Egon --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Oh, hiya, Pete.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
And now you're going to eat it?
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Ready?
I'm ready.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
No, I just thought --
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
And pure --
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Now where are you going?
Ready?  What is it?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
You really don't act like a scientist.
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
Well, let's check it out.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
That's it.  Get out.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
All right.
Great rehearsal.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I think it's the food of the future.
Die in what sense?
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
A square?
Two wavy lines?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Oh!  You're here.
I'm always serious.
Something was definitely here.
Don't cross the beams.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Where's the Keymaster?
Who?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Life is just a state of mind.
Set entry grid.
What do you mean by "seen?"
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Ray -- Something's here.
Where are you, Pete?
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
Agile bastard, isn't he?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
And the seas would boil ...
Judgement Day ...
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
If I may be so bold...
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
That's difficult to say, general.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
They won't break this one.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
I've read of it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
You cannot die.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The Senators admire you.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
My troops don't make policy.
He's very realistic.
Greeks?
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.
You need to come home!
Let him trust Quintus.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Hello.
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
No -- why should I?
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
No, I couldn't.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Do you?
Yes.
Yes.
You do?
What is it?
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
GET OUT!
Don't cry. 
I'm meeting someone.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Here? In Berkeley?
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
Because -- I am.
What do you think?
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
What?
I don't understand --
What did she say?
But Elaine --
Benjamin?
You won't?
I don't know.
But you might.
Yes.
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why do you have to see him?
Benjamin?
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Thank you.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
You a student?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
I'm putting it here by the door.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Can I help you, sir!
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Oh no.
Is it a girl?
Is what a girl?
In general.
You don't?
No. 
Thank you.
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Drink?
What do you think of me?
No.
Oh my God.
Like what?
What do you think?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
What is wrong with me?
Yes.
Benjamin?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Hello, Benjamin.
How are you?
May I have a drink?
I haven't. No.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Now?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Benjamin.
To tell you?
The number.
Well.
Why don't you watch?
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Thank you.
This is all terribly wrong.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That you're afraid --
Oh my God.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
Yes I do.
What one.
There!
There isn't any.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Right.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Man, is this interesting.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
No.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Yes.
At college.
Art.
Well how did it happen?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
Don't talk about Elaine.
No.
I wish you'd tell me.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
I wouldn't know.
Did I say that?
You wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
May I stay then?
This is absurd.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
I don't believe you.
I'll find her.
Very good, sir.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
What else?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
No.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
I'm just --
-- worried?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
To be what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Oh no.
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
I will.
But why?
You miss the point.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?
The Carlsons' are here.
I don't believe it.
I want to speak --
Not now.
And what are you going to do?
Need any help?
No --
With the pearls?
I've quit.
Like dancing?
Never?
You're a fool!
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Very little.
What?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
We'll dance.
Chasing what?
Will you do me a big favor?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Going?
You live here?
For tonight. 
Oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Why do you look at me like that?
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
You are beautiful!
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
There.
I don't want them now.
I know.
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Oh -- yes but -- later.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I can't.
Don't.
Till then.
Thank you, sir.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Ready, Kringelein?
Is that too much, Baron?
All right then.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Hello! Hello! --
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Any letters?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Oh, I've got to find it.
Oh, don't go.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
Yes.
You dance splendidly.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh yes, of course.
What...! --
Moreover --
Moreover...
Tired?
You pay me.
Moreover...
You...
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Not too quickly.
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
How nice -- your daughters?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Yes.
Of course -- of course. 
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
You're sweet.
Come here. 
Oh, no.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Why not?
Hurry, Suzette.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Again?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You're discharged.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
-- We must do something...
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
We will wait.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Have I kept you waiting?
No news yet?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
My son --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
Well, uh... No.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
They knocked out my tooth!
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Not as tough as you, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I pay my debts.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
I've really got to --
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I can't. I just left home.
Where's the five?
Are you sure?
Roy?
Mm?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
You called the doctor, huh?
Every day in every way.
Big spender.
No.
Working the what?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
What happened to Cole?
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
What?  What for?
You were gone for a while.
I went out to Delmar.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
No! Because I --
What is it? What's going on?
I'm happy the way I am.
Roy Dillon?
I realize this is a shock.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
That's that, then.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Where?
Only the real stiffs.
That's it?
Yes.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
Detective...
A dead body?
It's Amy Kramer.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
What the --
You're twisted.
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
You stole it?
What are you doing here?!
I can see that.  Why?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
I'm okay.
Better?
Who?!
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
This kid just wants his freedom.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Hey, you alright?
Who?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Wait.
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
Better her than me.
Shane's going as a condom.
Shit, Linda!
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Thanks!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Mom -- Who is this?
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Answer what?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You've been watching too much TV.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
God, what's wrong with him?
Where's the baby?!
What now?!
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Home is important to a man.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
So long, Colonel.
You know what gets me?
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I dunno, boy.
What's funny about that?
How do you know that?
You told me.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Me?
You.
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
You're hollow, like a woman.
You're my buddy.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you--do you--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
What's good about that?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Damn.
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad?
Who was it?
Mom?
What's this?
No.
I'm talking to you gently now.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Daughter--I love you very much.
You don't even know me.
What's the matter?
Give us time.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Disease?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
What's that all about?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
We all are.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Say hello to your mother.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
I have some change!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
No.
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And no one's there now?
No you're not!
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
You're begging him to kill you?
Honor, I suppose.
No.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
She's fine.  Please--
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Hands and knees, you say?
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.
I've struck my blow.
Don Quixote.
Here.  Finish the job.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
If you want to be found that way.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
You don't know?
And you went home unannounced, too?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
Dead!
Jesus.
So long, you guys.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
I heard you were looking for me.
Because he was cruel?
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
What's this?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
I know.
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I hate that thing.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Yes, he is.
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
I don't get it.
What does he say to do?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Don't worry about it.
I hate that thing.
He isn't?
He'd assume we had.
Far as I know.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I'm sorry.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
That's the XKE.
I wish Paul luck.
They didn't murder me.
It's a jungle out there.
You know each other?
We met here earlier this evening.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Get out of here.
Do it!
Not true.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
You mean I'm black?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
You're still dressed?
Are you going to stiff me?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
How many weeks?
Yeah.
We offer...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
That's all you got, three girls?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Overpowering?
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
You making a feature?
Joanne?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
No.
You don't drink?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
At least I'm a growing person.
No.
Neither am I.
What do you care about?
What's T-J?
Tijuana.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
I can stop if you want.
You really believe all that?
It's not quite the same thing.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
What makes you so sure?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
What happened?
Where is he?
But then you'll forget about me.
Well, what do they know?
Who's paying you?
You are.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
Where is she?
I don't know.
That's like a stag film.
No.
They're legal now.
Where is she?
Who made it?
I don't know.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
Like what?
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What is it, Jake?
How's your business, Jake?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Where's Ratan?
Fifty cents admission.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
You never heard of that?
To his own daughter?
The guy who bought you that ring.
You can fuck off, too.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
No.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
We planted it.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
I'm a file clerk.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
Eh, no.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
It's very interesting.
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
All right.
Harold?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
What happened?
Look.
Over there by the courthouse.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Is he all right?
We'll come back in the morning.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
No.
Okay?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Of course.
Maude, do you pray?
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
Well, why don't you?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
Maude, I must speak to you.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Look at the stars.
Maude.
Yes.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I'm getting married.
To whom?
This is insane.
How do you do?
Would you like a cigarette?
Oh, is this your father?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Fifteen.
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Harold?
No.
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Then why did you leave?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Parasite!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
It's different for us.
Julia.
I knew you'd come.
Yes!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
What do you mean?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
O.K. Let's go.
Well... G'bye.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
I... remember.
Who?
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
hound of resurrection --
See? I don't like that --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
It's almost over!!
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
I worry about you.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Sir, may I go first??
She's dead.
I knew those men better than you did --
Each of us gets a belt.
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
Thank you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
Yes?
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
You want me to hold him down?
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
What was that??
Where do you --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Anything else you --
Not from you.
Well good n-
You better have that looked at.
Goodnight, then.
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
I like that...
Marco...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Cocky.
Strong.
He -- loves you.
I know.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Just take it slowly.
Christ!
What's the problem?
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Julia's my second wife.
The box... you opened it. We came.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
No time for argument.
Nobody escapes us.
We want the man who did this --
Please. Get back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
Julia!
No.
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
You bastard --
Poor baby.
You're Julia, right?
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Well can I come in or not?
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
...somebody...
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Later.
Not know.
You can't love him.
I don't.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Which is where?
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
Just a thought --
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Larry!
Where are you?
Well?
Why not?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
Shit.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Julia?
Are you all right?
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Who was it?
Is this upsetting you?
-- I'll go see.
Oh baby.
Don't go upstairs.
Huh?
What's wrong with you?
I don't know where to begin...
What?
Not much.
Just soda.
Plain soda?
That depends.
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Is this your place ?
Do you care ?
No personal details?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Who brought me in here?
You wouldn't believe me.
Who's there?
Kirsty?
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
Well I want you to see the house.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
You like?
Surprise.
I've forgotten.
I love you, honey.
...maybe we should never have come back.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Finished?
He's gone.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I thought we'd lost you.
It's late.
I see.
Oh no?
Oh!
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Steve. Thank God you came.
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What did I say?
I'll come back later, huh?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
We'll do it next Monday.
What did he ever do to you?
What do you mean, "what?"
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Suck my ass.
My band.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
None.  Christ!
What's up?
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
The little skate-fuckers.
No way.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Well what about the new Echo --
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
What?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
He's got one!
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
Don't do it, Rob!
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Hey, Barry.
Oh, hi.
May I help you?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Fine.  That's great.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Yeah.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Charlie.
'Morning, Dick.
I'll tape it for you.
Let's not.
Rob --!
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
It's Vince and Justin.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Shit!
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
What?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
It sounds stupid.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
We'll talk some other time.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Will you call me?
Hello.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
That bad, eh?
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Are you alright?
Pig died.
You're soaking.
I don't want to go back.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Want to know what, exactly?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
What's the difference?
No, but...
You're tougher.
More confident, maybe.
Barry said its done.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
I mean it.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Very persuasive.
Fair enough.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Enough, Liz.
So you live in Chicago now?
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Which way are you going?
That way.  You?
I'll call you.
Hi, Mom.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
I think you have more.
I'm Vince.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Claymore.
You're the expert.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Do you play?
Yes.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
Grave robbers?
Probably.
You have an active imagination.
Why not?
Where?
Who is he?
That bothers you?
What about me?
I'd rather hear yours.
No one knows you're here?
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Is this what you killed them with?
You did kill those men.
Not all of them.
It's beautiful.
That would be difficult to explain.
He knows about you.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Don't.
Come here, Brenna.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Get out.
The inheritance.
Forget it.
I'm calling an attorney.
You and I should talk first.
All fashionably without heads.
You're an asshole, Moran.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
It's that important?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
What are you doing man?
Be quiet.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
You know me home.  Me name.
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
I'm twenty-two.
What?
This is madness!
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
It will take less effort as you learn.
I'm your future husband, remember?
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Oh please.  Another one.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Far away.
Who am I deceiving?
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Your name?
What is your position?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
How many came?
The last four.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Spare a chair?
Head still secure to the neck.
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
Friend of yours?
Run!
Leave her out of this.
What's the point?
It's all we have.
Leave her alone.
We have some unfinished business.
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you know what this is?
A mystery.
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Morning Mr. North
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
What's the idea of locking this?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Oh, she was here.
Where'd she go?
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Mother? But your mother --
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Call Duffy!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You've had a better offer, eh?
What's the matter?
You can't sell me that, Walter.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Bermuda.
What's his line?
He's in the insurance business.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
You're not afraid, are you?
Now you got me.
Allow me.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Hildy!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Hildy!
What tickets?
I'm finished.
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Look at me, Hildy --
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
No, you don't! Walter!
When did you deliver this first?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Then why are you doing it?
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Walter!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
I call. What you got?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
So have we!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Goodbye, Yonson.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Little rum in yours, too?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Pete, you're through!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
I did.  Hold the wire.
We'll fix that, too. 
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
Who is this man?
That's a lie!!
Got you, Williams!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Where's the old lady?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
There goes another scrub lady.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Come on with that money!
Kings and sixes.
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother!
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Isn't that her picture?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
What's that?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Who? Me?
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
No, I don't think so.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Get out of here!
Here's the picture of my wife.
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
The door was locked.
That was a googly!
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Pauline's mum got killed.
I know a secret.
Yes.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You wouldn't.
You couldn't.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
I did see them. I did.
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
I'm starting my own collection.
Crocodiles! Aah!
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Except the servicemen.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And absent bridegrooms!
What's that?
You joined up.
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Well?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
He always knows.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Up to six weeks, I think.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
He could always make me laugh.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
You might still have a house.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What?
Cone.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
Drink up, it's party time.
Who's your Daddy!
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
What about the tree?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
He left!
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
A dead one.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Hey, great they're back.
Can I help you with something?
I was just wondering.
You know... a couple of queers.
He walks, duh.
You shouldn't a done that.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I don't drive cross country.
But if you did.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Thanks.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
What's he so excited about?
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
There's not enough room.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
What are you doing!
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
How long is that gonna take?
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
What are you laughing at?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Sleeping.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Don't even say it.
How long has it been?
What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Recover any bodies?
That's the understatement of the year.
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
What do they call you, sweety?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
I'll go. It's my fault.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Turn up this road.
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
I always favored the Hulk.
Aw, fuck.
I guess not.
Over.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Say my name.
French?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
My little French.
Stop. Get away.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Yeah? What?
Well?
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
I've moved on.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
No.
My apologies, madam.
It's okay, Puff.
Very well.
Progress!
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
Three foot one.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Please, honey, let me in.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Done!
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Yes.
Flares?
That's very funny.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
So, how's it going today?
Do you like my new look?
Really?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Extra dessert?
Wait!
Mother?
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
About sixty, seventy bucks.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
How?
We'll be there.
How much?
Okay?
Make it twenty.
Cut.
Thought you only drank milk.
I lost twenty bucks.
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Character.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Whaddya been so far?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
You think I can lose?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
Sign up.
What happened to you anyway?
I been thinking.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
So does Eddie.
Sure.
How do we stand?
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
How're the hands?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I wanna walk.
Tell her what?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Maybe. You want to play?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Quit. He's too good.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
Now and then. Why, do you?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
What's the limit?
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Try me.
Shoot.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
You quittin', friend?
What bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
I used to be an actress.
You don't look like a college girl.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I drink.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
No.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
What time is it?
Why?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.
What did all this stuff cost you?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Oh, cut my finger.
I've got something in my bag.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Haven't you opened it?
You going out?
Give it to me.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Who is it?
You wanna drink?
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
I love you.
You glad?
What is it, Eddie?
For how long?
No, I want to walk.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
Fifty-seven.
Where's Bert?
Why?
Well, what's the matter?
Go on back to the hotel.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
That's what the game's all about.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
You name it.
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
How much do you remember?
With them?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Who is this?
What do you want?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Yes.
What's inside?
Humans.
Who?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
Virginia...?
Need some gas?
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
Bathroom?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
There are more this year than last.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I had an awful dream.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
Where's your car?
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
Do you know how to follow a map?
I don't see anything.
I swear it was here.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
Connie, don't hang up.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Just my luck, no ice.
You still believe in him.
Are you all right?
Did it work?
There's good news and bad news.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
What happened?
That signal. It's a countdown.
Then what?
I'm thinking.
Spunky?
College nickname.
Perfect, she's using it.
You punched the President in the face?
Pops, you're a genius!
What'd I say?
Oh shit, we're late.
What the hell are you doing?
Get us out of here!
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I had a feeling you would.
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
How're we doing?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
What?
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Dick-weed.
Your son.
He's my angel.
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
We're already over Mach 2!
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
Mr. President?
Why did you people come here?
Here... now.
And before here?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
May we go home now, please?
All your life.
Venice, Italy!
That doesn't look much like a library.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Alexandretta. Now we know.
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Marcus!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
That was our assessment as well.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Are you sure?
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
You said go between them!
My room!
This.
The Grail Diary.
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
It is you Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Through the library?
He was actually there? You saw him?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Well, uh...
No! Don't Shoot!
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
This is intolerable!
Stop!
What?
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Dad, how can you?
What does that mean?
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Nice landing.
This is intolerable!
You call this archaeology?
Dad?!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
I like Indiana.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
After you, Junior.
That was seven hundred years ago.
Get that camel out of the way!
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
Why are you trying to kill us?
This is your last chance.
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Come one, what's wrong?
No, the stones are mine!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
I like the service here.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
The old man saw it in a dream.
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
It's pulling me deeper!
Can you move your arm?
It's starting to let go!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Not leftovers?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
Don't catch cold.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
You've got to go to sleep now.
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
I can't!
And they don't even know what it really is.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Give me your hat...
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
Where are you,...Al?
Try me.
Arrrgh!
It wasn't him.
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
Yes.
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
Who are you?
Who am I?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
Yeah.
I'll talk to them.
What do I do?
Outrun them.
I wouldn't say that.
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
I don't know...To get Al.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
What do you mean we.
I did. I brought you back here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Go out, take your first left.
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
Like the guys that attacked us.
What do you mean?
Gone where?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
What about money?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Who cares?
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
Oh yeah, to what?
Now what?
The beach.
Eating sushi?
Holy shit!
What is it?
Swim.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
The sand.
Why not?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!
She's...pretty fast.
You're beautiful..
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
What do I do?
.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
...Joe.
What happened?
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
It worked.
Well you did it today.
Now, where would I be?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
Follow that busboy.
I feel like an idiot.
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
They're all in it.
How do you know?
She's the toughest to read.
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What am I supposed to do?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
What Happened?
She's got the most beautiful...s
You been had. We have.
Bingo.
You found her.
Osaka.
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
Just stay here and rest.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What next!
I can't...
I can't see a thing.
He was with Gruner!
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
You sure this will work?
He hung us up dry.
There's a lot you don't know.
Do something.
What exactly?
Be quiet.
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
You just got a Mickey.
Doesn't matter.
What is your name?
No!
Oh, I can't.
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
What kind of a deal?
It's a long story.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
PEM115!
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
We'll have to let them go.
Who is your friend?
I have a new client.
Al Viola.
That name's familiar.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Your memory.
What about it?
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Right.
How do I look?
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Joe.
What?
Take the card.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
The fresh tuna?..
Yes...What is it?
What's what?
Nothing.
Oh...and who is it!?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
...Blake
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
And you.
...right here too.
Me still. They left you alone?
Why?
As if your mind's not all there.
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
You are.
Promise you what?
Why do you do it?
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
...Naw. Made that up.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Is that Ryuji?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you stay with me?
Why?
Who else is interested in me?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
He didn't.
No.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
You know where he went?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
What is it?
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
Where we going?
Hong Kong.
You've  been there?
I know the territory.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Why not?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
Why did you, then?
How?
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Now what?
He can't help us.
You are, I've seen you.
He told me what to do.
Come on.
Yeah...I have to get away.
What about the others.
Is there anything else?
Wait.
You can't take that.
Why not?
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Right there.
Yes.
The other working.
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
Yeah? What for?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I'll take some.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
I heard them.
Where?
Mom.
Yes, baby?
How long?
Three hours.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Are you all right?
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Maybe later.
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I'm not touching my film...
I'm afraid you are.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That computer has everything...
What about you, you got a crew already?
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hi, baby.
Hello?
Okay.  Lowell?
Is there any more rice...?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Soy sauce...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
What's the difference...
Thank you, Bob.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
"60 Minutes"?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey Wigand...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
Yeah...
...you fucked me!
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
Yeah.
Alright?
Hardly new news.
No shit.
So, is everything okay?
Oh, man.
Lowell!
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
Coffee?
How have you liked your stay?
Did work.
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
The new place? New.
You believe that?
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Good. But Jeff...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You mean... since this morning?
No.
ABC...?
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
What about now?
What are you talking about?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
There is -- there is no family.
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Object to the form of the question!
Object to the form!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Who's the pigeon?
Is that... one person?
You're in a rush.
That's his lawyer.
Triple!
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Objection, your honor!
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
It was a gift from a client.
You're in check.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
I have it.
My God.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
So who'd you hire?
No.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
It sounded like a bell.
These are yours.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
So I hear. Is that all?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
Hello?
Miles?
No. Don't stop.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
She never particularly cared for me.
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
We're damaged goods.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I know.
Good.  Are those foods?
Hi.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
That's blackmail.
Hello?
You have to leave the house immediately!
Please! Leave the house.
Marylin!
Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Hello Marylin.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Sweet.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you need a Tagamet?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
Forgery and Fraud?
He was right, wasn't he?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Miles Massey.
Of Massey Myerson?
Every week --
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Herb wants to see me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
Ha Ha.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Oh brother. Here we go.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Thank you.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
She always looked out for me.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
Wrigley!
I am very sorry.
What are they?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Three is not Farrow.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Oh—Mary—
Yes, sir?
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Mr. Warne?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
South America.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Ellie—
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
No.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Is that his name?
Why? Do you know him? 
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
I'm sorry you read it.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
We've done that already.
What do they say?
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Are you talking to me?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
That's none of your business.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Your ego is colossal.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
What do you mean—starvation?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
To New York?
Yeah.
This isn't "piggy-back."
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Not a one.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
was—but—
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Carrots.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
What're you going to do?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come on! come on! 
Nope.
I love you.
Congratulations.
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
—six—seven—eight—nine—
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Where's the bus to New York?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
But can't you wait until morning—
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
What time is it?
I'm hungry.
The old man's screwy!
Mr. Gordon—
Collect?
Get out of here!
What's the thousand bucks for?
If it's on the level.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
I am, Joe.
You!
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Collect?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Then—you'll have to git !
Yeah.
Zeke.  Git!
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Where do you live?
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Keep saying what?
What's the other name?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Can you get some sworn statements?
I did.
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
I'm sorry.
No.  Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
No.
Who?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Tough day.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
For sexual purposes?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
More than ten years.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
She's the best damn witness we have!
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Do you walk home?
I know. That's why I went.
But then you told her you were home.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'll call her.
Who was there for your ass?
Who?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
I need a favor.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
Great, you're here.
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
My pocketbook.
Take your time.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
You're not tired of it?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
Ordell pick up his bond?
No, you didn't. What branch?
With ten thousand? Nine.
If you're having some.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
This is pretty.
Uh-huh.
'76?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He called you?
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
How do you feel about getting old?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Well, hello.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Who was your girl before Annette?
How old's Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
And is that it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
In the bag underneath.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Set him up.
Tell him you want to see him?
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I didn't use you, Max.
I know.
Where're you going?
Spain.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I'm just tired in general.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Most of the times.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
You know what we want.
You talk to him?
Not yet.
And splittin' with her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
There was a guy with Melanie?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
What about me?
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Sure.
Uh-uh.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Beaumont Livingston?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Jackie?
Yeah, do you like it?
It looks good on you.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Beaumont Livingston.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I understand woman, damn!
I got a problem...
The Cockatoo Inn.
A woman.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
Who?
How do you know she did that?
I was there, I saw her do it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's boring, isn't it?
I can sit through it once.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
Four days ago.
Susanville.
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
Want a Metrix?
Which one?
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
C'mon, don't lie.
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
About five years ago.
Wanna fuck?
Is it dead?
He went to meet that stewardess.
We're leaving now!
Lemme have the bag.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.
Thanks, Baby.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Guess where I am?
You're outside?
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Sure.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
It's Louis.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You couldn't just hit her?
You shot her twice?
Where did you shoot her?
Louis?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
We went to the parking lot.
Where you shot her.
Fuck you for asking me that.
What'd you shoot her with?
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Jesus Christ.
I'm going out for a few hours.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
That's Winston. He works here.
Gonna have to put up cash.
Beaumont Livingston.
Haven't a clue.
Hey, Max.
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Somebody already did.
What?
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
How'd you find me?
All I did was walk out with it.
My office.
She was afraid.
It's the next street.
You sure?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
We're back.
He ain't here right now.
He leave town?
Give me his home number.
What are you then?
What isn't happening?
Dream on!
No, thanks.
I see.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Hello, Sam.
Are you all right?
Daddy!
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
You have an unusual hand.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
It's hard to explain.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
What are you talking about?
I'm hanging up.
Daddy, what was that noise?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Tell your mother.
Wait ... Daddy.
Now what?
How long had that been going on?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
Her knee acting up?
Who?
She hates me, Louis.
I can't relax.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.
Are you in the service?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
I don't know what to say.
What's your name?
What was that?
It's freezing.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
They stole it.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Where is the lamp?
That help?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
What happened to you?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Did you look around the headboard?
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
They're weird names.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
A good lay.
I must have been out of my head.
What?
What do you mean you can see?
She looked good then.
Not to me.
I'm going home.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Why do you bring her up?
When was the last time I said a word?
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Show me Della!
What does it say?
It's gone to the top.
What the hell are you doin'?
He's coming right over.
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Help me! Help me!
I love you, Jez.
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
He said you didn't have one.
It's just me.
Stay away from me, Jez.
It might be for me.
Me neither.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
I love you when you're angry.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You look upset.
Jake, what is it?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Sit down, Jake.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
You come here often?
I can't move.
Just relax.
Well that's good to know.
I no from around here.
How was Palm Springs?
Hot. Where do I sign?
He's burning up.
Push 'em back.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Dream on!
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
Push 'em back.
I'll page him.
Call my chiropractor.
We're doing everything we can.
Where am I?
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
Count 'em on one hand.
Still married, Jake?
Why the hell we drivin' here?
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
What do you mean?
You've seen them?
Oh God. I know. I know.
Died?
A car accident.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Do you want me to get someone?
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
Pour it in.
Yes it does.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
We're not leaving Crutch!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
His mother?
Minimal.
Uh-oh.
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Creepy.
Better let me.
Shit!
The hull's imploding!
We're not supposed to do that.
Done!
We'd need charges.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then what do we do?!
It bought us some time.
Earth II.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
You just keep an eye out.
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Kicker, anything?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Med-kit?
What if you miss?
See? We're not so bad.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Did you like it?
Rizzo, pull away!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
She needs a little time.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
They'll make it.
Now that's just gross.
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
I missed you too.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Leave him behind!
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
Then open the doors!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
You wanna die?
More soldiers?
Guys, please come with me!
What have you done?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Can we get through these?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
My cars. And a comic book.
You got it.
And incidental damages, if any...
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
This is Matt Hooper...
I know who he is...
Who's driving the boat?
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
What's that one, there?
He's trying to sink us!
He's comin' up -- !
Do you see the kids?
Probably out in the back yard.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
I never hear the whistle.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
My kids were on that beach...
What stinks so bad?
How can you tell?
Florida license plate.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Why don't we just tow it in?
I hope we get some more help.
What the hell?
What day is this?
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Think the tide's with us?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
You here for the summer?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream.
We're not even sure what it was.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You wanna call it a night after here?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Leg of lamb this time?
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Look at him take it!
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
I'm okay...
Over there!
20 feet, if it's an inch...
I'll drink to your leg.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
I don't think so.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
You know how I feel about her.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't know...
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Charisma?
Jesus, Bleek.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
I don't like Katrina.
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Hey man.
No... I guess not.
Wow, dream big!
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Viscera?
What do you play?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
No, more commercial stuff.
Like what?
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
That suits you.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Is Vanessa here?
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What are you?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
You should try Adderall.
I heard that was you.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Elbow.
Your name, please?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
You mean like couples?
Or...
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
I am a suicide risk.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
The Penny Saver sucks.
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
No way! She's pretty.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Keith's hot.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
We're actually, finally doing this?
Yeah, downtown.
A hotel?
It's a loft.
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
It's a portfolio of my work.
You took this picture?
That's me.
No it is not!
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
What?
What if they're dangerous?
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
What's your name, boy?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Where you from Walter?
Tight fit.
Who?
That bad?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
If you say so.
You two been busy in here.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
What did he sound like on the phone?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
All set?
Fuck!
What is it?
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Not yet.
Bri'.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Early, just think...
What is it?
What happened?
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Umm. Altogether?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Yes!
Shit.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
What do you want?
You think?
Telly.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Why I give pennies?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
You goin'?
Man we fucked him up.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Right now?
Yeah. Come on.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
No...
Because, you know why. You know.
Do you care about me?
Dance!
What?
Telly is at Steven's?
One.
I tested positive?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
You're OK?
Miss, would I be prying?
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
I know.
Did you bleed?
I didn't bleed.
You didn't?
Passion...
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yeah.
He still does.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
It's me. Telly.
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Slow.
Yeah.
By yourself?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Morpheus.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
What do you want?
You got it on the board.
I'm positive.
Yes you are.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Sorry.
What is it?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
A few people.
What do you mean, stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Peter.
To get your attention.
Where is she?
You know her?
Not really.
Why her?
But you said you didn't know her.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
What word did you leave last night?
Hello, Peter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I know where you are.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Why did he what?
Uh huh.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
That has nothing to do with it.
You ready?
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
What about prints?
You mean, no prints but hers?
How long she been dead?
I'm busy right now.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
It's a good play, but risky.
You're always in the middle of a match.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
Mate in five.
No.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
What are they, please?
When I was very young.
Do you always open quickly?
Well, I think I've had enough.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
You sound like my mother.
I think it's interesting.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
Of course.
Do you?
Of course.
No.
I know it was bad.
No.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
No.  You were talking about chess.
Alright.  What about me?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It was.
I'm not playing a game now.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I'm hungry.
I thought you said the line was busy?
What's wrong?
For emphasis?
What?
But I do.
Because I know what it says.
Frank told me.
You're right.  The killer told me.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
You beat him.
<u>What</u>?
We're almost married.
I lied.
About what?
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
You must move away from the Center.
Will your power outward.
I don't know how.
Take the western passage.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
The new Queen lives.
You have not slept in two days.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
<u>Why</u>?
I'm not sure.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
The spiral begins in the west.
I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!
No! You cannot know that!
They can be saddled.
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Yes.
Even by you?
You too are lonely.
I ache with it.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
You will not, then?
What business?
Once is enough, thank you.
You and I will guard the fire.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
And where do you lead, boy?
To the place where Death lives.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
I'm not hungry.
Not sleepy, either?
Hand over your dinner.
Go. I command you.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Where are you going?
We'll meet you at the inn.
My heart stays here.
Sugarballs?
You do?
Would you desert your friends?
Put me down, you lout!
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
We have plenty of hares.
Oh, my poor stew!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
They'll trample him to death!
He will not!
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
You were attacked in the forest?
The new King.
With an old voice?
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Her name is Death.
Few have survived it.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
She was not as beautiful.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
What's that man's name?
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
OK, I'm fine.
Huh... 500 meters?
Come on, get down!
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Not taken.
Why?
...I'm going to kiss you.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
What shall we do?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
...I don't know.
I don't know... Five minutes.
Don't fear.
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
...Composer.
...And how much is it?
...Who sent you?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
Salute.
Do you recognize him?
Why am I such an authority?
I have to finish first.
You do?
I've seen it before.
You thought I sent them?
Ellen?
What?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Yes.
You're talking to me?
No.
Then why?
Show me.
Walk with me?
I've changed my mind.
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
Your father?
Where?
Maurice?
To where?
Pacifica, California.
From where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Doubts?  About what?
Red flags man.
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
What was that?
Yes.
Where?
I'm walking there Kris.
Walking where?
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You're walking to California?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
What Mr. Parker?
Tom Joad?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I missed you Kris.
Come on Mr. Parker.
Where am I?
You're in pain.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
What's your shoe size?
I really want that watch.
What do you want?
...Noooo.
Orange soda?
Coffee?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Water?
Sarah -- with an H?
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
You what?
Do you want to fuck now?
To death?
You OK out there?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Ben?
What was that all about?
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
I like it here with you.
How much, do you think?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
You have been lonely?
You have been lonely?
Where have you been staying?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Yes? What?
Yuri... are you...
Harvard Law School?
What alibi?
Were you with another man?
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
Get up.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Dewey Newcomb?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Thank you.
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
You're not going up there.
What did you see when you entered the house?
Was she carrying a weapon?
Yes?
I think so...
-- his life?
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
Name?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I'm a bitch.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
What?!
Josh proposed!
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Don't ask.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
She's completely untrustworthy.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Projecting joy is not my job.
You really think I'm attractive?
Hey --
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
Is he the only one?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
What?
I got bangs!
Neither.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
You're beautiful.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
No, silly. I go here.
You go where?
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
Good. Good.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Thank you. Having fun?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
You look -- nice.
Pink ones.
Yes.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Why do you say that?
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
Why so few?
Fire moat... why do that?
My generosity is not so large as that.
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
Not from me, surely...
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Why have you brought me here?
And then?
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Flozen foleva not good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Faerie ring?
It's bluebells!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
What is it?
Damn them!
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
My God!  Look!
Something the matter?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
God's blessing.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Give in to despair and all is lost.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
One more turn...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
What weapon?
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Barely living, from the looks of it.
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
How're these?
Dolt!
These for me?
You promised!
But you did... you did!
A promise is a sacred oath.
What shall we do?
Oh, dear.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
How much longer?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Are you honest?
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Where are you going?
They tricked you.
I don't want it on me.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
Tis not fit for a princess.
I have no wife.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
Lili!  No!
What have I done?
I thought you were dead... I --
No!  I won't let it happen...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
What's the matter?
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
Exceeding fair.
She's dead!
No!
Dead, dead, dead.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
I'd be honored.
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
In every way.
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Praise be to God.
Where?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
How came you by this blade?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
You're with us in battle.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Can you show us the way?
You've been inside?
Are you going to see Sam again?
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
What's that for?
He hasn't called?
What color?
Mom?
I couldn't get it to go down.
You'd better call and cancel.
What are you doing up so early?
Why?  What do you mean?
I'm going to bed.
He must.
He seems lonely.
No.
My keys.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
It's not what I was expecting.
What did you think it would be?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
You should stay.
I don't know.
Where's your dad?
You look better without make-up.
I'll get your back.
Why?
I'm coming in.
I don't want you to!
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
What's the point of this?
Josh said...
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You'd hate him for the trick.
Where are you?!
Floating to Catalina.
He won't leave my room.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
It could have been a squirt gun.
Mr. Stevens?
A violation?
I hate to ask about a window.
I'm good, thanks.
What are you on?
Right...she married...what was he?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe...?
Well, I feel better about this now.
Is Alyssa home?
She didn't really say.
Uh huh.
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Thank you.
This has got to stop!
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
George, this is the third time.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I forgot where I put my keys.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
Why would you be there?
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
Are you totally insane?!
What are you doing?!
I hate turkey.
Why?
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
The gloves on the table are for you.
You can't make me do a thing.
Hi, Alyssa.
How do you become something you're not?
What I'm not.
I know parts of who you are.
I'm telling you now.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
To hide a black eye.
After everything.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
What would you do?
Thanks for telling me.
I need you to do me a favor.
God, you look like crap, George.
Oh.  Sorry.
Lock the door behind you.
Where is he?
What are you doing?
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Where have you been for a week?!
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I want him with me.
Hey, hey!
I don't have a phone.
I drove over and you were gone.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Do you need help?
I smiled at him.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
That was the truth.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
No.  Mostly me.
Peter left me yesterday.
What did he say?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
Does Alyssa know?
You got any weed?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
His father is a man.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Should I?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
The biggest waste of time since television.
I can't go right now.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
I never asked for more.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
No.
You don't look like you.
You got a dog?
What are you doing in my room?
Can you stay for dinner?
The door was open.
What did you say?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
Dad's home, already?
No, nigger.
Nigger.
A night in the hole?
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
And the baby?
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
She always said that if you were on the outside...
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
I've never seen you in here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Don't I know you?
You went to Monroe?
What?
A loan officer?
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
You're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Guess we better get going, huh?
It ain't here.
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What's up, Ray?
What'd you say?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I don't know. Who do you want?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
Crawfords.
It's a pardon from the governor.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
What the hell are you doing?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
What'd you say?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
I can't eat this.
You didn't get ketchup?
So?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
How you doin'?
I'm all right.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
All in, boss!
Move it out.
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Mama?
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Who?
What's your name?
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
You shouldn't have come here.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
That's what I thought!
We could create our own hell there.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Urr... uggg... errr...
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
How come you're not older?
Valerie's crying!
It's not me, moron.
Makin' friends already.
So far, so good. Now what?
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
This is bad, Nicky.
No. This can't be happening.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
Coulda been much worse.
Bus?
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Should we wake him up?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Look who's back from the dead.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
Schnapps...
Come on. One more time.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
So I followed him...
Please. You got to.
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Adrian?
The South.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Sometimes, sure.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Valerie?
Are you dead?
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
We're going to Jersey?
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Do me.
I love you.
Why is that funny?
A black guy?
See something you like, my man?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you send them?
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You missed something special.
What the hell took you so long?
Did you?
Of course.
I'm fine...  See you...
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
What's your name?
Why aren't you in Nursery?
I'm very smart.
What's wrong, Available?
No.  Just no.
You prefer women?
No.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Later.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And now?
Curious.
About what?
Not about that.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm not armed.  Well?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
You could have called me yourself.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Of course.
Why show me?
I'm going to run.
You know something.
About running, dying what?
It's different now. Help me.
Where did you get that?
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
I wish I could help you.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Some people say children need human mothering.
Uh-uh.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Will you take me with you?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I hate outside! I hate it!
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
Of course.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Beloved husband...
Yes...
I'll make the arrangements.
Come with us.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
How long have you been living here?
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
How did you get here?
I have always been here...
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Where are they?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Not yet.
More... many more.
I'm sorry.
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
I don't think so.
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.
You okay, man?
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
No.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
His or ours?
You know what I think?
I was here yesterday.
I want more.
Me, too.
Hello.
It's me...
Pete?
Me, too.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
Have you partied with him?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
Pete... Don't...
Why are ya goin' so early?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You got him.
You all right?
We killed him.
You killed him.
Dick Laurent?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Never saw him before in my life.
Please tell me.
The wife killer?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Where is he now?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
You just gonna let him go?
That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.
What about yesterday?
Do you remember?
We know that.
What is this, Rogoff?
He's not Madison?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
What's your axe?
Something wrong?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
At your house.
Where's Alice?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
What's that?
A videotape.
When you didn't come to the club.
I called, you know.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
Where would you feel safe?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Was there?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Give that a try.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
It'll be ready.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
At your house. Don't you remember?
I missed you.
Yeah?...
Last time I saw you.
You still care about me?
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
I don't know.
I was?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Hey... Sheila.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Sheila... Stop...
Cable from Gainsford.
Two years!?
Fossils.
Fossils, huh?
I'm a paleontologist.
A what?
Found in Asia!
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Okay, brother.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I beg your pardon.
I see.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
It certainly is.
Oh, really?
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
No kidding?
Yeah. You know.
Well, that's that, I guess.
Chalmers Bryant!
Think of it! In times like these.
Nothing. Why?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
And mine's Conway.
Goodness, no!
So there are others?
Oh, yes.
108 and still active?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
No porters here!!
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Oh, immediately.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Are you taking me?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
What is it?
See that spot?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
Did I say "if"?
That's what you said.
George, come back!
Why not? What's going to stop me?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Yes.
The clothes?
Yes, everything!
What was that?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Where did you come from?
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
My name's Sondra.
Was this your idea?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME–
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
The hell happened?
You shot an eight year old girl.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
...touch that.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
And Goodwill Toward Man?
No. just peace on Earth.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
All the time, sir.
Helluva night, isn't it?
We'll take it from here.
What?  Who the hell are you?
It's a bug.
I taught kindergarten.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Something's wrong here.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
And what's this ... ?
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus Christ...
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Do his job.
in case I need it?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
What are you doing?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Noon exactly.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
How's Dee?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
And they're buying it?
Did it leave?
Actually, I don't know...
Wally!
Is it now?
What?
They're inside.
Drop some money.
No.  Follow him.
He'll turn around.
Agatha...
He's here.
Oh, God...
Where are we going?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She died?
She grew up.
-- but he didn't.
Then who was he?
Found?  Where?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
About who?
You don't remember me, do you?
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
Kill type?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
Hence the expression...
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Don't worry, Lamar.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Lara called me.
I go running down there.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
I'm not getting halo'd.
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We can't grab it...
Somewhere near the capital?
The mall?
Yeah?  So?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Confirm with trig and image.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Why did you catch that?
You're certain?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
If it's a question of authority.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Just go to the beginning!
I need help with her.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
She's a precog?
Are you reading my mind right now?
They don't belong to anybody.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I scored a goal!
Come on!
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
Who are you?
Sean, wait...
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Kill me!
Let go of the gun.
You're not gonna kill me...
Something wrong?
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
Not if I stay away from him.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Hold that thought.
What safe place is that?
How do I even know which one has it?
Which one is that?
John?
Oh, God, what did you do?
We know why John was tagged.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Congratulations, sir.
Good God.  What was that?
It's the same prevision.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Can't they shut that off?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
There a maid in this hotel?
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
He looks familiar.
Raincheck?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
We used to, every summer.
I don't have any sugar either.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
Since right after we lost our son.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
They've never been separated before.
You're Bobby, right?
You sure? I just made it.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Is it a good room?
Are you sure?
Yeah. Take it.
So?
Is it the good room?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
It's on West Broadway.
We're in Fashion.
Is he cute?
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's alright.
Oh no. What is it this time.
We used to take baths together.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
She's, uh, sleeping.
What's wrong, baby?
Hello.
Chloe?
I don't know.
Mommy's not home?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
I feel weird asking him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Yeah? You sure?
I'll support you.
I never promised you anything.
Take her.
Whu --
There's no touching.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
No.
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
That it?
This is it.
You like the ponies?
Sure. Yeah.
You bet the ponies?
Pshhh...
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I'll work it off.
I didn't say that.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Yes.
What is it?
There won't be a next thing.
What's the plan?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
You don't know where you're going?
No. Just the cross streets.
Spa?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Understand me?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
We're with Ruiz.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
Any time, bro.
What about boxing?
So, it was a draw.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
How am I being shitty?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I thought you hate that club.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Fuck them.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
I think we might.
You wanna go right now?
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
I like it.
It's not even yours.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
What? Did she say something?
Who's driving her?
Right here's fine.
Is that the woman from..?
What's the movie?
I'll get the girl.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Who you calling?
How much was it?
Forty-six.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Yeah, I guess.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They didn't say an address?
Nothing else.
They asked who it was.
This is bullshit, man.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What the fuck is that supposed --
I mean, that's what I heard --
What did I 'get?'
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
He woulda told us right?
Yeah.
You happy?
Back in.
You fucking nuts?
What the hell did you do?
What the fuck was that about?
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Put that shit out...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
The what?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We need guns.
We don't need guns.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
So what do we do?
Let's just go now and wait.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
Tom. How's it going?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Bobby and Ricky.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Where's the surprise?
You want your surprise?
You want to come splash around.
I want to leave right now.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant?
What's up, man.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
How much is what?
Where do you live?
Excuse me.
You strapped?
Why? What I say bad?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Ow, shit...
And where is...?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
No shit?
Does anyone want another?
What do you want?
No, really, mate?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Ricky.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You know my pager number?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
Sure. You boys want anything?
Thanks.
We're going to New York?
That money is your per diem.
Keys.
I get it.
Don't worry. I get it.
So tell me how it is.
But, Max --
We're square.
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
Yeah.
What they call you?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Bet you like that shit.
Man's rep travels.
Is your papa West Indian?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Yes, sir.
When?
How's it feel?
It hit?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Daddy, where's my money?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You never had it.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You know it.
I'll give you back the 600.
I'm wearing, Archie.
Let Billie finish.
Take it easy, baby.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
What did you give it to me for then?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Okay, okay.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Tell Him that.
Is the program ready?
What?
Let's talk about you for a change.
Why do you ask?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I'm in Detroit.
Did you hear what I said?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Yes. Did you eat?
It won't be easy.
Just hold me.
It will be rough.
Hush your mouth.
I'll be away a lot.
Because you're in trouble.
Talk about what?
I'm tired of praying.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Let some of us come down there.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
Is my family here yet?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Did you see the papers today?
Sure, man.
What?
"His greatest greatness."
I say a lot of things.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I better not come in.
I ain't stupid.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Did you hear me?!
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
You're my father.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You the man.
You evil this morning.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Who the hell are they?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
Yes sir.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
Where do I find you?
Deal.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Daniel.]
[What is his name?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Where do I find him?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[How much do you want?]
[What do you mean?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Yes.
What is it?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
Is it loaded?
And what if amateurs try it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
So what's wrong?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
What are you doing here?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
No.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
No.
Not at all?
No.
And don't start crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Do you think he'll come back?
How do you think he got out?
Well, I let him go.
It's better to be free, right?
It hurts.
Where?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
I don't understand.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Did you used to?
You're late.
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
Could I ask you a question?
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Rosanna Guerrero.
It's Creasy.
Last night. Do you know something?
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
You should be sleeping, baby.
I like him, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
I think it's nice he's American.
She likes him.
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
Two tourists who never went home.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
Hey, Herbie...
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
What makes you say that?
Yeah, sure.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I feel fine.
I don't think I remember him.
It's her baby too, you know.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Who?
Marty.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
No...
Please...
No...
Please...
You got an elevator in this house?
We just live one flight up.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Are you kidding?
I'm just here with another girl.
I'll see you around.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
That's the one.
What time is it?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
You talked to Walt?
Yes, O'Reilly?
That's right.
Where?
Hospital.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
When will he be able to write?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
We could steal one of the choppers.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We're a good team.
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Wait a second...
But what about Major Houlihan?
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Is he out?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
I don't feel anything.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
I think we could still have a chance.
See you.
It's possible
Very happily married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
I didn't have much choice.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Thanks.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
No, never in the slightest.
In the direction you want to go.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
You can cut the bow.
I have not understood what you means.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
What's going on? Who started this?
You mean who hit who?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Good morning, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Nice.
Are you all right?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Against anything. Just protest.
Hello, John.
Me?
Can I help you pack?
Ted Sheldon.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
A third party?
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
The Websters.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Wait a minute . . .
What's that?
The letter.
In what man!
John Doe.
John Doe.
Well, you're catching on.
Plus a bonus.
Hurry up, Pop.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Help yourself.
Who's got him?
The heelots!
How could he be a fake? 
A what?
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Join the John Doe Club.
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
What difference does that make?
Did you write it—or didn't you?
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
They're not usually graduate students.
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
What happened, Mike.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Am I gettin' the car?
Manual or automatic?
Automatic.
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
That's right.
Is that all?
It's all there.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
It rarely has to be done.
I know.
Recruited you from where?
You'd never been out of New York?
How did you like Toronto?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
I think I can handle that one.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
I'm not good at lying.
Get good at it.
Yes.
Why?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
The 6 horse is last.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run last?
The 6 horse is still last.
The jockey!
We won!
How long you been coming here?
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
You're crazy.
And what if you can't live with it?
So what do you want to do?
Have you evacuated anyone?
Only that floor.
I worship you.
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
What do you want from me?
You think I didn't need you?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
What do you think?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
When?
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Scottie...
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
Hmm?
...the hell are you talking about?
You crazy? With all those people around?
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
What do you think would be in order?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
Who's running it?
Roper...
What have you promised them?
Are these yours?
Yeah, they are but...
God-Damn you!
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
It's okay.
Why?
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
You were right.
Who are you?!
It's all here...
Wake up?!
No.
Not my problem.
Divinity?
You are not a God.
The new world.
It's not real.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
It's his nature.
How long 'till we can eject?
How long?
What?
What's her name?
The woman you're stuck on.
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
One condition.
What?
Why?
The truth.
Then you had her killed.
Why would I do that?
Then where is she?
An interface attendant.
Where?
Insurance.
Cleaning up a mess.
-- You told me.
-- The inside?
But I don't know anything about programming.
It was a test.
Realize?
I wasn't with you.
But you were with me.
Not you.  A copy.
I'm sorry.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
What's so funny?
Just like that?
Voice activate.
Activated.
Resurrection.
Standard, modern, upscale --
-- Standard.
Program name?
Connect to public access.
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Is this... food!
Release the power WITH the power.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
PTERODACTYL!
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
NEW POWER COINS!!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
Let's go after him!!
I'm in!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
It's... an eagle?
Look closer.
Just shut your gap!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
Simon says...
Anybody see them?
How the heck?!...
THREE SECONDS!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
We're asking you to go to prison.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
The goddamned bastards.
Poor, yeah.
Boo-Boo.
I had everything. Once.
So what happened?
And now you have everything.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
We could lose the deal!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Who hired the bastard?
You ain't even a man yet.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Inside, they were talking of you.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
I'm already late.
I was calling yesterday.
Same here.
It's a mask.
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm doin' business here!
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
You bastards, I said twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
Who?
Come off it, Bugs.
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
I like that.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
This business is about taking risks.
He's trying to make it.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You gotta plan these things.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I found that out.
They do what I tell 'em.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Forget it.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
What a cozy little scene.
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
That a Jew compliment?
You're fuckin' crazy.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Switch hands.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Uhh - martini?
Olive or eyeball?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Bitchin' good cake.
You're acting kind of...odd.
What are you watching?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
What's the "bad" part?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I don't think so.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
Stu...LOOK!
What?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
We like to think so, yeah.
Who told you we deal drugs?
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
... What are they all doing there?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
I'm good.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
What pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Behind the books.
He seemed quite taken with you.
I don't want to talk about it.
Who is it?
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
So, you come here all by yourself?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I did not--
Looks like it, but--
But it *isn't*?
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
You got worms.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
What do I play?
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Yeah. What about the second act?
What dame?
Paine.
Why do I always laugh at that?
Drunks are funny--
Yeah. Funny--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Again? Good idea.
Diz--
How about getting married?
Any time.
Okay. You don't mind?
Have *you*?
We're gonna get married.
My first name's--Clarissa.
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
You know, we're getting married.
The war's on!
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Taylor, my dear.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
How do you feel, champ?
One minute! Just one minute!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
I did. What about it?
Than what?
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
The porter's got them. They're coming.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Look! There it is!
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield?
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Well--goodnight.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
Please, sir!--come with me!
Oh, now--
Jefferson--
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
What is it?
What's your name?
There *what* was?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Go ahead--punch.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Oh, just a day--
A *day*!
Committee, huh?
Committee.
Yes, I see that.
Good. Where are we?
What's that?
What?
Thanks very much.
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
You mean--here?
Have you always had to--work?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
It *is* not!
Abigail.
No!
Letitia.
Lena.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Must have been tickled pink.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Thanks a lot.
Hello.
Yay!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Oh--you are!
Then you *did* say it.
I'm splendid, too.
That's--that's splendid.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Let's get away from here. 
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Yeah?  And what else?
Why don't you do it yourself?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
Deeds?
Since he was born.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Most every day.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
Sometimes he whistles.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Any children?
Thank you very much.
No. Are you?
I haven't.
Yes!
Are they true!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I—
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
What's that got to do with it?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
Sure. I met you.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What are they going to do?
Yes.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
He played in the town band, too.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Let's just walk, okay?
Well, here we are again.
Hello, Mary?
I'm crucifying him.
Yeah, then what?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
With pay!  She is out the door.
What's bothering you, huh?
What're you going to do?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
Come on, come on!
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
You try it.
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Me sir?
How is this, sir?
You can't come up here!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Miss Bennett please!
It's a lie!
But your honor—
I can't find him.
Look!
What?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
How do you do.
Are your parents living?
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Will you have a cigar?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
That's funny. Why is that?
What're you talking about?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur wants to quit!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
What do you think bodyguards are for?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Me?!
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Your Honor—
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Who are they?
What is your name?
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
What do you think you're doing?
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Shall I call the police, sir?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Were you supposed to have a session?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
Ernest, what do you think?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
What?
Why? I'm paying for this.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
Where's your wife, Henry?
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
It's a thought I had.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
Althea hasn't told you?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You do?
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
You like me. How come?
Where am I supposed to eat?
...so rich?
Doc...
Lily.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
What's happening here?
We're going for a walk.
Ph.D., psychologist.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Finally, some common sense...
No, I really don't.
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
I'm not making any promises.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is she against you getting help?
I've offended you!
Is this the treatment?
Sore throat?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
You like it?
That's what I like.
Which thing?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
What was that?
Transference!
Hello?
I guess you saw the show...?
...How violated I feel?
I am irate!
Anything... just ask.
You got off easy.
Will you wait for me?
We're only talking about six weeks.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What?
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Slash what?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
How's it coming?
Really?
Who else knows?
Damn! What is your name?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
I can tell you anything else.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
"Get to know your therapist."
You were messed up, man.
At least you pulled yourself out...
Things got a lot worse.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
No... no training.
Psych major?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Sorry...
I guess that makes sense.
You know where he's taking her?
I never killed a priest before.
Oh yes, of course.
Now go find me a big stick.
None of the above, thank you.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
Where's your new friend?
Yeah?
Intestines.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
You lie.
Fifty percent.
A bright good morning to all.
No.
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
I just decked your brother
Yeah, I was there.
You swear?
Every damn day.
What did you find? What did you see?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
You know your history.
We're almost there.
That "thing" gets me excited.
What are those mirrors for?
Preparation for what?
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
No you're not.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Why would I do that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
I'm staying.
Have you no respect for the dead?
I was mistaken.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
I found it, Evy! I found it
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Hey,... don't I know you?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
That thing gives me the creeps.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
I know you did.
I knew you'd know.
Except for one little thing.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
So who killed him?
We didn't think this through very well.
When was that?
Much less go outside.
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Who are you?
How about... the Savage Six?
Sounds good to me.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
What did he mean?
Hey... you okay?
Yes!
Yes!
How's your dad?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
He'll never make it.
I got it.
Should I kill them?
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're dead.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Just a waitress.
Sure -- I guess.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Who's the artist?
Curiosity.
You're a spy.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Or talk?
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Date?
Sure.
I admire you.
It's home.
I just want to be a superhero.
It's me.
I'm going inside.
What?
Bye. 
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
You're the Sphinx.
My heart died a long time ago.
We had an off night, that's all.
So what else has Superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
But she still might call!
I'll drive.
Cover me!
I can't.
So you're chicken?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Let's go.
So where's the art?
What's that?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
We're superheroes.
Are you famous?
So what can I get you?
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
Mother... it's not what you think!
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
She likes you.
Definitely.
This is bad.
Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Sorry.
Be a Mohican.
And there's the Sphinx.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
Through there!
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
You realize what is at stake?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Who is there?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Bastia -- and you?
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
The first reports came in at about ten.
How did it spread so quickly?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Good evening, sir.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
No...
Well, you shall see.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
No.
Were they pretty?
One had better legs.
Promise me you will never leave me.
All right -- I promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Open the door.  It's me.
I know what you're doing in there.
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
Who is it?
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
I wrote it.
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
What was there to tell?
My God, what do you think?
Do you know what you're saying?
God help me -- yes.
I know.
Can you give me a drink, please?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Is he alone?
Yes, sir.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
And I can go free?
I know you smoke weed, right?
Why you say that?
I don't know!
No.  Thought he was with you.
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
What's crackin'?
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
Just a little.
I can't taste nothing.
Who is that?
I walked.
You know what this is?
What's the matter?
It works.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
What we gonna do?
You see that?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Naw, you go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Wait.
You're welcome, Unc.
I will.  When can I come visit?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Most definitely.
Here I come!
I do.
All damn.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You see that?
You too.
Nice to meet you?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Roach, what are you doing?
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where's Craig?
You wanna knock?
What?!  What that mean?
Get 'em, Craig!
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Ah damn.  Damn.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Where's Craig?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Where did Craig move to?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
Debo!  Debo!
I can't feel my legs no more.
Hey, what's going on?
Take your car.
'Take your car?'
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Elroy, what happen?
I threw my back, again.
What's he doing here?
Don't remind me.
What happened here?
All right, I'll do it.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Where'd you come from?
Somebody close?
I...
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
That's right.
You shot her?
No.
Good luck.
Come with us, sir.
You're out of your mind.
I will do no such thing.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
How should I...?
I killed you.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
How am I supposed to get away?
Again.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
I want'to talk to her.
Is that something precious?
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
All right. Kisses to you.
No...kisses to you.
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
You remember me?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
Keep the change.
Well?
Thanks for the shine.
Fuckin' A.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Gimme a dollar.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
That one.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Where?
Only you.
Yeah.
Come Back.
Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Any trouble?
What do you figure he done with it?
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Here they come.
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
O, she's all right.
How's your sister Pearl?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
Where's Ruby?
AAA-MENN!
You have all sinned!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Bluebeard!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You go set down by the River.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Satan.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
You swore, Pearl!
Where's Mom?
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Dead.
Where ye from?
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
What are you doing, boy?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Don't you believe me?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
O no! Your turn!
All right.
No.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
What's their names?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
Harry!
Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
Are you through praying?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Them kids is yours?
My flesh and blood!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
What are you after them for?
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
What'd you all talk about?
Pearl and John.
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Guess I did.
Haven't slept, have you?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
Hello?
Who?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
How you doing, pal?
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
She lived there.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Krueger.
It wasn't that serious...
Right home after.
I won't.
Get into bed.
You okay?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Screw sleep!
All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
I never touched her.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Nice to have a fire.
You feel better now, right?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Good evening, Anna.
What are you serving?
You should be more careful, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
I have nothing to hide.
Well, a hat...
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
You want this?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
No, that's not him...
Or it might be the firing squad!
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Misha! Misha!
That must be the one!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
The Duchess...
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good evening, Gaston.
What time have you, Gaston?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Your Highness...
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
Leon, my little boy.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
We don't want to be disturbed.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrade.
How much does this cost?
Two thousand francs.
A week?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Bad news?
That's even better.
Yes, monsieur.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
Allow me, Comrade.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Business.
What business?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
You, please.
How long do we have to wait here?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
No.
Can I help you?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Suppress it.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
That's a strange angle.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Ni-notchka.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Do you hear that?
Was that talkative?
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
As a representative of Moscow...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
I don't like your following me.
I didn't follow you.
Then how did you get here?
I always eat here.
What are you after?
What?
Will you smile?
Why?
Just smile.
Because we are an odd couple.
Do you like Scotch stories?
Not funny, huh?
You see? Life can be so simple.
How do you do?
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Yes... a little white house.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Much happier.
Let's turn on the radio.
No music.
Hello, Leon!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Yes, Swana.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Has done what?
Hello, Leon darling!
Good morning.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Here, please...
Well... that's my business, madame.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
May I ask why?
Cigarette?
Where to, madame?
Where do you eat?
At Père Mathieu's.
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Executive clemency ...
We could get that.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I'll bet he would.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
You do it.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
It's a code or something.
And?
He wants money.
We can't touch Hoover --
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Sorry ...
May I say something, Mr. President?
Who?
Sir, the deadline is today.
The army?
Lincoln used it.
That was civil war.
I know it well, sir.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
I believe you're right, boss.
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
More light, chief?
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I can't ...
Mom expects great things from you ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
What?
Mr. Castro.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Why, you got a customer?
The White House.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
She's quite pretty.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
He was a politician.
Yes.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
It broke my heart when Harold died.
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Hi.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
We got the press this time!
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
POWs.  And their families.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?
Sir?
Of them.
Yes, yes.
We lost ...
I know ...
Amen to that.
It's over, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
I'll do it.  No more.
Are you serious?
Is that the truth?
Dick, you should call Bobby.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Were you planning to tell me?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
This.  Above all.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
I've missed you.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Yes!
Yes.
When?
You.  What' you're doing --
And what am I doing?
Won or lost?
Lost.
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How'd you know I was here.
You heard it?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
Want a cup?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
How come're you doin that?
When did he die?
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Most don't.
You're discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
He's real all right.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
You ain't heard from him?
No I ain't.
Nothin'?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Carla Jean...
...You ride Winston.
Llewelyn Moss?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
But you don't believe it.
No. Probably I don't.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
Believe you're right.
Probably must be.
So when was he here?
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Wasn't no bullet?
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I always am.
Don't get hurt.
I never do.
Don't hurt no one.
What do you think.
...How'd you sleep?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I got it Mama.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
You gave your word?
Not like that. Not like you say.
What's in the satchel?
It's full a money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
Llewelyn!
What'd you give for that thing?
Big talk.
Llewelyn.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' out.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Promise?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn?
What should I do?
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
Why would I let you do that?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know something better.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Where does he work?
I can't say.
Hello?
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
...You getting anything on this?
What airport would you use.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Who is this.
...You need to talk to me.
Why would I care where you're going.
...I know where you are.
You know she won't be there.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...Me?
Yes.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
How much?
Sixty-nine cent.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
What time do you close?
Well... I need to close now --
Call it.
Call it?
Yes.
For what?
Everything.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Tent poles.
You already have the tent?
What kind of tent?
One room, one night.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
...I'm wondering...
I'm sorry.
The what?
No, one forty-two.
Half.
What else then?
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
Took me about three hours.
I been immobile.
...What do you do?
I'm retired.
What did you do?
I'm a welder.
Cast iron?
I didn't say braze.
Pot metal?
What did I say?
Yeah. I was in Nam.
Why would he go to Odessa?
The heroin. You don't have it.
No I don't have it.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Are you in the service?
Yes sir. Two tours.
...I meant your food.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
We think we know where Betty is.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
I know that...
What about it?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Great. Good. Content...
They're fine... you miss it?
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
What?
The LeSabre!
Yeah, me too.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Are you and Larry happy?
All the time...
Oh, you mean Fred.
Lyla's very nice.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
I have... did it sound that bad?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
...well, then you ain't got much.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Make sure it's elevated...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Roy! What are you doing here?
Where you headed, Betty?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
How did you know?
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Like Rome?
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
She called you 'George,' George.
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
You don't sound like you're from here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
How many men have I talked to?
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Who?
Doctor David Ravell.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Were you with him this whole time?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Are you sure I can borrow this?
You should have a little faith in people.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
The fuck you talking about?
Really. And where was that, old man?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
He told us it's in the Buick.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Should I kill him now?
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Joyce was screwing Del.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Half.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
How'd they describe her?
Where? Where is she?
I'm not telling.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
This is Betty at twelve.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
...and how long did she work here?
Seems like a nice place.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Better.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
You lie, motherfucker...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Her show?
Yeah?
Mr. Campbell?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Four hundred, Delmar.
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Pete have a brother?
'N turned into a frog -
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
What's his name again?
Them straw polls is ugly.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Latch right on to that tit.
Devil his due.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Vernon Waldrip.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Uh-huh.
Yes, but honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Who was fixing to betray us!
A million dollars.
It was a moment a weakness!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Who's the honcho around here?
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
You, Zack?
Come back here, kid!
What for?
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Who gave you this idea?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Good morning, girls.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I want to fly jets, sir!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I know.
Hi, son.
What did you call me, boy?
I called you Sarge.
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Yes, sir!
Louder!
Is your brother a flyer?
Vietnam?
You're sure it's okay?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Everything was different.
You serious about having him over?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Not me.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
That was great.
Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Are those for me?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
You okay?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
Remember that.
This is ridiculous...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I can't just...
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Are you okay?
She's gonna handle it.
That's your problem.
The walls are steel, right?
Not that one.
Fuck.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Open it.
Cell phone.
And we're never getting in.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Everything okay?
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
We'd like to come in.
That's highly inappropriate.
Watch your mouth.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Nobody leaves.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
No, Edgar Allen.
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
478...
Fuck him.
Don't.
What's going on?!
He's going down.
That room!
What?!
Can't hear a thing.
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
"What we want is in that room."
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What am I, a five year old?
I don't know, why?
YOU HAVE TO!
What, what, what is it?!
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
What are you doing?
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
He --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
Not an option.
Alma I told you to...
What are you doing with the gun?
Well... is it loaded?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Get out of the car.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Man, fuck you!!!
Motherfucker... you stay away...
I don't know. Look around man.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
We need money first...
So talk...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
We'll all get out of here together.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You don't look alright.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
No.
When?
Congratulations.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
I know that.
Do you?
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
You're surrendering.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Colonel will do.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
That is a separate issue.
Prisoner exchange.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Did your father teach you humility?
How old are you?
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
These four wagons must be his.
You learned her lessons better than I.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
A long time ago...
That's five, keep going...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
One of yours?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Who's in command?
I am, I think.
Goodbye, Francis.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
How far away?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Thank you.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Remember Braddock?
That bad?
Not yet, Thomas.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Bite?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Yes.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yes.
Because you promised.
I'm not tired!
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
You need a glass?
Allman Brothers.
Not yet...how much further is it?
Going to tell Ellie?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Almost there, Louis.
You keep saying that.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Can I have another one?
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
It's Ellie's cat.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Leave me alone!
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
The situation has changed.
There's ... another exit?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Then why aren't you eating?
I can't breathe.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I'm glad we got here in time.
If I had known --
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
You?!
You're in league with Barbossa!
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
To freedom.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Blast it, I'm already awake!
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
What's your name?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
We had time to get to know each other.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You cheated.
Move away.
No.
Why ask me?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Depends.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen it?
You haven't seen it.
... No.
I think he's telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
He's still breathing.
Commodore --
A moment.
But --
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
What are you going to do to him?
I know what you're doing.
Like rotting meat.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Why are there two ottomans?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
It will be an ascension.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Where did he go?
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
You don't want this.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
You were never invited to my house.
Is that what Argon told you?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
You're afraid of him.
What's it smell like?
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Sir, please try to hold still.
Been out for six months now.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
The big house?
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
... just like the mouse.
What happened to it?
That was an egg?
Three days ago it was.
Look at this!
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Just like old times.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
The nanobot... it's not here...
What did you want my hair for?
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
Where is it?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
You're not going after Argon!
I remember I was trying to help...
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
That's impossible.
And you have him?
I could have you fired right now.
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Indeed? How interesting.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
May I use your telephone?
Certainly. Right over there.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will you step into the library?
Of course I am Stewart.
I'm not going!
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
That's an excellent idea.
Ah-ah-ah!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
You're the Tribune man?
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Is that so?
Yale '21, I believe.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Oh, is that so?
Impossible. Put it on again.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Gloria Golden?
Well - it's only April.
Not on my own beat, no.
Well, when are you quitting?
Is that so?
What play?
Araby?
Sure.
I'm not quitting!
No?
You're my what?
All right, outside!
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
That's a lovely dress.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
—and that—
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Staring at us?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Been where?
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Did who?
Hey, Gallagher!
Who was that?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
Hello, Smith.
Surely, come right in.
I don't eat waffles.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Smythe, you've been drinking.
With pleasure, Madame!
Stop calling me Mother!
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Yes, sir.
You try it.
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Found no skeletons?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Mary Sue?
What?
It doesn't matter.
... Sex.
Yes.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Does it look okay?
Looks just like it did.
And they won't be able to tell?
Thank you.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Thanks ... I love you.
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
Having kind of a tough time.
Bud?
What?
She's crying.
I've got to go ...
What is that?
You can't go out there.
But I really should get home.
Sure you are.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
Where are you gonna go?
Really Biff? The keenest?
... Lover's Lane.
Sure is pretty.
It is?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
I don't believe it.
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
Oh, no thanks ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Rain.
Did you do this?
It's like the basketball team.
You're not allowed to lie.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
It's not in ME.
Oh sure it is.
And where's that?
Hello Bud.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Mr. Simpson ...
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Lemme see that.
Get lost!
Oh my God.
What did you do?
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
You know him?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
What were you doing in a library?
It's in your closet.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
So what's the point?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
You have no right to do this.
Well if I don't who will?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Me too. Sounds swell.
It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. I baked them for you.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Hi.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
What?
What's going on?
Rain.
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Where are they?
I like calling you David.
Scout?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
... Like Prince Charming.
McIntire's.
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
I can't.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Oh--well ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
No you're not.
Just gimme the damn remote!
How long do you think you've been here?
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
... What's that?
Oh, hi.
Aren't you a little early?
It's an art book.
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
TV repair.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Hey.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
Cool.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Yeah but what are you doing?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
...yes I'm still on hold...
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
So you're coming tonight, right?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
No.
You look nervous.
Yeah I can't.
It's not cool?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What's all this pudding?
It's not mine.
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
I....please don't do this.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Hello, this is Back.
Yes.
This is Georgia.
Where are you?
...just talking to you....
...yes...
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
Not very late.
Me?
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
So you think you can?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I don't have a girlfriend --
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
They're not open yet?
I don't know.
Do you know them.
Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
This is funny.
Ok.
Alright?
....Hi.....
Who is it?
About six months.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Yeah.
You see?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
What happened?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
You don't think you'll go --
This is Barry.
This is Lena.
Really?
That was good.
I don't freak out very often.
...I don't know what you mean....
Have a good trip.
Hello?
Lena?
Yeah?
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah......yeah.....
This is funny.
Yeah.
For what?
I think maybe over a hundred.
Are you ok?
I'm fine are you ok?
What is this?
I'm sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Ok.
Ok, bye, bye.
No.
Well who did?
I don't know.
I cut myself.
How?
I didn't do that.
Why? ...what?
Your hand is bleeding.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Please don't do this to me.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your Social Security number.
No one will know your name.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
You want her to call you Jack?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
That's that.
How you doin' Barry?
Hi Walter.
What's up?
Fine, thank you.
It takes time to process --
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You ok?
Yes I'm fine.
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Good morning, Barry....
So what should I do with the pudding?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah.
....now: this pudding?
Hey.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
What is this, man?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
This is Barry.
What are you doing?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Yes I am.
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I won't.
I'm serious.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
Seriously.
I know.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
That's cool.
When can you leave?
Your expenses are your own.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Ok.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
He did seem a little strange.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
At your service, Count.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Madeleine --
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
I must grant him his last rites.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
I have a proposition.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Good day, Marquis.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
It's no secret that you loved her.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- that was lust --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I know, because I felt it myself --
Was it impotence?
Abbe de Coulmier!
Of course.
His wife's influence.
Oh. That.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
And my own.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it awfully violent?
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
It's tainted money, Doctor.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Oh, but I am!
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Leave at once --
But it's just begun --
Doesn't that please you?
You're just scared.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I can't
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Louis
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
Why is that, Louis?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
How much?
It's not really--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You will not walk out on me
Yes?
Thank you for your time
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
You drink at 10 am, do you?
No -- no -- I mean--
Hearst?
Can I talk to Hearst?
Forget it-
What are movies about?
Telling stories.
Nope.
Like a bug.
Who the hell's Manolete?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
I expected more from you.
Listen to me-
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Why her?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Craig is one syllable
I'm sorry.
Did I ever tell you about my father?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Shit
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
To do what?
That's for me to decide.
Yes
CITIZEN KANE
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
I think you better sit down
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
Orson, you wanna take five?
We done?
Oh, no--
Yes!
He's Christ?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
Where you going at this hour?
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
What's wrong?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Sure. What is it?
Hit me in the face.
You want me to do what?
You heard me, I said hit me.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Jack! Enough!
Who's that?
You wasn't with her?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Do you see her yet?
You want the title shot?
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Screw you, Jack.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
No, I just told you what happened.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
But you said "you."
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
I can't find my ball.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
I like the gym smell.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
What?
You asleep?
Yeah.
Huh?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
Where you been all day?
I took the kids to my sister's.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Jake --
No, not that.
Then what?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Are you drunk?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Don't make no difference no more.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
How's the weight? Ok?
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
This is the baby sitter.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
His wife took a trip.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
Did you ever own a saw?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Jefferies.
Congratulations, Jeff.
For getting rid of that cast.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Hello.
It's me.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
That's normal.
I don't want to.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Police?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
I wonder.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
How much do you think you'll need?
Hello.
Mrs. Doyle?
It is something really important, Jeff?
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
And you love life?
Not too active.
Anything else bothering you?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Yes.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
You mean "goodnight."
Don't you ever have any problems?
I have one now.
So do I.
What do you think?
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
What's the apartment house number?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
What doesn't?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Is he cleaning house?
Wasn't that close?
Your name?
L. B. Jefferies.
Chelsea 2-5598.
What's that?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
You know something?
Meaning me?
What?
Where can we meet?
Just him.
Buzz Gundersen.
Sure.  It's fine.
I like you, you know?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
What time is it?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Hold it, Jim.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
And you dropped it?
Yeah!  Shh!
You awake?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Will you let him tell it!
Will you wait a minute?
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
He's just loaded, honey.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
He's home.  I heard the car.
Are you going down there?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Come back tomorrow.
Hi.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
Boy!
What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
I just don't want trouble.
I'm here.
Who knows.  Plato?
How'd you get here?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
Jim!
Who's that!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Judy.
Hey where'd you go?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Man, you're schizoid!
Isn't he schizoid?
I came here before.
Can I keep it?
They like you.  Okay?
Who's that?
I shot at one of them.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
I'm sorry.
'Bye, Mom.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What's that got to do with it?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Leave me alone.
He called me chicken.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
Pretty mixed up?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Hi.  I saw you before.
Now that's true!
Who lives?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
Where's Dawson High School?
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
A what?
Goodbye!  See you!
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
You still pretty upset?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I'm getting that way, too.
Why did you do that?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
I don't know.
Hi.
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
We have to go back!
Yes.  My best friend.
Hi, Plato!
What?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
Good evening.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, let him go --
Read a lot about you, Nick.
What are you doing here?!
A man of some travels.
Is this him!?
He wants the money.
To all those cons...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Negative five?
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Do that again.
What.
Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
You forget where I work?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'll see what I can do.
Nick, no --
Nick, I love you --
Get the hell off of me!
He'll kill you.
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
You're in on this.
Gabriel!
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
They've never done a robbery?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
That guy knows you?
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Don't say my name...
They'll have guns.
I don't know...
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
They all are. Football's on.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
I saved your life.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
But I never said Rudy.
You said it a million times!
No, you can't --
You're not Nick Mason...
I shared his cell!
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Where's she work?
Be more specific.
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
The hell you don't.
I did.
We walked the place for a week.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
You got one hour.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
You gotta be kidding me.
Get in the CAR!
...so where is he?
Where is he?! Where is he?!
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Monsters in the gelatin...
Haven't thought about it.
Ain't there yet.
Three days, man.
I'm just talking.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Just a roach, Zook.
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell Ashley... I...
YOU TELL HER!
...for Christmas...
I... sorry, Mister...
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
But... I had a five...
Switch seats with me.
There is no other table --
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Alone at last.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
You ain't dying, he is.
I'll call somebody.
Where was she from, Compton?
The motherfucker killed Vic.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Who, Mr. White?
Did the two of you talk?
Yeah.
What about?
The Brewers.
Sure.
Who's your parole officer?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
What's the cut, poppa?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
I know.
Your name's Freddy something.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Follow you where?
Why?
For what, the cops?
I'm okay.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't believe in it.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Want a smoke?
That's not correct.
Uh-uh, just cops.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
How can you be so sure?
I got 'em, all right?
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
He ain't dead.
So what is it?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Not these guys.
This must have been in the family a long time.
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
As far as -- Sonora?
And this is Helen Carter.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
They're stragglin'.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Hold on.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
Maybe it's better that way.
Tell me, darling.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Which ranch?
How does she draw?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Where'd they go?
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You know what she asked me?
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
How's that?
Kind of sore.
All right, you didn't know.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I said I didn't care.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
What's the matter -- restless?
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
And we're running out of that.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
He certainly could. About a month.
Everybody knows --
Clay Phillips.
Where is he?
How far up the trail?
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
What are you doin' --
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Good night, Miss Wells.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
That's the end of the line.
And that's tough, isn't it?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
No.
You were supposed to be reading words.
She was only teasin'.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight.
I think he wants me.
No, I won't let you do it.
Hey, Brenda.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Hello Brenda.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
No, stay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Ray, run faster.
No. I never date outside my race.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hi Buddy.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
It looks like the furnace.
He's here.
Can you feel that?
Feel that?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
I know, but I've been thinking --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Look, what I'm trying to say --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Are you okay?
Okay, I get the point.
It's the sequel.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
I'm Cindy.
Stop touching his brain!
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
What the hell are you doing?
What are we gonna do?
My child, you're alive!
Yes, we made it!
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Saw who?!
I finished all the interviews.
Here you go, Professor.
Would you please focus?
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
Professor, I think you should see this.
Professor, we need to talk.
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
And sexy.
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
You're not wearing a belt.
It's okay. I understand.
Would you like to see the girl?
No thanks.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
I woke up naked, too.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
Hi, Mom.
Did you hear?
Mother? 
0h, shit!
You don't think...
Bring her home... I guess.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Because it's the rules!
Chip, honey?
In here, Mom...
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
We can be real quiet...
I love that you're my wife.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Shhhh..
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
I beg your pardon?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
MOTHERFUCKER!!
What did you just say?
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Mrs... Sutphin?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
He's a good boy.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Murder, honey.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
What's he know?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
You can't tell.
I don't like this.
You scared?
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
We can't stand here all night.
Drink.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
How much does she want?
She could use a hundred dollars.
I'll give you a check.
I haven't got that much in cash.
How much have you got?
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Why, Mary --
I ought to know.
What did she want?
And that was all?
No. She asked about the trademark.
What did she want to know?
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Let her know what?
And then?
I don't know.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
And the other was Judd?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
Yes. When I tell you.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
Would they hurt her?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'm afraid not.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
That makes it all the more difficult ——
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Ann?
Yes?
That was quick.
Television?
Yes.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Nine years.
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
What's the first?
Would you mind?
So what about kids?
Kids? What about them?
You're what?
Impotent.
My therapist said that --
You're in therapy?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
What are these?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Who's Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
No.
What... what are these interviews about?
About sex?
Yes.
What about sex?
Everything about sex.
And they just answer them?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I'm sorry this came up.
This is just... so...
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
How did you know?
She said it on her tape.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What do you have to do to get ready?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Do you talk to him?
Yes.
Yes.
About who?
I fantasized about you.
About me?
No.
On tape?
So you lied to her?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Interesting analogy.
I'm babbling.
I'm not in love with you.
But if you were?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I can't.
Why not?
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
But you're planning to be?
Don't do that.
John?
Who'd you have lunch with?
But I'm not.
I'm not either!!
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Goddam right.
Bastard...
You son of a bitch!!
God damn you!!
What do you mean?
Did you masturbate?
So it was recently that you tried this.
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
But he won't.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
No, I didn't.
No, it's nothing like that.
I don't want to talk about it.
Then why'd you call me?
He just asked me questions.
What kinds of questions?
Yes, I did.
Cynthia!
Why did you do that?
Because I wanted to.
But why did you want to?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
Did he touch you?
No, but I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
I don't want to discuss it.
Here it is.
What is it?
It looks like a tablecloth.
Thank you.
Bye.
There's a phone here.
Who are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
Doing what?
Talking.
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
You just want to ask me questions?
And that's all?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Is that what he tells you?
Hello.
I can't talk you into it?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
John?
Hello.
Not today. I've got other plans.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
Hello.
Do you want me to stop calling?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Who?
No.  You said three-fifty?
Plus first and last month deposit.
Will you lease month-to-month?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Really. How'd it go?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Give me your keys.
IBM.
Brian Kirkland, please.
John Millaney.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
He said immediately.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
No, nothing.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Kiss, kiss?
No. I don't think so.
Well? Supper at my place?
But where are you going?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Want me to breathe deeply?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Yes?
I don't get it.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.

You bet, Bert.
How's Brad?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
What?
Infantile regression.
I know, I know, it's just...
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
We're the experts.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
A free thinker.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Shove it, Ralph!
I don't want to get up there.

Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
But they only think they're happy.
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I'm sorry, Officer.

This could be worse than the old series.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
She walks in beauty...
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Bye.
I love you.
Are you there? Miles?
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Glass or bottle?
Bottle.
You okay, Miles?
They're just leftovers.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Anything I'd know?
I can't help the traffic.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Um... seventy... something.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
What do you smell?
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
It's not even a mile.
If that's what feels right.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
She works for tips!
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Have you no shame?
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Nice, huh?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
We're on.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
You should call her.
I will.  See ya!
Yep.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Obsessively.
Fucker hit into us.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
We're on.
I said okay?
You have to tell me --
No.
What?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
That's thoughtful.
Fucking chick's married.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
No way. No way.
So what's the plan?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Come on, let me drive.
I'm fine. You rest.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You broke some.
Well. That about does it.
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Love you, man.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I finished it.
Nice. Very nice.
Twelve months in oak.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I'm having the salmon.
How long have you been into wine?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Good. So did I.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
About two-thirty.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Oh, Maya. No.
Hello?
Victoria.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Ken.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
That was big of him.
That's great.
So what's happening with your book?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
About a year.
Both.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
I told you I need a drink.
So what do you think?
Oops. Sorry.
It makes me feel better.
There's dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
My ballet recital.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
Hi sweetie.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Graham --
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Curse and stuff.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Just make noises then.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Morgan, be careful.
How can you say that?
What time is it?
Where are you going?
This is going to do nothing.
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Merrill --
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
Me too.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
Yes.
It needs batteries.
I'm getting out now.
Bimboo?
What's two?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
Don't call me Father.
The footprints.
What about them?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Okay.  So he was tall?
Is anything missing?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
It's like War of the Worlds.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
All I did was kiss a girl.
What friend is that?
I think we lost 'em.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
...Gotta go...
Where are we?
You'll never make it.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.
McKendrick's men got him.
Gotta go.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
They've been kind to me.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
You must have known that before you came.
You're not Baxter?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
I gotta be going.
What's Turley like?
It's a town...
I expect.
Women?
Doesn't look quite fair.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
You haven't got any money.
You might make a farmer yet.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
He is now.
Get out of here, Jake.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What are you talking about?
I'm done talking. Get out.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
He was murdered.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Rae, I need help.
What makes you think I could?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
What about his brother?
It's been a while.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
You've got a legitimate job.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
You got a place to stay?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
Stella.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
It's the only place I'm happy.
Who's the owner?
What's this?
That's the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
I don't want you to get hurt.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
I'm glad we talked.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I can't wait to meet her.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
She'll drive herself.
Hair and make-up?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Even the fall from the plane.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
-- You can't go in there!
Viktor, you should have said something.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
When is she coming over?
About now.  Would you like a drink?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
So you did meet her?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Of course.
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Body double.
There's... a wall between you --
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
You have to see her.
I've seen them all before.
-- We call them "vactors".
I need flesh and --
"Straw God" changed my life.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
Hi, Dad.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Hi, Dad.
She still with Kent?
You know, I... don't know.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I do okay.  How about you?
Really?  Too bad.
I love you, Lainey.
Why didn't she thank you?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
About you and mom?
I know what you're up to.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Is it a jamming device?
Dark?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
My God, you've got one?
Mr. Sayer...
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Would you like me to read?
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
Good morning, Simone.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
The only real truth is in the work.
Wow. They called you their son.
Why did you leave me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
He hates me.
Know what?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What'd you write?
What kind of words?
That isn't magic.
Dr. Crowe.
What makes you think that?
Cats?
I told you what I want.
I have to.
When?
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
No, we're not.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
They're right here.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Lots of things.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Don't get mad.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Yeah.
Someone got hurt.
They did?
A lady. She died.
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They?
Dead people.
Dead people?
What are you thinking, Momma?
...I don't know.
Like what?
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
Chuck E. who?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
What are you talking about?
'Course, it's none of my business.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Could take a little while, though.
What's a "little while?"
Nope.
Get off his case sweetie.
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Someone actually... employs you?
Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Aha. The Lovers.
Looks like the alternator.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
Sounds familiar.
I could. You sucked.
Hey. Fuck you.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
He means moon shining.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Sure. What do you want to know.
-- It's not me!
Throw me one.
Ow!
Who? Us?!
Down boy.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
About what?
Then why go back now?
What about Jeremiah?
What are --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Get out of here.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Like what?
-- Where have you two been?
That's not funny.
Sorry.
What you up to?
Grant, where'd you go?
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Are you nodding?
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
What are you doing?
I'll get if for you.
I loved you. I loved --
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
How much style?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
But you could get killed, right?
An existentialist.
A what?
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Guess what?
I give up.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
Hey...
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
Kate...
What kind of a guy is he?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
Yes.
What's your pleasure?
Order up!
Cledus.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
No.
How long's this gonna take?
Bandit?
Why are we doing this?
Liquid gold.
Hit the brakes!
Let's get the hell outta here.
We still on schedule?
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
You can't swear on these.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Bandit?
Do I have a choice?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I ran into complications.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We're gone.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
Bandit II?
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker. Breaker.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Have any trouble getting here?
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
Yes, ma'am.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Five thou.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Is your security team armed?
How bad?
Mortal.
No.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
I've got concerns.
I'm here, where's the car?
D'you talk to'm?
I said I got his machine.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I am. Yeah.
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
FUCK YOU!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
-- will be handled back in --
I can't discuss --
...Does he know?
...So you made another deal?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Shoot.
A million flat.
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
I'm working on it.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
True?
What were you doin' here anyway?
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
I can trust Rheya.
You'll end up like me.
What happened to Gibarian?
Didn't you talk to Snow?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Yes.
You killed her!
She'll come back.
You fucking bastard...
He's dead.
He'll let me in.
Is there anybody else here?
My wife.
I wish you'd told me.
What will you say?
Kelvin, you awake?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Perhaps it did.
What happened?
Her oxygen would have run out.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
To calm your anxiety.
I wasn't.
And tonight?
Let's go home.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you remember?
Is it intelligent?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
What happened to us, exactly?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Yes.  Yes.
What's wrong.
But we fought.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Why did she do it?
Was she right?
No.  I love you.
But that's what happened before.
Do you?
What's wrong?
Gibarian.  He was here.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
I'm disgusting.
You should have told me.
You never said you wanted one.
I want you here.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Is that really what you want?
What does it want?
He won't do it.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Snow, get up here, now.
Claire!
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
You didn't like him?
Right.  That's true.
Can we go then?
I'm supposed to call in.
You live in Manhattan?
Are you nervous?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
You all right?
I'm sorry about what happened.
He said he'd kill me.
Claire?
Urdu and Hindi.
You were reading my Renoir.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
So it was "love".
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
But "nice".
What's to like?
You could do better.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Good night, Mike.
What do you want?
Open the door, will you?
Let go!
They called here after you left...
You told her?
Oh God, that's great!
What a memory.
Do you dance?
Do you?
Pretty bad.
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
Long enough.
Claire!
So.
You still going away?
I don't know...
Say goodbye, Mike.
Not if you don't want me to.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Keep what handy?
Tommy...!
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
My ass if falling.
My ass is falling.  It is.
You got no idea...
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Oh, some shit.
I think -- she's crazy.
Bought it.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I had to follow her to a store.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
She bought it.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
What was that?
What did you do tonight?
I watched TV.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Ellie...
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Ever shot anyone?
You're here 'til what time?
You should'a brought the girl.
Hold it...!
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Let my kid go.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
Okay, I guess.
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
She's taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
And Flash isn't?
Peter-- you took this picture?
Here you go, Pete.
What, want a glass?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Remember Little League?
I know.
I was there.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
You get mugged or something?
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Lemme down, bugface!
Are you okay?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Would you cool it already?
Frmpph-yrr.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Some things you should say anyway.
What if you get hurt?
Good morning, Liz.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
But you like that in a man?
Some prep school thing.
I'd never admit that.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Do you mind if I come too?
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Peter?
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
What the hell is that?
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Mr. Parker.
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Bonkers.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Come on!
Ready?
Roger.
There's only one pair left.
And maybe a little something else?
Have a cigar.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Not you.
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
What is this? This is water?
It's a mouse trap.
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
No, Animal.
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
So what? There's other women!
To the Brick Kremlin!
She'll never forgive me!
What do those broads say?
What do they always say?
That's what I wanna hear.
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
I'll open mine now.
Let me alone.
Let me do it, Hoffy.
You want to go?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
We've all done a poor job of it.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Says who?
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
You starting that again?
How do they know?
You told them, Hoffy.
Who did?
You did!
You could use a new one yourself.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Ach so!
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
December seventh, forty-one.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
It's working.
Target their Bridge.
This is its current position.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
We're within range, sir.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Soran?
All of us.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Yes, where would you go?
No, no. Thank you.
We don't have a tractor beam.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
That's right.
Close to retirement?
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
But I do have a theory...
A photon torpedo?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Sir?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Captain, are you all right?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Response?
What did you see, Chekov?
Aye sir, coding now.
I don't believe it...
Hello, sir. It's David.
David!... What went wrong?
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
I'll handle that later.
.          .. Spock's tube...
What is it?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Not exactly.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
This planet is aging in surges.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
... A cloaking device?
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Close... There --
No, sir, no response.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No.
But, why?
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
What I have done, I had to do.
Share this with no one.
Success, my lord.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
You amaze me, Commander.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
That's all you have to say?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Say thank you.
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Now that's what I call a meal.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Carol!
David --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
You're crazy -- !
I saw it -- !
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
What are you looking at?
The Admiral's son.
Don't you believe it.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Let them eat static.
They won't --
Tactical!
Inoperative.
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Time's up, Admiral...
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
She's not responding...
Try the emergency channels...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Give the word, Admiral.
Is the word given?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
... the good of the few...
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You earned it.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Khan!
Reliant's command...
Indeterminate life signs.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Time from my mark...
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Stop engines.
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Admiral on the bridge --
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Prepare for warp speed.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Certainly...
You lied.
Where must you go?
To Earth. To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
Humans make illogical decisions...
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
Can you isolate the wave?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Name?
I do not know your name.
You play games with me and you're through
Go ahead. Stun me.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Ah, well done, team 2.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Can you protect us?
I suppose they told you that...?
So you were at Berkeley.
We don't want to be any trouble.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
Just lucky, I guess.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's that?
All right. The truth?
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
Oh my God, we're too late!
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
The late 20th Century.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Warp two... three...
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
... Aye sir...?
Ready sir.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Bearing!
Estimate range, ship to whales!
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
How long, Scotty?
Full power, sir.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
With pleasure.
Well, that's different.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Hello? Computer...?
Just use the keyboard...
Transparent aluminum?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
But not you.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
... an offlander?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
You're what?
I understand.
Don't you ever get tired?
Really?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
Data doesn't breathe.
Won't he rust?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Is it safe to move her?
Hello, Data...
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
It is not over.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
I don't believe it happened that way.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Will that stop the tear?
You got me, Commander.
Options?
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
One. It's Ru'afo.
... Population three hundred million...
What are they interested in...?
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I believe you...
Augh.
Initiate launch sequence.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
How long has he been unconscious?
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
I do not know what you are referring to.
Isn't it better like this...?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Vulcan?
Can you configure it?
I believe so.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Who are you?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
This must be it.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
ATR setting...
Active.
Main bus...
Great name. French?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
There is no invasion...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
What?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Friends from Cornell...
You're leaving, aren't you?
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
That's impossible.
Track their weapons fire.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Agreed. Options?
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Are you alright?
We've lost Bridge control!
Emergency override!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
I remember it made me sick.
Worf to Bridge.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Mr. President.
I believe the operation is over.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Or not to be -
What the Hell's going on?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I didn't mean this future.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
Still think we're finished?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
If they're even looking for us...
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
We were until your torpedoes!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Stand...?
They'll respect him now...
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
My God, what happened here?
You feign ignorance?
He's a DOCTOR!
I checked the data banks, yes.
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You were demoted...
Yes.
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
She's here - somewhere.
They're preparing to fire.
Do we report this, sir?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
He's got it.
How did you know...?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Except us.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Captain, our shields -- !
Just the prototype.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I am uncertain.
Why would they give them to us?
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
Captain --
Gorkon's own man??
A lie?
If you are logical.
I don't want to.
Direct hit -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
A computer canna lie, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
And if they're still in place?
Fuzzy face is gone.
I do not understand.
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Now, you make a toast.
He is very observant.
Data!
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Ready, Captain.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
We are being hailed.
Negative.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
It's you.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
Do you have a moment, sir?
I'm going to miss you.
How can you be certain?
But how can he? He'll kill you.

Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Aye, sir.
How long until he can fire?
Sir, we're being hailed.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Understood.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we're being hailed.
What's this?
It's working.
Not very chatty.
Strength in numbers?
Serving with you has been an honor.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
And the Senate supports you?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
You don't trust me.
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
Why am I here?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Long ago.
I don't know.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
He's a very unusual android.
My God...
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Find her again.
No -- this is wasting time.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
What?!
They're holding position.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Thank you.
What can I do for you folks?
Sure.
I'll have to run your card off now.
What do you do?
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
Stay right there...
Elmo's...
Where's that?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Contain it and get back to me.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
Hello George.
What?
I just retired.
Mrs. Haydn...
I won't let anyone hurt you.
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel.
Gear shift.
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
What?!
Eh... police.
Good.
Which way?
What?
What?
What?
Pancakes.
What?
Money.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
What?
Smile.
Smile... good?
What?!
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas.
Gas good?
Closed?
Gas.
No gas.
Who?
My... husband.
Shit.
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
Money.
What?
A drink.
You want to try it?
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
It was yellow.
Why are you going here? What is here?
I do not understand.
Sun...
Do you have a baby?
No... The closest...
The driver will...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Jennyhaydn.
Yes?
Goodbye.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Yes?
What is hell?
It's bad.
What are you doing?
Nobody knows.
Why?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
That was beautiful.
You liked my singing?
No. Get in.
Are you angry at me?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Where are you going?
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You are cold.
You're damn right I am.
What?
Good morning.
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
What for?
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
There.
Well...
I will.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Call the police!!
In the cars, too?!
They after you?
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Was there visual contact?
No, sir. Radar.
You married, Major?
Twenty-eight years.
It was a man though... right?
I told you...
Is there a reward in this?
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
No problem.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Fuck you.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
You can't just... kill him.
Forget it's there.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
We should talk alone.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Yeah.  No, not really.
So've I.  Too much.
He's been cooked-off
Okay... what about Strickland?
You just did.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Who was just here?
Nero.
Strickland.
Your sex life?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
What's his name?
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Forget her.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Black.  Jack.
And gives it to you.
No more, Lenny.
Whatup Lenny?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
Well, look at the plus side.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
You see Tran?
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
See you downtown.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Was this him?
Um... he was older.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
You're thinking...?
What's the bad news?
You heard?
You have the body?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
My God.
You're a... you're sick.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
He said it was a clue?
Maybe cause he's smart.
We have another one.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Who?
From the grave?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I don't believe this.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I was looking for a pattern.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
How long have you been downtown?
You work with Koessler?
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Yes I do.
The man knew how to dress.
The other reason?
He thinks he looks young.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
It's a no-no.
I've been thinking about this.
He's called a couple times.
What did you tell him?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
The tattoo?
Sue Ann Hanson.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Yeah, of course.
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
What happened?
Agent...
Unlock these cuffs.
Agent Mackelway?
Is he dead?
Was it Zero?
[Reality very risky.]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I want to help you.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
What did you do to end up here?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Koessler?
Speck is dead.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
It's over for you.
I know, I know.
You've been through worse.
Ever since I've known you.
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
What do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You're a comedian?
Yeah.
Well, thank you...?
Nikki.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Tell me about it...
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
It does.
Like what?
Anything?
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
They're out of Glenlivet.
Hi.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Let me just check on my boy.
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
You want this in black chips.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, who represents you back east?
Why not?
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
You're a comedian?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Well, I should be getting...
...It's really getting late.
...well, it suits you...
Hi, Mike?
I can call back...
...Six months.
How are you doing?
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah?
I miss you, Mike.
Right.
Well that sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
There's the rub.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I'll give you an eight. 
What'd you get?
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
Ah, there's the rub...
I just tested for one...
I got to at least try once.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Oh boy.
I'm such an asshole.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
It's kinda money, actually.
Who threw this party, anyway?
Don't call me ever again.
Hello?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
When?
Tonight, baby.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Wait.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
Cut that shit out.
She smiled baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
That's where we make our scene.
Double down.
I know, but...
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's go.
Mikey's the big winner.
That was so demeaning...
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I know she's coming back.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
No!
No! Not the camera guy!
No, baby. You're money.
She didn't like me, anyway.
She thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
This version doesn't have fighting?
No.
You guys are such assholes.
Yeah. You met him once.
...the Copa, in New York...
How you guys doing?
It's on.
Which one?
She didn't see.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
Tomorrow?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
...against the computer.
They're a finesse team...
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
What a surprise...
No.
Now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
...honestly...
...you're money...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
It's on...
It's on.
It is on.
The bear's got his claws back.
Be smart about it.
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
No.  You ask for too much.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
What's the matter, Carlo?
The food is on the table.
I'm not hungry yet.
Ba Fa Goulle.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Outside.
You think we'll go for that last place?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
When did he call?
You mean Tattaglia.
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
For killing a man.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Yes.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
I know about what you mean!
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
That's for you to find out.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Michael, what are those men doing?
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Yes.  Tell me.
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
How do you do.
Hello.  Kay?
He'll be OK.
I LOVE YOU.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
I can't...
I don't think so either.  I better go.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Don't ask me.
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
To the city.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Do you renounce Satan.
I do renounce him.
Do you wish to be baptized?
He talked to you?
You think I scam?
Do you recognize my voice?
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Is that good?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Hi Tom.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I hope it wasn't cheap.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
It's just an undercoat. 
Say again?
You know, a primer.
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
Could we sail to Venice?
Sure. I love Venice.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Do you have any brothers?
I didn't mean with you in it.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
That's good.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
What?
How?
What are you doing?
Marge-maintenance.
Hello?
Dickie?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
Far cry from New York.
Yes it is.
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
Frances?
Are you okay?
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Did he kill Freddie?
Marge, when did you get here?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Dickie did it.
Hello Marge!
Look at me what?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I don't believe you.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
What's your secret?
Which is?
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
Just kidding. Are you alone?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Will we see you later?
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Ten thirty?
What did he say?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Well that would be even better gossip.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You're such a liar...
Dickie Greenleaf?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even your fiancée...?
Even her.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
31 people.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I have!
You got a .44 Magnum?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
You want to canvass?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
My name is Travis.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
You must be rich.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Damn.
Where are you going?
I'm leaving.
This is sort of high class...
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
But... Betsy...
What about the record?
Keep it.
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Travis?
You forgot "sexy".
Try holding the match like this.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
For a fee.
You looking for some action?
A girl needs protection.
What's your name?
That ain't much of a name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
That's a nice name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
I musta been stoned.
Do they drug you?
I can leave anytime I want.
Can I see you again?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
Where?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You just gonna leave 'em?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
No Sir.
Got your license?
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
Physical? Criminal?
Also clean.
Age?
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
You would, huh?
Your name Sport?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
What's going on?
Well, I just, you know...
Things got ya down?
Yeah.
Had a close one.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'm a field agent.
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
I'll go.
Wrong.
Mason.  Mason?
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Partners?
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew?  All this time?
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
What about you, Delly?
I think  it's worse  now.
Well...
You mean,  me?
Do you... remember me?
Me too.
You look... different.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
You first.
How'd they get it inside?
And why not?
What was that?
Do you have the...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
Now, did you remember that, or...
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Here we are.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
No.  But...
What's that?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Ernie.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You bet.
Well...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Dad, I...
Ha!
I'm here.
Did you... did you...
Anybody take it?
A few.
The G-man?
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
What is it?
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
What's his rent?
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
I was decorated.
You can't testify.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Not any more.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
When was that?
I taught you that.
Sit.  Play with me.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
It's about me.
What exactly did you hear?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Yes.  Very.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Miss Hayworth?
No. Just a few hours.
I was wondering...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Is anyone there?
Yes, I did.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Mitch, let's turn back.
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Good morning.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes, but where?
And the white house?
That's where the Brenners live.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Thank you.
What name?
Daniels.
The little girl's name.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
What happened?
Young woman cut herself.
Gulls!
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
You did say birds?
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I got them all, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
Mitch...
Mother, get a rope!
You're doing fine.
They're gone. The same pattern.
But they'll be back.
They won't be.
I started to say... inside...
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
I couldn't ask you to.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
He's not home.
Lovebirds.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Aren't these lovebirds?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are they moulting now?
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
I don't know you.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I think you're a louse.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Do you practice here?
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Why... 
How do you know Annie?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
I'm sure.
Seven o'clock then.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
No.
I wrote the letter.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I told you what happened in Rome!
It is for me.
But not for me.
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
You have a job?
I have several jobs.
Helping travelers.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Really? Tell me about it.
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
It's so damn quiet out there.
It was like that yesterday.
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie, Melanie...
Melanie...
Don't let's take any chances.
Do you want to try your father again? 
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
What time is it?
Almost two a.m.
You must be exhausted.
The power.
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
What were the crows after at the school?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
For what purpose?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Not if they're starting a war.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
Then let's go. Now!
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
I fear he may have to.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
Ask this one favor --
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Well --
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Why, yes.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
I am the best man for the job.
It might be an interesting case.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift.
I take no gifts from you.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
What did you hear?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
Nearly a year.
How long ago?
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
I hate that picture.
Check and mate.
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
You lied at my trial.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
Fucking Zombie.
I heard you were looking for this.
You're him. Corvis.
He didn't kill her.
Daisy. How did you know?
I told you, I knew your sister.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
So you're going to kill him?
It's ok, it's ok...
Yeah, we do.
I know.
They botched the execution.
Just don't believe everything you see.
You mean Alex.
I do. Every day.
But you, you've had them.
You want me to walk a straight line?
I want you... to bend over.
Why are there so many?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin!
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
It's not what you think.
You killed her!
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I don't believe you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Are you an FBI man?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
What does that mean?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Go to the movies.
All right.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
About five months -- your months.
You must have come a long way.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
It was a wonderful day.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
I will be in just a minute.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Is it real?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I don't know how to thank you.
Everyone seems so-- 
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
May I see you for a minute?
What happened?
It must be twelve-thirty.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
You mean he has the power of life and death?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
No. That's all finished.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
All day.
Can't stand light?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
We don't ride with vampires.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
All together?
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<u>Four</u> to go.
Death to all vampires!
Maximum body-count.
The meanest!
We still going?
Honda 250, huh?
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
Don't!  Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
Where you going?
For a ride.
With him?
You can't kill me, Star.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
He's not glowing.
What's that smell!?
Oh, no...
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
... And stay outta here.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Are we havin' fun or what?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
It was a dream, Star.
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
Still mad at me?
For what.
He looks dead.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
I'm tired now.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Tell them to get something to eat.
I thought we were poor.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Oh, no.  Now what?
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Say hello to Thorn.
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Are you following me?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
What's your name?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
Let's go see them.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
Why not?
I know, I've felt it...
Take laddie.
Huh?
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
I was here first.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Mom's home?...
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Who are you calling?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Where these tracks headed?
That night?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
How you doin', old boy?
Watch Clark.
Somebody broke in.
We got to burn 'em.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
It's shorted out or something!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch it over there!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Where's the other half?
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
What?
What clothes?
You ain't tying me up.
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Anything?
In this weather?
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
A couple of hours.
When was the last time you used it?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
After all this mess then.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
Put that down!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Tie up Clark, too.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
What about Childs?
Get back!!
The generator!
Maybe it ain't coming.
Then we go after him.
Get your gear on.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
What's happened?!
It's the generator I think!  No power.
You hear that?
Now how did you get hurt?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
This is it?
Yes.  Just about here.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
You know of them?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Because you'll never die.
Last night.
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
It frightens you.
It's what they want you to see.
Machines?
Vox?
What's it all for?
Why did they built it?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
What's your name?
How do you control the Morlocks?
And what of the Eloi?
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
May I help you?
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Admiration?  My my.
I mean... well... affection.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
Holding you... again.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Tonight's the night?
What?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
What is it?
You wouldn't believe me.
Good night, David.
This... was my home.
Yes.
Your husband is dead?
You're not from beyond the valley.
How long ago?
Why?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
You can see so many here.
Good night, then.
We all have that dream.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
What's it all for?
It must have been safe.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Alexander...?
You lost someone.
Is it?
So you can use it now?
Yes... I suppose so.
Kalen...
Mara...?
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Do you have it?!
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Here?
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
May I get you some --
Might I ask why?
He said he traveled for two months.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
Where do they take them?!
What do you mean?!
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Then it's time to change that --
What did you do at night?
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
No, you're safe --
You ok?
Then don't.
But... what about Starks?
What about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
He's recovering on the third floor.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
My business?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
Do I know you from somewhere?
My father used to talk about you.
Sure.
This is really happening, isn't it?
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Why?
You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
But I like it I guess.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
They're not here.
They're not.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I've been ok.
Good. How's your mom?
I think so.
How you doin'?
And if I didn't want to come?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Why, what would you do?
I could try to...make it stop.
My God you look exactly like him.
How'd he get it?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
You have no idea what's going on.
It doesn't look all that different.
Why don't you help me?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
I did?
Who...who kills me?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I tried to kill my wife.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Can you drive?
Of course you don't know.
Well, how'd you get here?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Yup. That's me.
You like it?
[Beat] I do it.
Well, good for you.
[Beat] Why?
You don't think that's crazy?
Hon.
Uh-huh.
Hon?
Darryl.
What?
Honey?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Who's the nut?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
I have no problem with that.
Good God.
Oh shit.
What's wrong?
Stop.
What for?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
I'm a robber.
You're a bank robber?
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
I always knew that.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
Peaches.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Hello...
Who is it?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
In the back?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Oh my God.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
What do you mean?
Give me the keys.
Did you finish thinking?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
That's puttin' it mildly.
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Drive!  Drive away!
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You think you've found your calling?
Try to.
Thelma.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
It won't work.
Louise?  Where are we?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Now what?
Now what what?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
This is so beautiful.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?!
What?
Sorry!
Ready?
You do?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Louise?
We can change our names.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
What?
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
You're a good friend.
Louise!
Where?!
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God!  It looks like the Army!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Then let's not get caught.
You're a good friend.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
Hi there!  You alright?
Where you goin'?
I'll try to be more careful.
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
No harm, no foul?
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Nah.
Never?
I mean since then.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Mary's a babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
No You mean...?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Check.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
Healy you dog!
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Stalker, huh?
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Oh yeah.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Don't you want to know my name?
I already know it, Mary.
Some buildings I'm working on.
What's that?
I work with retards.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
I guess.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Fuck!!
Urrggghh...
All you want is a phone number?
I don't buy it.
You want her dead, don't you?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
What are you doing?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Hey, hey, hey!
What do you mean 'why'?
Turn her over to a stalker.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Harvard?
Kim and I are close friends!
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
How'd you manage that one?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You little fuck.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Good lookin'?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Holy shit...
Pat does projects all over the world.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
What's that?
What are you?
So you're a writer?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Go!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Get over here.
Really?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Is it the frank or the beans?
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
What do you mean?
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Hey.
So what's up?
How are you doing, Warren?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Tomorrow...
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Oh, still sore about this.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
And the second condition?
How's my favorite President?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I want an hour with him.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Secretary of Defense...
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Hey.
Hey. Nice tie.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
It ain't Geronimo.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
What journey?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
This is a restricted area.
Who the fuck is he?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Couldn't sleep.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
Meet me at base. Over.
Her oil pan is shot.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
What are you --
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What was he saying?
Why should I tell you.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Not no more.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What do you mean?
1868...
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
You're the Indian FBI.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
X22. Read.
Come back?
Ray. X22.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Ray...
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
No way. No fuckin' way.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Well, it is. It is that, too.
That's a big comfort to me.
I could be, too.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
It would have been really embarrassing!
Why not?
I saw one.
Yes, ma'am.
Where were you?
Two.
Two miles.
The what?
No.
And far too aggressive.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Harmless!
Uh hum.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Used to what?
Make what?
It dies. We live.
That's true. What are you?
It's not suffering anymore.
You ever think about killing another human being?
Come on.
And now I want you.
You always get what you want?
Food...and you...my F-14!
In that order?
I'm still second best.
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Just good luck.
Where'd you get it.
...they say you're alright.
I'm fine.
That's not what I hear.
I was flying...my responsibility.
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
What do you want?
What?
You don't believe that.
What do you do when you come here?
What kind of games?
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
True.
Now?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's three.
Looks like a tie.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Well?
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Remember one thing.
Can't shake him.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
MAVERICK.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
That's missile lock!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
I'm pulling up.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
What are you doing?
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Yawing right.
I know!
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
I've got it -- hold on!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Gotta go, man.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Just relax.
Is it the plane?
The plane is fine.
You're not supposed to...
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Well what?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do you want?
Did what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So I've heard.
Who's your pilot?
Tom Kazansky.
No shit. The Iceman....
You think you can stay up with us.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
You ever done this before?
Something bothering you?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm pinned to the panel.
Time to go.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
I was a victim of circumstance.
What'd you do?
Hear about Ice?
What now?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
ON THE NOSE?
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Figured it out yet?
Figured out what?
Nope.
I think I can work it out on my own.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Just below ten thousand.
I've seen this before.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
What the hell you doing?
You won?!!!
It was bad.
Morning, Coogan.
Yes sir..
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
For the same reason you are.
How do you feel?
All right.
Goose is dead.
No bother.
I called your house.
Or you can quit.
You may not think so, but you are.
I never heard that.
Not something they tell dependents.
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
Over there man.
Welcome to Mars.
So, where to?
First time on Mars?
Need a ride?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
How'd you find me?
Get it, please.
So why am I still alive?
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
I know that.
Kill him.
Bob?
I'm with an very important client.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
So, been married long?
Your sexual orientation?
Brunette.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Sleazy...and demure.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Amazing.  Where are we?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Where?
HER!
Pull them out.
Sit down.
Where's Kuato?
What, aliens?
You tell me.
Shit!
They sell fake memories.
Oh, Rekall.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Hey, Quaid!
What are you, my father?
Let me buy you a drink.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where is he?
Shit!
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Quit while you're ahead.
Is that better?
Who is she?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
...You mean it?
Lori...
Yeah, sweetheart?
Let's do it.
Do what?
And you believe him?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I'm not your wife.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
It was implanted by the Agency.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I suppose you're not here either.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
What's he talking about?
I love you.
I don't remember you.
Hauser left me a note.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Why would I lie to you?
I think you better leave.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
Not bad, for a hooker.
He's lying.
Where are you going?!
The reactor.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Aliens built it.
You sure about this?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Wait!
What?
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
Howdy, Rhonda.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
So long, cactus!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
What the hell are they?
We'll take your word for it.
Prairie dog burrow...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Don't he have a home to go to?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Like hell you are.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Yeah...but no ties.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Burt!  Heather!
The con...!  Oh my God.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Twenty.
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
I have to talk to your brother.
Gimme back my bottle.
Don't hurt him.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
I can describe it.
How can you remember that?
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
We're taking the other case.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
What, the lunatic who --
Eddie Dowd.
1530 Rivington Street.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
So what're we gonna do?
I'm not that desperate.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
Got any booze in the house?
You don't drink "booze".
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
That's right.
Racist asshole came at me.
Exactly what happened then?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
No.
...I'm dying out there.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
No, s-sir.
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Edward T. Dowd.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
-- alleged crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
You getting this?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Look. Mister --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Shu's the only one I know of...
And why was an exception made?
The phone company was broken up.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
I want you to kill for me.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
The stuff we got last night.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
An old woman and her grandson.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
Someone else has it now.
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Sort of shorthand.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Agent Desmond, it's...
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
When?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Maybe.
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
If I can smoke it.
You want a muffin?
Goodbye, Muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Where are the Cookies?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
No, you should forget about last night.
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
Why do you do it, Laura?
What'll it be?
You got it.
You missed somethin', Ed.
But Bob isn't real.
No... No...
Did you make me a tape?
I am The Muffin.
We're on our way, Baby.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
What about tonight?
I can't tonight.
You know it and I know it.
Everything, but everything.
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
You want to see...
Boating?
No.
Hiking?
No.
Eating?
You'd think so.
Sex?
You're getting warmer.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Can I take the car?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Laura.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Good night, Mom.
Fine.
Let me see.
Who was that?
A friend from school.
Dad?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland, what are you doing?
Did you get this from your lover?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
What are you doing?
Who am I?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
You're right. There's no one here.
There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
How did you settle on the amount?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...he wants to testify...?
It looks that way.
This is going to drive the ante up.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Just as you are, Sir...
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
Neurology?
No.
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
What book is that?
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
I am seventy-four years old.
I did.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Yes.
Say it.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
I completely understand...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I am seventy-four years old.
She getting good care over there?
Dr. Gruber...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Thank you...
How old is he?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Why is that?
What is it?
Thank you for seeing me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Overruled...
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
Well, then what are you doing here?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
You know what happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
It's locked.
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
What do you want?
Are you out of your mind...?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
What happened, Joey...?
I can't talk now.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
You use their witness.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What are you doing in New York...?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, there - open up!
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I do know him...slightly.
What's he like?
It's gone now.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
How long was I out?
Nothing there now.
It was...  ...one of them!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
Colonel - shooting's no good!
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Must be somebody in there.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
Come on.  Kids love horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Heather?
He's had some sort of...episode.
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
Diabetes?
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
Tomorrow night.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
He's on his way.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
In my bed.
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Home.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
What...what is that?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Darker.  More...evil?
Yeah...how'd you know?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Listen, dammit.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Heather, what is it?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Black's fine.
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
He knows.
You sound so sure.
Why did we begin this?
What are they doing?
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Well, that's all part of it.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
Albatross?
Where you going?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
Congratulations.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Why then.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Why'd you do it?
Can we talk?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Is it true Phil?
We all have problems.
Yes.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
Do what?
Where are you from any way?
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
My dad.
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Can't do it.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
So is violating international law.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
I should be eating with the crew.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
You do?
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
How would you know?
Trust me donut.  I know.
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
We've got a problem.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
About yourself?
You've gotta be kidding?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Swing up, son.
I'm sorry...
What are you blubbering about?
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
I'm from all over.
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
You black?
No.
You an indian?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Ready for another?
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Nice of you to drop by.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You heard from Reggie?
Used to.
What'd you say?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
No... She's fine. Back home.
You hitched yet?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
The Good Witch...
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
...Asshole.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
Hasta siempre.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
That bastard Pucinski...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
You won't of missed much.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Sailor?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
It's just another case, Sailor.
You got me, peanut.
Who do?
You think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You ready for this?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
Lula, you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
There's worse places, honey.
If you say so.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
Oh God, Sailor.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
And no AC.
Fan works.
Sailor?
That you, Sail, honey?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Sail?
Uh-huh?
What could I be up to, Lula?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was in Vietnam.
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
You must be my son.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
How can you say that, Sailor?
LULA!!!!
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Just a place.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Course I am, mama.
Six.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
That's not why I called.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
No.
Where?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Yes.
You got nice tits.
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
You snore.
Emily?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
She's a transvestite.
You're stoned.
Mm.
I thought you were tinkering.
She left me. Crabs.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
So. Is he any good?
No. Not yet he isn't.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Tripp.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
You stay there.
Kidnapped? By who?
Which is?
So modest.
Crabtree.
Who do you think it is?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Want some help with that?
So whose car is it?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
Such as.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Do you know he won't expel him?
You peeked, didn't you?
It's mine.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
I passed out.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
And your wife left you.
She told you about...
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You cold, James?
It's colder in there.
I'll miss my bus.
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
Really?
They're glass. The buttons.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
I had to. Didn't I?
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Can I ask you something about her?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Thank you.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
The guy on the phone.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
How's that?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Humboldt County?
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
Where's that?
Carvel.
The one that left you?
Jealous? Of me?
You're lying.
Want a bite?
What would you call them then?
I eat.
When?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Professor Tripp...?
Thanks for that. He all right?
Me? Sure. Why?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Hey.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
He cribbed that from Borges.
That good, huh?
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
You go first.
All right. This morning --
Emily left me this morning.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's gun is that?
Pow.
You got me.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I heard.
Really? That was fast.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
About the baby.
Inside.
He told you.
He told me.
And what did you say?
I lost it all.
I know.
Ouch. How many?
Did you tell Walter?
I told Walter.
Does he still love you?
You don't deserve me, you know.
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
I need a ride.
I'm not sure that's possible.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Walter?
Who's this ?
It's Grady, Walter.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
This is important.
Oh?
I... I...
What is it, Grady?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Who's that guy?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
As a heart attack.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
A jockey? You mean, like --
The perpetrator.
No, the dog.
I might have his number on campus.
Are you riding with me, James?
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Foreman now.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
How is she?
Annette? She's good... tense.
When can I see her?
I'm working on it.
Cherry.
It wasn't like that.
What party?
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
When?
I'm just talking, man.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Sure.
What do you mean?
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Their sound is quite musical.
How does it sound?
Try.
I can't.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
I have to go.
Do you come here often?
Don't you have friends?
Hiya, Walter.
You don't know?
I have no idea.
I think you do.
I would.
Got something to hide?
Too much sun.
You walked home.
The one with the ax?
You knew her?
What?
You don't know?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I wasn't feeling well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
What's with the boxes?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
So. How are you adjusting?
I'm adjusting okay.
And your new apartment?
Are you taking your medication?
It gives me headaches.
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
I'm twelve.
No.
Robin?
No thank you.
Does he?
What's her name?
I can't.
Your daddy will always love you.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Walter?
No.
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's getting dark. Go home.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
You seem a little hostile today.
A diary?
That's right.
No way.
I don't understand.
Reflect.
It's very good, indeed.
Try it.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have to talk about something.
I'm not that crazy.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
How long is this going to take?
We have a few more minutes.
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
They usually tell me.
What is your idea of being normal?
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know --
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
You're very late.
When did it all start?
I don't know.
Close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Who do you see?
Not so fast.
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where are you?
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
What?
Are you okay?
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
What picture?
Me?
What's weird about that?
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Southern light.
Is that a school?
Doesn't it get noisy?
What about bears?
What about them?
They could eat you.
What?
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
So?
Hey, that was... intense.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
It's been a while since...
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
I suffer from insomnia.
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
The worst?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
Look, you can go now.
What did you do to them?
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
You don't really --
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Their power. They seduce me.
I was always the one seduced.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Nothing. It's over.
Being here, with me.
What odds?
Which brother did this?
All three -- in chronological order.
I love my brothers.
Not ever?
You're scared.
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
We should live together.
Live together.
Just think about it.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Thank you.
I'm not scared.
Don't do that.
Sneak up behind me like that.
What's your fucking problem?
What's going on?
You okay?
Yeah.
I heard they were filthy birds.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
You got it?!  You got it?
Lord Almighty.
I can't believe you let them do this!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You totaled it, huh?
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Son of a bitch!
I don't know how!
Oh God, Lins... I--
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Brigman.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
'Fish'?
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Hey!
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
What kind of light?
Which one shall I wear?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Well?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
More so than the shark?
Don't be so humble.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Find anything?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Does it please you to say such things?
Claudia, let's get married?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Then I'll see you later.
No, Sandro... Please...
Why?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Why?
I love you.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
But where did you finally end up?
You say that just to flatter me.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
What do you mean by sensible?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Who are you talking to?
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Where is she going?
Giulia...
And where do you find the models?
Why don't you try?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Anything new develop?
Are you the owner of this place?
No. The owners are in Australia.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
And how come you're up so early?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Why have we stopped?
I would like to ask you something.
You really must do me this one favor.
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
Agnes...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
Who told you this?
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Of God.
I'm being punished.
Why?
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
I burnt them.
Why?
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
What do you mean?
It's not my time of month.
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Let's talk about something else.
I don't know.
First thing that comes to your mind?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Yes.
Right now?
Uh huh.
Yes.
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
Yes.
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Why should they?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
And then what?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Would you like to ask them?
Anything?
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
Not at the moment, no.
Would you like some?
Why not?
I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
One.
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?  Mmm?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I was a mistake.
What the child?
I'm not sick.
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
You can tell me.
I can't.
She can.
She...
Yes?
... makes me...
Her headaches.
Oh, yes.
And then...
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
I really love you.
Yes.
Who am I?
And why am I here?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
How did you have a baby?
No.
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
Yes.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
And then what happened?
What is it?
Someone's following me.
My bed.
What else?
What do you think it's there for?
Are you ill?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
She said Michael.
Yes.
Who?
How did she know about him?
Are you frightened?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
Of course you do. Who was it?
Who?
It was dead.
It was alive wasn't it?
What did you do?
???
Marty, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
Martha, it's you.
All I want is one more week.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Who are you?
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Yes.
Who told you this?
Do you still go to church?
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
Is that normal?
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
And you didn't try to find out who?
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
So, someone else could have done it.
Shortly after she came to us.
And what happened?
This was before her pregnancy?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Then help her.
There's another choice.
What?
Aquittal.
There's nothing here.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God...
What is it?
You lied to me
About what?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Yes.
Do you know what she did to her?
She molested her!
Because I didn't know... 
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
Bullshit!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
No, it reminds me.
All right?
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Do you want to become one?
Listen to her singing.
I'd like to begin.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
Of course.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
For the Church?
You think she's a saint?
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Where is she?
Who knew she was pregnant?
Is it because she's a nun?
For what?  An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
The baby?
And the baby.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Oh, don't do this!
Eh?
Lay them down.
They're yours.
They are?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
I'm a deserter.
Are you now?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Yeah.
The police station.
You don't think...
Spoil sport!
Ever seen one of these before?
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
You do - repeatedly.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Grotty?
Get him out of here!!
That's not your Grandfather.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
A butcher?
Gerron.
What's up?
Ringo!
Well ... come on.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
It's Paul's grandfather.
No, I didn't you did ...
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Are you pulling my leg?
Aye, I knew you were.
The big hammer?
But that's not like a real person at all.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
See you.
Books are good!
Parading's better!
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
A book!
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What are you doing?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Hello, Grandfather!
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Why do you always use your left hand?
No, that's his other one.
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
What little old man?
That little old man.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Let's go and muck in.
Behave...
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
You needn't bother.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Now get on with it.
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
You wouldn't!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Hi Norm!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
You've got a midnight matinee.
Hello.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Oh yes.
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
That's what you tell me.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Don't exaggerate.
Aren't we ...
Where's my grandfather?
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Who?
Down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
What?
Eh, what's all this?
I'll set John on you!
Oh... God... am I cold...
Is that you, Roby?
I feel like shit...
Locked.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
... I don't know...
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Any rotation?
Yeah.  Two hours.
Is it solid?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Close enough to walk to!
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
What is it?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
How do you feel, Dell?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
A transmission?
I have recorded the transmission.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
What?
You like this shit?
Okay.
Dead.
What the hell's going on?
Oh -- God -- oh --
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
It's really on there tight.
Hey, guess what?
Where did it come from?
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's over, Hunter.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Yes?
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Sounds like a rough one.
We've got six hours left.
Oh my God.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
I've completely lost their signal.
What do you mean, no?
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
Don't count on it.
We can use the flamethrower.
That way.
What's wrong?
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
No, it's coming.
<u>What is it</u>?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
Is it still dripping?
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
They're on the next level up.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Where are we?
Oh my God.
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Good!  Moisture content?
Anything else?
But?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Take us up.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Food-storage room!
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Which presumably means...
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Better?
It's a rhino.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Minh...
Where is she?
I found it...
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
It's too late!
Not yet.
De Vries?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Hey, Guttierez?
Alright, okay.  Look...
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Hold it, hold it...
Wait.  Lost it.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
It's alright, it's cool...
Is this the suit?
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Four.
And before that?
What is that?
Seltzer?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I... I can't!
You have to...
What time's sundown?
How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
Phoebe.
May I come in?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
You take charge.
Hungry?
I don't think that's funny.
D-day.
Aren't you?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
What time?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
I can't believe my ears...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
You can have one at Max's.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
She was magnificent.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Of course I knew.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Frankly, I don't remember.
Bill!
You've already met.
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Bill...
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Many happy returns of the day...
Yeah... I will.
Okay.
I love you...
It's a good thought.
Happy little housewife...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
She's a girl of so many interests.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
For instance what?
Thank you.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's all over.
What's all over?
Who?
The kid. Junior.
I must have frightened her away.
Don't mix your metaphors.
I will not calm down!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
I'll say.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Groom.
Hello, what's your name?
Why?
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
It's only one picture deal.
Also Addison deWitt.
Is that what you want me to be?
Don't run away, Bill.
- and for you.
You're quite a girl.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Lemme fix you a drink.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
Buy some.
The same size?
Oh, brother.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Birdie-
An answer.
No.
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
Late for what?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
That's all.
It was for my report.
That's the door.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Try...
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Mrs. Richards.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Of course.
You won't forget it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
There can't be very much-
Eve... don't cry.
I think I know...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Addison wants me to play it.
Congratulations, Eve.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
She's just outside the door.
How much time have we?
Roughly ten minutes.
How far to the station?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
It doesn't matter.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
What about Bill?
What about Bill?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
With tears?
Coming?
I'm glad Bill's back.
Well of all-
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Where is she?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
How's the new one coming?
The play? All right, I guess...
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I'm sure.
She was a revelation...
To you, too?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I placed...?
I just played it.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Anything to help you out, Max.
All you got to do is name it.
Promise.
I promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
I didn't hear you.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--it was fine the way it was--
--mine's better--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
Carl?
Yeah?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
All right, what do we know?
Hey?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
July of '71.
Goddamnit--
--see?--
--I'm trying--
Facts or theory?
'68.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You want me to be the bastard.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
Goddamnit--
--we gotta top the Times--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
It's nothing personal, though. 
Woodward?
You overslept?
Morning or night?
Night.
I'll never get out of here in time.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Donald Segretti?
You can't.
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Tell that to Muskie.
Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.
Absolutely--
Give me your checkbook then.
You've really got to go.
So tell me about the Times article.
What do you want to know?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
But they both worked at the White House?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Just tell me his title.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
I got Clawsen on hold--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
They are not my clients.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
To where?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Your name, please.
Security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
Where in government?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
I think so.
I couldn't say.
But it's possible.
--who you got?--
Howard--
--has any of them got an ax?--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
The what to what?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Thanks coach.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
What did you just say?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This.  Right now.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Why is this?
Not bad, Chris.
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
What's your middle name?
Come on!  I won't tell.
I'm glad you think so.
Why are you doing this?
Onions?
What?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
What about the game?!
You're missing the game for us?!
Oz, it's okay, I know.
You mean...and orgasm?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
No you haven't.
Do you?
Of course.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Fuck me!  Yes!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You can crash at Stifler's?
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Right.  That gives us...
Hey, where's Finch?
Did I miss anything?!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Holy shit.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
You're not...busy?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Don't you want me to?
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I still think you're okay.
After getting laid?
Yes.
So you need to change, right?
Well...uh...
Shame on you!
Strip?
Move with the music.
Jim...
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Kevin, this is serious!
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
See -- this is the nicest room.
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah.
I don't know.  How do you?
Victoria...I love you.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Then she said -- she loves me.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
I'm such a loser.
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Here, babe.
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
Also like sex with my wife.
Either way works for us...
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Sure. I can follow that.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Salots! Shitfucker!
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
Hello?
I know. He told me.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Holy mother of God...
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We don't both have to die.
Didn't even have to ask.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Pull over! Now!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Another step and he's dead!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
You recognize her?
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Andy...
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Now!
Merde.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Why were you so late tonight
I was showing Sonya something . . .
What were you showing her?
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Are you running away?
Where is your home, Anya?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Is everyone all right?
No! I look ridiculous!
You'll laugh.
I shant!
Poor Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
By pulling my hair?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm so scared...
Don't let me go!
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
Trust me, it's her!
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
It's her.
He's her?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
The "Odessa Dunk"?
I'll show you!
Please, if you'd just listen...
And tell me that she's happy.
You gave the orders!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
This guy's on television.
Can I have your autograph?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Allison.
Yeah? Allison what?
Well, why not?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Right!  Where?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
For yuh.
All right.
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh, right.
Nice car.
Don't be funny.
You want your tennis stuff?
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Oh, yeah.
Neat?
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, huh?
Fifteen years, yeah.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
No, so help me.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah!
Yeah?
Hey, listen, listen.
What?
Okay.
Okay?
We can digest our-
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
As Balzac said...
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
Hey?
You see, like you and I...
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
You- Do you love me?
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
I have a tiny apartment.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Really?
Are yuh?
I didn't follow you!
Well, what is your definition of following?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Will it change your wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
I'm following you and David, if you-
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Oh. What?
Very big spider.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, Jesus, really?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah, but it's real close.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Here's a real present.
What... huh?
Christ!
Oh, good. Okay.
God.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
This is my room.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
Step up here!
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Don't get upset!
I can't.
My head is throbbing.
Oh, you got a headache!
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
You have a raccoon?
Are you?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
Probably on their first date, right?
Oh, do yuh?
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Charlie Chaplin.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Sixteen years ago.
Whatta you mean?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Yeah, watch the road!
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know, I mean, I-
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
You fired the cleaning woman?
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
So the colored have enough trouble.
They're persecuted enough!
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh. What about?
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
There's a whole wing in this house.
I was a great beauty.
There were many men interested in you?
Very well.
Was it a contractor?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Had a little help?
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
It's going.  It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's got great tits.
She's a constant surprise.
No, what?
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
She already has.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
He's allergic.
Oh.
To dander.  Otis.
Oh.
Didn't I say?
Borrow whatever you like.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Never.
You should have brought him.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
And you're not the wife.
It's not a contest.
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
Sally?
What is it?
Harry called.
And?
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
You need to call your dad.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Let me heal you, baby.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Go.
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.
Give him a minute, Clair.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Anytime, sport.
We closed.
We've only been over this how many times?
You only made half your quote this year.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Not millions.
He's directing now.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Yes.
Did he promise?
You're out of your mind.
Take your time, Jer.
Ryan's novel.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Hardly...
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
I'm going to throw up.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Truce?
Dolphins.  Great.
She left the fucking gate open.
He'll find his way back.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
What are you saying?
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Cal, too?
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Anyone else?
You changed your mind.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
I'll never forgive you.
I don't want to go tonight.
No.
Happy anniversary.
It's a Calder.
I know.
Panes!  How are you?
Oh, you know, I am.
What's a sign for that?
Coffee?
We have a gift?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
It's a novel.
Don't be silly.
You lose this?
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
And you know, he really does not.
I need to leave you now.
Lemon or raspberry?
Lemon.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
How long have you been married?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
That's very nice.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
What?
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I so wish I'd known.
Do you need anything else?
I was impressed.
The charades.
Thank you.
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Would you, like, marry him?
If he were still alive, maybe.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
You don't know she's a bitch.
Fuck you, Panes.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I wasn't finished.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
We're just feeling our way back.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Monica and Ryan.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
I don't mind...
He's a novelist.
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
I trust you.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
You weren't exactly horrified.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
Invisible!
Someone who follows his heart!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
And you are...?
You dance...
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Worker!  Come back here now!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Want a list?
So what makes you so special?
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Bala!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Z!  Over here!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Oh, no, sir!
Good.  You're a good soldier.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
Ask me why we're so successful.
Why are we so successful?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Wear this.
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
This the place?
So this is your mother's apartment?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Say, you got a lulu.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
You mean tonight?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
I forgive you.
Three.
You all right? What's the matter?
This is a bad day for me.
What is it?
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Here. How about some breakfast?
No -- I don't want anything.
Someone from the office.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
His apartment?
I mean -- her apartment.
When are you coming home?
As soon as I can walk.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I'm not very good at it.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
You really think so?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Sure.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
Who'd care?
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
For me?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Here.
Are we dressing for dinner?
No -- just come as you are.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
The dishes?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
That's very wise.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you all right?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I'm fine all over.
Mind if I come in?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Baxter?
I don't know.
The Vice Squad?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Relax, Baxter.
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Well -- I guess so.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
Now you're being bright?
Baxter?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
No, no -- just had a little accident.
You?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Hi, Baxter.
What do you want?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
She going to be all right, Doc?
What's her name?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
How's the patient?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Not so rough, honey.
Good night.
Good night?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Who?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
That guy really must've belted him.
Doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Come on, Fran.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
How long has it been -- a month?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
It's been hell.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Remember what we talked about?
We talked about a lot of things.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
You're not being funny.
Handle what?
I have that date -- remember?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Where do you live?
I told you -- with my mother.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Did you have a nice Christmas?
See if they'll what?
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
My men --
One for all -- all for one --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Who the hell are you?
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Delta ?
No.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
Rangers, eh?
Tracks ?
A long time.
Chef.
Why they call you that?
What are you doing out here?
What do you see?
Probably is.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
Looks that way.
Who's he?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
They're not Cong.
When'd you do it?
Listen.
What is it?
Which way? Right or left?
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
You didn't like him.
Ours.
Yeah, it still runs.
What -- happened here.
How did they know?
No, sir.
This gentleman or myself ?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Good swell.
They far enough?
The wind --
Boss left.
How big it is?
Change.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
I got bored in Saigon.
What'd you do for supplies?
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Fucking savages.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...
How's the pain?
Gimme water.
I think think a lie stinks.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
The other one --
Why did they attack us?
Who are you?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I should be checking on the boat.
Are you warm, Captain?
Right now -- I am.
That's 27, sir.
Beverly Hills --
Let's go.
184  CONTINUED:
212  CONTINUED:
Had?
She's dead.
What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll go into town with you.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
That's not what I meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Be careful, okay?
What's going on?
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
New to the country, kid?
Does he have people?
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Have to get these wet things off.
Told you I'm fine!
How many do you see?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Don't bet on it.
Shut up!
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I need to rent a cabin.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
I'm too old for this shit.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Thought that door was open last night...
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
There's what they're waiting on!
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What is it you want? What?
Do you love me?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
I know. He's just the best.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
His name?
Spencer.
Okay.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
How old are you?
How do you know about my mother?
Uh, Udall?
Carol the waitress?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
What's that got to do with it?
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
I was going to do that for you.
And mean it...
Sex with Simon?
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I'll take a bus.
Hello.
Yeah... Well...
How you doing?
I can trust my brain.
I should've danced with you.
Okay. Good-bye.
What do you want, Melvin?
Were you asleep?
What job?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
Good night.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But what about...
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
What are you trying to do to me?
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Shall I get her for you?
No. Please, don't force him.
Oh, is he dead?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Go away.
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Now we'll both call him.
Come on, sweetheart...
You consider your life easy.
Another place where?
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Is there a problem?
Where?
What?
What restaurant?
So you're from around here?
Where you from?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
You're right.  Talking too much again.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
How long have you been freelance?
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Five million dollars?
I'm on the scent.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Sick.  The flu.
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
The contract?
I bet you fucking know!
Um, five.
Get on the expressway.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Bullshit.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Now what?
Okay.  How did you find me?
'Them'?
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
Because he is trying to retire me.
Yes.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Just Electra?
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
No.
It's not the same, is it?
I killed him.
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
Why not?
But you knew what they were training you for?
The exotic women.
Women?  No... not really.
Because you are a women.
Yes.
Are they usually like that?
After that?
They become complicated... messy.
Did it ever bother you?
Several.
Good.
Where is it?
Thinking.
About?
I don't know.
No.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
Okay.
You should knock.
How was the beach?
Two way?
Okay.  Then what?
For Nicholai?
Ten years ago.
Yes.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
No.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
Yes.
What happened to her?
She was taken.
Honestly?
That doesn't sound normal.
Martin.
Four minutes.
Okay.
Electra --
What?
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Hi.  Did you call --
Would you like a drink?
You're very good at this aren't you?
For what?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Thank you.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Why didn't you fade?
You mean quit?
This will take some time.
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
A coke, if they have it?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Oh yeah, what's that?
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Need any disks?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Like helping a sick kid?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
We're going to need it all.
So why didn't we?
Afternoon!
Like a hand?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Red or white?
No, not yet.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
No, the boyfriend.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Tell me some bad news?
So I hear.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
WE gotta think of something.
Did you see anything in the files?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
God, I think I need a holiday.
What about me?
You're sure?
No, by road?
Take this exit.
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
It's that one isn't it.
Doug?
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Sure. Excellent.
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
What? You are crazy!
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Okay?
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
What for?
Will this thing take long?
No, it should be over soon.
I thought I'd help out.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
We_re not all running away
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
No, just a coffee.
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
I had it coming from someone.
Run into Josh?
Yeah, but it was okay.
Hmm, I still owe him.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
It was the biggest I could find.
Enjoying our hospitality?
I'm not sure it's possible.
Hey Doug, where you been?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
I don't want to go.
That's my bag.
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Why are there still such headlines?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
So go dance.
With you.
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
What if they expel you?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
'Bout what?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
Out with Belinda?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You're fine like that, Mom.
To see your father?
Late night.  You?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
What are you doing here?
Hypotheticals --
The address?!
Deranged.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'Is it really me?'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
Like me.
I'm an enemy?
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
What is that?
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Looking for intelligent life?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
You're really into God, right?
My relationship with God is my own.
You have to believe to have faith.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
You're not in a very good mood.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
All of it.
It's not.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Like fire.
What?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Your turn.
Before we do this.
Excuse me?
Stand right here.
You're sometimes not sure?
We can measure wind.
Assholes. This happen to you?
Come on.
Where?
What would you do up here?
When did you build this?
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
Jamie --
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Nope.
Anything you want.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
I've talked to your father.
You know how to waltz??
How you doing?
How're you doing?
Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
It was a play.
No. I want what's best for you.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
This week.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
You've been well?
Yes. You?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
When do I get time for me?
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?
Morning Dick.
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
What's N.R.C.?
Fine.
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
But he didn't ask me.
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Fine..
Learn anything?
Oh yeah.
Well... yeah...
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
I'm going to be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
Why?
Maybe if I used my left....
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You have a name?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
What year?
Eight thirty.
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Catch you later! 
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor? Professor Brown?
An atomic bomb.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Well, it was there.
I know.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
What? 
I run this place! 
Suzy!
What did you do to your hair?
Hi. where's Cato?
Well, he's gone.
What's going on?
How you doing, Cato?
Yeah, I guess.
That's what he told you, huh?
Does he bite?
You ever held another job before?
You lost that one?
Mmmmm.
You like people?
Well, Kit...
Thanks.
Is that right?
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Jack.
You love him?
You still in school?
He'll say that?
Nothing.
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Well, I got homework.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
What a nice place.
But it would hurt.
How bad off is he?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
How you doing?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
You tired?
I don't want a steak.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
No.
Positive?
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Have you got a better idea?
This your place?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
You didn't walk out here.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Wanta sue me?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
There's another one we owe 'em.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
We will, old fried, we will.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
Dead.  Damnit!
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Where're you goin'?
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
She was killed, Penny.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
John Whorfin will kill us!
No, sir.  I think the flint...
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Pick those up, Reno.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
How about you? Will you be alright?
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
How d'ya like your room!
...Who is this?
...Who?
...Hello.
How long you been up there, Fink?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
I beg your pardon?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Ever act?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
He's a great writer –
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
...Barton, is everything okay?
Sound a little what?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Can be. Not easy, but –
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Howdy, neighbor.
...Yeah, okay.
What do you mean?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
...Can I come in?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Barton. Are you all right?
No... Can I come in?
Why don't we go to your room-
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Hold on –
You gotta believe me –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
...Where did we put him?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I – Mr. Lipnik –
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Fink.
...Okay
L.A.P.D.
Is this multiple choice?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
All of which he's now missin'.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
He teach you to do it?
Where were you tonight?
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.
It's been three months.
No.
Yes.
You okay?
What are you doing here?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Who?
I need a cigarette.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
No, Nick, please --
Who?
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I had him in two classes.
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes, you do.
I told you -- I quit.
How did you feel when he died?
Am I... disturbing you?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I like you.
Don't get too cocky.
Fine.
What if I call you Nicky?
My wife used to call me that.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
I'll risk it.
How's your shoulder?
Fine.  How's your back?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
You shouldn't play this game.
It's OK.  It's OK.
No.
You won't believe me.
Do you believe me?
I don't know.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No thanks.
What are you researching?
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Why?
I finished my book.
How did it end?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
How did he die?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What was the weapon?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Were there ever any suspects?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
What kind of talk?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
What's goin' down, son?
I got tired of being played with.
I don't know.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You feeling better?
Why the hell not?
I don't believe it.
Why not?
Catherine told me what was in it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
Were you with him last night?
Are you kidding me?
So what do we do -- nothing?
You sure?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Fuck you, Phil.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
She's a suspect.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
Yes I did.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
Can there be some mistake?
No. Should I have?
I'm a painter, too.
Hey – it's the big A.M..
Is this finished yet?
I don't know.
When's your show?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Of what?
Saddle River, New York!
It's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ouch..
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
Who is it?
Annina Nosei.
These are great.
How much for these five?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I didn't see you.
What do you mean?
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
What?
I'm not black.
You're not?
Not what?
Really?
Yeah.
Paint it out.
It's Andy again.
Still not here.
– In this corner?
Who am I?
SAMO.
About what?
Check you later, man.
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
I don't really have any problems.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Can I walk you home?
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Party girls? Can I call you?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I hadn't thought about it.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
It looks done.
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
Hi.
How is he?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Is that the best quality you have?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
I really... admire you.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
So shut up and keep painting..
That one's for you.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
'Phillips head,' right?
I need this?
It's cold.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
Hanging on every word.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
We've met.
Didn't I say that?
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I'm listed.
Pouring myself into my work.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nope, I told her everything.
Photojournalist.
Nor I, on the second.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Y'mean frame him?
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Son!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
... eight, seven...
Silent night, violent night...
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
You certainly will not.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
It's good to see you.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I'm on break from-
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Please be looking for me.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
What exactly are you doing?
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Watch the first step.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Umm-hmmmm.
How did you...?
No beauty...
We gotta get those locks changed.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Who's Ivy?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Like hell you do.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Make yourself right at home.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
What?
...A bat.
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
What do maniacs always want?
Letters in the alphabet.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
Up here, Al.
Just checking, young sir.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Wait. You can't go.
So glad you could come.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
Rinka.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
That's usually my line.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Like normal folks.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
He sure did.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
Okay. I'm outta here.
Edward...
Who is The Batman, Edward?
_We_ sure are.
I got family. ...Please.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
About what?
A-14.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
GET IN THE CAR!!
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
Maybe we should just kiss.
All street mimes should be executed.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Got it!
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
I missed you, Lieutenant.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
That's it?
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
What were you thinking?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Allie, he's not.
Not what?
HOLY SHIT!!
And what did you say?
Scottish.
Hi,
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Sort of half.....
Everything's gonna be fine.
Two dollars please.
Goodnight Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Ahm.....
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Howls he getting on with the family?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Of course.
And a car.
Welsh.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
But is she gonna be okay?
Doctor Jacobson?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Interesting suit.
Why thank you sir.
Nope.
Of course he is.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
What's gone?
What?
No it wasn't!
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
What's your problem Beavis?
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Me first!
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
Damn, huh huh.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh...
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Bunghole...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Does that say Xanax?
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
You see what I see, Bork?
Cavity search...?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
Not on him, Chief.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You scored with two chicks?!
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
No, Jane.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Oh no.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Wave at the lion.
You'd better sit down, hon.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't think we survived the crash.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
<u>You</u> left me.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Of course I did.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Let's see if she can get my model back.
What...?
What time is it?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We were trying to scare your mother.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
What is going on?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Are you available?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
We're...
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
I want to get in.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Three syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
God, you're anatomically correct!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Your qu...?  But you're...
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Just don't tell Lydia.
What do you think, honey?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Where is your mother?
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Stepmother's...
The attic room is locked --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
You don't have a key?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
What's happening to them?
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
... And please call me Robert.
... Were you going somewhere?
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
... Do you think we should look for him?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I hope you're comfortable.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
May I ask your name?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Did you lose something?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
What is that?
Oh, I like that very much.
Chauncey...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
I like to watch.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Yes. It's a very good show.
Can you see well?
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
I don't want Robert.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
I want to tell Eve.
... Sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
What about money?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Try again.
Sid, it's useless!
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
And look who you brought with!
No, that won't do any good.
It's that gardener!
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Look, Johanna...
Yes? What have you found?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Yes, I did.
It's that serious, huh?
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Yeah.
Malkovich.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
I never played a jewel thief.
Who am I thinking of?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
The monkey.
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
The ferret?
The iguana.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I have to go back.
I have to go back now.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
No they're not.
You've always hated the animals.
What's that?
What about Maxine?
Fuck Maxine.
And he was with her.
We?
Me and John.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Suck my dick!
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
What's that?
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
A better friend.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Sure, after a fashion.
So how was it?
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Schwartz.
Pardon?
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Yes?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Emily Dickinson.
Who told you?
I'm right?
You're a fag or a liar.
This is important!
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Are you torturing me on purpose?
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Hello, Don.
No. Don't be an ass.
Can I be anyone I want?
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
But I think I have another plan.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Thank you, Floris.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But of course.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I'm getting divorced.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
We have to meet.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
She's not available.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Great then.
Is there dancing?
No.
Yeah?
Mr. Malkovich?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You mean with Malkovich?
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.
Folks came.
Folks come. Folks go.
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YOU HURT ME.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You don't sit with me!!
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Well, if you want my opinion...
You grown.
May I come in?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Be here. In case.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No. I mean work work.
Should I wake her?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
But mama..
Mama let me help you.
No...no...no..
I know what I see.
Better ask Paul D.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
You was friends.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You planning to do anything about it?
You remember your price, Stamp?
It ain't what you think.
Leave off..
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
All he can. All he can.
Sethe?
You shaved.
Yeah. Look bad?
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Hey!!
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
What do you think?
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
The Gundersons.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Come and get it.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Can we just rent it from you?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
What tied the room together, Dude?
What's a pederast, Walter?
I am the Walrus.
They posted the next round of the tournament--
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
I'm shomer shabbas.
Who has your undies, Walter?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
No--
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
I'm not really, uh.
Please!  Please!
Nancy's pretty good.
Different mothers, huh?
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Far from it.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Take it easy, Dude.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
"Johnson"?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
From who?
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Well yeah...I know that.
Jeffrey.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well...no, of course not--
I want a child.
What the fuck are you--
No, but--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Theodore Herzel.
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll--
The fucking point is--
What the hell is this?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
That wasn't her toe.
What about the toe?
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Uh-huh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Is the car out front yours?
Yeah?
Yeah, and you were--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Oh, shit.
He can't walk, Walter!
What's mine is mine.
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
Call the medics, Dude.
Well can we--
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude here.
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Is this a--what day is this?
Dude.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well?  Aren't you?
Yeah, but--
I'm not--
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Whatta we do about the Mex?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
Why?
Where to first?
What was that?
You're hurt.
I'll heal.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Anyone else make it?
Thank you.
How does it look?
You came back for me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
Where were you, Whistler?
Your security's for shit, kid.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Put it back in park, Blade.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
What's going on?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
From his father, of course.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Any casualties?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
She's been bitten.
What took you so long?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
Who dies first?
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
You used me as bait?!
But, he could've --
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
There is no cure.
What are you looking at?
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Like what?
What is this place?
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Is he sick?
Any progress?
Some. It's been slow --
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
How's it going, Kam?
You're a week early.
I was afraid that might happen.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
But you -- died --
Deacon brought me back.
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
We keep in radio contact.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
Why do you hunt them?
--and if she ever did--
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
What happened to her, where did she go?
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Domini?
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
No!
Mrs. Leavitt--
--I'm not staying here!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Yeah, so?
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
Jesus.
No.
You sure?
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
You don't want it though.
Your body, your call.
Anna--
You said the name "James."
Baby names?
I think we get the gist.
What?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
I can't.
I want to see something!
Absolutely.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
The, uh, blur there.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
You want a hand?
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
I don't believe this.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Yeah?
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
--Cotter: shut up.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Mi casa y su casa!
Fire escape??
Cotter?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
How's she going to know where to--
What the fuck--??
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
That's a "j."
Hold this.
--Graduate Thesis--
--Cotter--
Cotter?
What're you doing?
What?
Okay, but--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Running a junk yard.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Just hold on!
Oooh. Oooh.
Ah, Domini?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Still working on it.
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
What?
That's why she kills children.
You gonna be alright?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
--I know!
Heather.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
Anna--
"It's why the witch kills children."
Why?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--yes--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Your mother's pastor.
No, I--
...Ray?
Yeah.
What was that?
Where... where you going?
Who was it?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
You wouldn't be putting me out.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well I'll be damned.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...Ray?
...Where is everything?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
...So what're you doing tonight?
I own the place.
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
No.
Back where?
What did you take these for?
How long did you watch her?
Now that don't make much sense.
You want me to kill 'em.
Well what?
What do you think?
Yeah. Is it...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
How would I know?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
Pour that back.
What's this?
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Thanks Meurice.
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Come into the study a minute.

Look at these. What are these?
Those are my breasts.

Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.

Nothing. Are you alright?

Nice guy.  Who's he?
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.

No. I should go.

It used to make me laugh .but.
Yes. Frank-
I'm doing it.
What do you want?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You called me Jeffrey.
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
It's okay. it's okay.
Shh. I'll tell you.
They hurt his head.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What else is new?. right?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
What happened to him?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
That sounds good.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Oh, okay. can I call?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
You saw a lot in one night.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
Okay. be careful.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
You were late.
What am I going to do?
Yeah.
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead.
... Sandy?.
Hi Dad.
uh uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
You happy, baby?
You happy, baby?
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What?  Yeah, sure.
The coca is my responsibility!
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
Nice doing business with you, George.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Not really, no.
What do you got there, Diego?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Because I got caught.
No, my brother.
What type of planes do you have?
Diego Delgado, please?
Allo?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
I'm calling it three.
We're half a million off.
Where do I put this!?
There's no room.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
You fucked me, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Coke.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Freedom.
Power?
Yeah, maybe.
Family.
Sure.
Beautiful girls?
Money.
And Diego?
George, you look terrible.
Yeah, well...
Diego?
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
You mad at me?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
No.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
That was a beautiful message.
How are you doing, George?
What do you guys want?
George.
Figured it out.
George.
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Hey, George.  You okay?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Well, here I am.  See?
Dad.
You mean, like a trip?
California, huh?
Where are you going?
But I've got school.
There's schools in California.
I don't believe you.
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
I fucked up.
But I have a visitor.
Okay, George.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
It's not enough.
No shit, Kevin?
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
And here?
Sid Ahmed.
Second name.
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
Third group. What's your assignment?
You afraid of these ...?
It's true.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Can you read?
Read it.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Who is speaking?
How can I give you this statement?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
You got something on the coke?
About three hours.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
No.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Like cats and dogs.
No -- never.
Objection, Your Honor.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
She's innocent.
I've got work to do.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
A little after eleven.
I had some papers to pick up.
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
No -- never.
How did he look?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
About a year and half ago.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
We were lovers.
How long were you together?
What happened next?
I had bypass surgery.
It didn't.
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
You'll be sorry?
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
Why does she come to you?
No.
High school?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Yes -- he did.
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
He video taped you.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
No pain, no gain?
Something like that.
Yes.
This is your house.
Is it against the law?
I'm the photographer.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Hello?
Hi.  It's Frank.
Sorry.
Really?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I'm dropping the case.
You're a monster.
Alright, I'll talk to her
I love you.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
I can back it up.
I am relaxing.
Really?
If you want me to.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
I'll talk to him later.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
We have to talk.
I know.
It's more involved than that.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Did Marsh use it?
We were here two Christmases ago.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Yeah.
Michael.
Well, I'd like to read them.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I never knew that.
She's changed.
They got heat in Michigan.
Not this kind of heat.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Roseman Bridge?
Pretty country.
Maybe it's because I live here.
After the divorce.
How long you been married?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh there you are.
Oh, that's nice.
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
No, your kids.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
He's very... clean.
And clean.
Feeling better?
Is the dizziness gone?
She starts sniffing me.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
Smells like dirt.
You want to go back in?
Francesca?
Yes.
Francesca?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
What made you ask such a question?
Francesca?
Yes! Hi.
Am I interrupting anything?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Okay. See you later.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
You want to eat something?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
How about Italy?
Yes.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
No. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I had a temper.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Sleep all right?
What time is it?
Later. Go back to sleep.
I'm going to miss you.
Franny?
Okay.
What's her name?
Betty.
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
About an hour ago.
When did she decide this?
Don't feed that dog.
He yours, sir?
You think that's really him?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
We can climb out.
Climb out to where?
That's what?
Wh-wh-whooo?
You got a nice crib here.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Where are we, baby?
But.
Sorry, my brother.
What it will be.
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
You know I can't.
Aren't you going to join us?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
All the more reason I should be here.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Please...help me...
Nice rack.  How old is --
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
You haven't?
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
You shouldn't have hit me.
You want to get into this now?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Know what?
All right!  Where's the key?
How the fuck can I open it?
The same way you did before.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Where's what?
The next one blows off your dick.
Sit down, Gino!
No!
Gimme the gun.
I can't.  I can't.
All part of the business.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
They were early.
What are you talking about?
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
It couldn't have been.
Got to think this through ...
You can't leave.
The hell I can't!
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
We're going to need some time.
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You betrayed me!
We were in a car accident --
But everybody is all right.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
You're helping Rajeev?
I should be going.
Another time.
Lick me.
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Is that the money?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
So this is temporary for you?
Truck.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
A beer?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
No.
...  I needed that.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
What are you afraid of?
What you heard wasn't sex.
Yeah.
Yes.
That's his brother.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
He does it right in front of him.
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
An accident.
I'm just asking, what if?
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Not Caesar.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
It's me.
What if he doesn't run?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Oh, thank God.
I'm still here.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
No.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
What do you want to do?
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
Yes.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What do they want me to do?
So now you know.
So it's time to go home.
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Yes.  Is he there?
His brother.  You know his brother?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I've got a situation here and --
So what's in Paris?
I said ten thousand.
You have blood on your pants.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
I don't know.
What does that mean?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
What are you talking about?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I was shot twice in the back.
I needed a break.
Where are we?
We're about an hour away.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
No.
I trusted you.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
But the police --
-- we'll explain it --
Who paid the bill?
Nykwana Wombosi. 
I don't know. 
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?
This your store?
You have ID?
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
My husband's out looking for him.
Wait a minute --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
xxxxxx...
Sir...
Abbott wants to talk.
Tell him we're busy.
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
What if it doesn't come back?
You drink rum?
...Be back.
...your ducts?
Machines don't fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Sign here, please.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Er ... Thanks ...
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Her name is Jill.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
SAM! What a surprise!
Ah ...
How do you mean?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
What has Tuttle done?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Er ... no.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Say it was a mistake.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Jack?... Jack?
You stupid bastard!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Yes.
Is it stamped?
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you? Let go!
Ow! That hurt!
No.
Don't litter my cab!
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
You know, smoking's bad for you.
It's my fucking life.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
It does doesn't it?
It's heavy.
Looking for you.
No, really.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Cut it out, Sam.
Get away!
I was right! Step on it!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Oh God! What have we done?
Shit! The house is on fire!
Are you still following me?
I'm going to open it!
What happened to you after ...
They're gone.
Don't do anything silly.
Oh my God, a mistake!
It's not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Really.
A cheque.
Try next of kin.
Here. What do I do next?
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
Damn! Blast!
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I never signed the form.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
My mother said it would be all right.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry but ...
You remember Samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
What is it?
What were we saying?
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Hello ... hello ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No, sir.
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Yes?
Sign here please.
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
For God's sake, what's happened?
What is it?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Are you expecting anyone?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
No, no, that's impossible.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
She say she in great pain.
Is she dying?
You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Where is she?
I guess I'll be going.
Does that hurt?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
No. He's dead.
What's his name?
You're not going to die.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Here, you try.
No, I'd better not.
He's very very sick.
I know him. That's Noel.
Is there any chance?
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
Our Lady of Misery.
How is she?
He's better, though, right?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You asked me not to come.
I need to sit down a minute.
Who is it?
Frank.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
That's too many.
Backup?
Where you going?
I quit! I'm through!
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Last show of the night.
No.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
These are hard times, Tom.
Where you going?
The brakes are shot.
Mr. Oh.
Whadda we bring?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
What do you want to break?
Frank!
Do it!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Turn it off.
Don't push it, Larry.
Faster! God!
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
He's crazy.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
You're in the stomach!
Stomach again.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
What did I do to you?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Wait.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
What did they do with you?
London.  That's a promotion!
It's nice to see you.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
I don't like the word gay.
Which would you prefer?
A half hour in the lobby.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
He must have been great-looking, right?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Nine seconds.
Eleven and a half.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
We can cut back at the end.
I write for you sometimes.
Yes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I think you're the Devil.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Outside?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
The cost-efficient reporter.
We came from Washington.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
What is she shooting?
Jane?
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What did he say?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
It's Aaron.
We could...
Play back the last line...
He said something about...
Because...
Bad manners.
No...no.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
...good-bye then.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
What?
Bye, sweetie.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
You don't have to finish tonight.
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Hi.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Nervous?
Jane?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Why, you need me for the story?
Oh, good.
You okay?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
Hi.  It's me.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay.  Good night.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
This is very awkward.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Where's the bathroom?
That's enough.  That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Don't you work here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
What, right now?
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
Alright we're clear.
What the hell's going on?
What did he do?
See you later -
You really like it?
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Hi Walter.
More champagne, your majesty?
Yes Walter.
It's true, isn't it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
That's word for word.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Are you alright?
What's the matter with you?
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Man look at that get up !
Man this is heavy!
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
I didn't mean to.
People seem to like my cat.
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You know what that proves?
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
How ya doin'?
Did you see my cat?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
You're gonna shoot me!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Walter shut up and relax!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
Hi.
What do you get?
It's like...you've turned on.
You don't have to do anything!
T-tell him that?
If you see him.
Good night Walter...
I was just straightening up the place.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Well, um... litter?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Let's move out!
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Booo!
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
It's coffee.
You're the guys from the movie!
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Get away from here.
I'm hungry.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Excellent.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Dying.
Hi, Buffy.
Buffy, honey?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
What show is this?
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I thought we were meeting here.
Didn't you get my message?
You broke up with my machine?
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
I am a God!  A God!
Hi.
Hi there.
Yeah.
Where are you gonna go?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Hey, Buffy...
I know.
Thanks.
Who?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
I'm going to the senior dance.
He did what he was supposed to.
I crashed your party.
Pretty shallow of you.
That's me.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
) What do you think?
What are we doing?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Where?
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Ow.
None of your business.  God.
All right.  What do we do now?
I have cheerleading squad.
Why do you keep saying that?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Who we gonna beat?
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
They were vampires?
Same one.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Five?
Not if you're careful.
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
That is so cool.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
So very much.
Really?
The mark of the Coven.
I'm just a girl.
You think so?
Got that.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
No --
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
And Spring Fling.
I never thought of that.
Cool!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Smell of booze much.
Oh, thank you very much.
Except for Prom.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Ah, you'll be coming back.
I don't think so.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
The right nostril.  Good.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
How was that?
Just till I lose.
Get over here.
No, no, it was great.
I'll tuck you in.
That's my leg.
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I'm trying to play with your body!
I did.
We lost.
Well I guess this is it.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
I'm Crash Davis.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
She's dancing with me.
See my hips?
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Damn.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
It's possible.
I got released.
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Which one of us?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Will that work for me?
If you believe in Voodoo.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
It was a cocksucking call!
You missed the tag!
You spit on me!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
You're a cocksucker!
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
He did know.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
Sorry about last night.
Nuke--  Good luck.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Step outside, pal.
Take the first shot at me.
I ain't hitting a man first.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Can I give you my testimony?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
He walked eighteen?!
It's a league record.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
It's a damn convention.
What'you want, kid?
Jim looking for somebody.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Where does he go?
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Look at yours.
Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
You got it.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I can't! I'm tied!
When did this happen, honey?
I don't know.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
They payin'?
Okay, Sammy.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
No, of course not.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
All right, Ace?
Okay.
In other words, I'm fucked.
Hello.
Hey, Ace.
No, I don't wanna come -
Just say so.
I'll be honest with you.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
You lost your control.
My wife?
Please...
...don't do it to me...
It's none of my business?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Meet me at three.
What - what, Caesar's?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
And what'd she want?
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah, she's here.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
No problem.  Sorry.
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock?
You go and put your things away.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
I...
It's always been our policy -
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
To Abraham Lincoln.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Sam, we got a problem.
Now, he's really pissed.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Right away. Okay?
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
I'll be right back.
Hey, Mitch.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
Thank you.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
I - I - I...
You all right?
Yeah.
Why're you crying?
Yeah.
Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Why do you need that much?
Yeah, how do I know?
Yes, I - yes, I do.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What's it...
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Yeah.
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I threw it away.
I put her to bed.
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
I wouldn't do that...
You get down here!
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
...Well, I've got a large family.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
...worst possible time for me.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Well, I... I never tried.
So, you're a righty?
Excuse me.
Is this yours? Your pen?
Get out of here.
Yeah?
No, no? You didn't?
Thanks, Nick.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Fucker!
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Leave me alone!
Here we go!
Nicky, I did -
Is that what you did?
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's comin' over.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
He's not here?
Hey, Frankie.
How are you?
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
You got a round figure on it?
Yeah.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you?
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
All right?
Thanks.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
Mm-hm.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Yeah.
A sponsor.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's what you want?
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
...same outfit.
Come on.
Yes.
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
Okay?
No, Lester.
Right.
He called you right here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
...they're in Penthouse K.
They check in alone?
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
There's more!
Incredible.
Two.
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Smarten up.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
What's takin' so long over there?
Hey. This is Shelly.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Ch-Charlie M!
Charlie M?
Tony.
Hey.
How you doin'?
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
You sure?
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Hey! Oh!
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
That's enough.
All right, all right. But I - I -
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
Are you sure?
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Wha-at?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
What a "drag."
God-damn..
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
I loved you.
I still have one left...
You think so?...Selina?
Spooky.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
What did--?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Nice breasts.
Any place.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Was someone in an accident?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Will you two cut it out?
Are you guys all right?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You switched license plates?
Bullshit.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Got your badge?
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
Who smashed the phone?
My name is --
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
You won't disconnect.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Please.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
What's happening?
The one in Brentwood.
What do you mean?
Not a chance.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Lucky for them they didn't.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
It's locked.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
There isn't any such person.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
A typical fuck-up.
You were at the Emerald that night?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Naturally.
That's not good enough.
You won't live to see it.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Who is this?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
They saw you kill the driver.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't know what you mean.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Count it.
Seems like it.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
I thought you'd know me by now.
What does it take to kill you?
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
We're gonna get there first.
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
I already called for an ambulance.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Undercover.
Scottish?
It takes all types.
She's not a girl, Col --
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
What you think?
Saw that one.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
You see that, Col?
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
You fucking promised.
Did I?
Don't be like that --
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Look, I'm sorry.
What's that supposed to mean?
Not in my experience.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Guy I work with.
You American?
No.
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
You old-fashioned?
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
How special?
Jesus Christ!
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Must be in love to manage that.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
Shouldn't I go?
Maybe.
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
Do I?
Didn't think I could.
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Drink.
What is this?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
Even now.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Made me feel all funny inside.
You think that's wise?
That's a start.
Ask to meet me again.
When?
Do they know?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
Don't.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Are you pretending yet?
A little.
Don't ask me in.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Happy now?
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Don't.
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
Shouldn't be, Dil
She from Scotland too?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You want another haircut, baby?
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Why?
No.
You promise?
Don't call me that --
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Come on...
What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
You killed my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
Got to be somewhere.
You like me now, Jimmy?
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
It's my name, Dil --
Do I?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
Promise?
Lucky you.
What was it?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Do you now.
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
Was I?
And what if you don't?
Jude?
Who's the old geezer?
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
Give him a cup of tea.
Why would you do that?
Thanks.
So he knows your name?
You OK about that?
Peter.
You sure about that?
So it was you all the time.
I thought it was Dave.
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Thank God for that.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Fuck you.
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No fucking way.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Do what?
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
C'mere.
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
No?
Absolutely not.
You make a nice couple.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
What the fuck am I doing here.
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Fergus?
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Who's Dil?
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
If they kill me --
I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Don't.
Help me.
What?
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
What?
What if I did?
You didn't?
And you know what?
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That fucker's dead --
I could eat a horse.
What about it?
You don't look so bad in this light.
What is it?
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Let's look anyway.
I love you, Adam.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I said, tell me to go to the --
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Ours.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
I believe you.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Why not?
No.
No, what?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's Charles!
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Starting with his own.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Back where?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Whitefoot, of course.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
There, you said it.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Maybe.
Or Tex?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'd love some, thanks.
Alex --
Hm?
What? Assassinate somebody?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.
I'm afraid it is important.
In money.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
And if it is?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert --
What do you want?
You loved him?
He was American?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He didn't have one.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is it all right?
Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.
I don't understand.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Why, do you think we're going to?
Quitter.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Peter Joshua.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Yes.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
You mean you and me?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
What was it?
We're here.
On the street where you live.
What?
Nothing. Good night.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Go on.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But why do you want a divorce?
Do you know him?
I've never seen him before.
How can you tell?
Who is it from?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
I get all your CDs.
No.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Daddy you scared me!
It won't happen again.
Hi honey.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
A little.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
No honey.
You are upset.
It was a she.
You know her?
It can't be.
You were eavesdropping.
No I wasn't.
No!
Is Jody still awake?
She's still a virgin.
This will relax her.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
Can you get inside?
You gave me a 'D'.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Of course I'm scared.
What do you know about my father?
Who?
Mark Shale.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
You ok?
Especially not your dad.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
This place is empty.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Are you O.K.?
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
That's not why we broke up.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Jody. Wait.
What are you doing?
Hi princess.
Mom?
Lisa Sherman?
Wait.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
The principal?
Yes?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
You ok?
What are you doing?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You're so beautiful.
So are you.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Maybe it won't stay in.
If sheep don't count.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Rod!
You're being unfair.
Stacy?

help me get in the truck. 
 Oh...
 Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
It's a damn postal truck!
Come on, Night Shift.
...-ty.
Where do you want this stuff?
Great. 
That's my business.
No argument there.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since when does...
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Oh.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Peace.
All right.
You want cash?
You want cash?

There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
That dog ain't mean.

...all the time.
 Excuse me...

I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Borrowed.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck!
I did not steal this truck!
That's...
I ain't playin' that.

 
God-...
...-damn!
Ah, one of them's in the back.


Shut up.
Take your gun!
Doesn't work.
What?
Oh, shit.



All right.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
 Yeah...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.


Holy shit...

Oh, shit.


Oh, shit.
 Okay.

Come on, old...

 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Gee, you think so?
Shut up!

Ho, ho...
 Oh...

Hang on!
Hey!


 Shit. 
 Go on.
 Go, go.


No.  Shit.
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 

Okay.
All right.
Okay.

I'm a dangerous man!

He's crazy!
You're--?  What?!
Then stay...

Come on!

Keep still.


Oh, shit!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!



Okay.
...piece of shit was worth.
 Yeah.
Robert Del Rio?
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
I mean, if that gun was...
...miles.
 Whoo!
Hey.   Mason.
I think you oughta cut a...
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...or my conscience.
Ow!  

Listen, Arlo.

They're takin' off.
Huh?
They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
What?
Arlo!  Arlo.

 Come on!
Oh.
 Okay.
Yeah.
 Okay.

Okay. 

Okay. 

Arlo!

Okay. 

Come here.

...to him. 
What?
Go!

Stop.
...on!
Oh, fuck!
  I've got the real thing!
Here...
...they come!
Okay...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
What the--?
Shoot me. 
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.
What?

All right 
Oh.
What?
 
What?
It's working.



We got-...
...-ta get outta here!
 There's gotta be...
Sorry.
Hang on, hang on.
Let's go!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
They'll meet you at the top.

What'd you come back for?!



 Well.
You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
You, Arlo.
Hello.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Patriotism is its own reward.
 Yeah.
Thank you.
No.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
I feel faint.
 big balls.
Hey.
Be cool.  Be--
We're worried...
...within five minutes.

I urge you to be persuasive.
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Vaughn.

It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
Yeah, that's my truck.
Mason, you have to take this...
...take my sorry old truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
I had no idea how powerful it was.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Listen, deputy.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...including the permanently extreme.




They were all wearing hardware.
Doc-...
...to be off the island tonight.
And I changed the schedule.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
"I am become Death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
No!
Is this stool taken?
No, go--
You look good, Richard.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...and the government.
Grateful?
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Do you know what'll...
Brynner.
I can't say it's a surprise.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
...comes up that road.
Radio the bikes.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Hit him again.
Vaughn.
It's clean.
Check the immediate area.
This was supposed to be a...
Get your links set up!
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-ty.
...general store.
Richard Long.
Where's their protective...
Is this your establishment?
Assumptions are always...
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
I assume you have one.
Doc...
...time to time, yeah.
Not tonight...
...though.
Odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
I want you to look at one another...
...to die for a country that's...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
I don't see my container.
...-tainer!
Where's Arlo?
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.




 







No.
Where's Elvis?!
 ...checked. 






You'd never understand!
I can handle it.
Be sure you feed Bosco.
There's something else too.
Secrets.
Video lock.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Go.
Kabula's out.
Hit it...
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
...tight!
Is Elvis out?
And where are you going?
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
...-five.
Who's your suspect?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...-time. 
Excellent.
...is a perfect hunter.
He's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...and that power...
...fishin'.

Mason.
Call an ambulance.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
 ...miles. 
...you, Mason?
We've got the real thing!
Mason.  Mason!
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
Do you recognize this young man?
...you answer mine.
Got that?
I said let me see your hands now!
You redneck idiot, do you have...
 Listen, Pappas...
...on the other end of this phone.
Don't move!
What the hell was that?
  All right.
 
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, doc.
Get in 



Gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
 Talk to me.


Oh.
Do it now.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
'Course you do, Jake.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
How did she get that idea?
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Who's the investigating officer?
Do you know him?
Oh yes.
Very.
None.
His girlfriend?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
My daughter.
I've got her.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
Where is she?
What does this mean?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What are you talking about?
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
What's that, Curly?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
That's a filthy habit.
Then what'll you do?
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
Hello, Jake.
Summer colds are the worst.
You've done well by yourself.
Since when?
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
Or her name?
What are you doing here?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
I know what he says.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
That's it?
Yeah.
Give you three minutes.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
A complete surprise?
Mr. Gittes.
Would you like something to drink?
What are you having?
Mrs. Mulwray?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
No. I went riding rather early.
I'll stop by.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
I got your check in the mall.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
My husband.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Did you have affairs?
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
You mean you don't know where you were?
K... Cross.
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
You sure shout that?
I'll stay.
I gave everybody the night off.
It was in Chinatown.
What were you doing there?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
What's wrong?
Your eye.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Just... I have to.
He owns it. You know?
This morning.
She's too upset.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Where's the girl?
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Katherine.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said the truth!
I said I want the truth.
I'll take care of it.
Where can we go?
...where does Kyo live?
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie.
Sophie.
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.
Who?
There's just one question.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
He never even kids about it.
I never was.
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes?
Have we ever met?
Well, no.
Never?
The water.
What about the water?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
No problem with me on the Job.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He did or he didn't?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Course, she settled down nicely.
That's for sure.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Did you ever see her again? 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi. Why are you running?
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Father, I have sinned...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
My husband...you know him.
Then where's the money?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Go on!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who else you been to see?
I'm going back there.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Wasted?
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Is it good?
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Has he said when he'll finish?
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Hello, Brad -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Get out, both of you!
Toothache.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Where's the soap?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Where's the towel?
A chicken?
No.  But you're close.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
Susan, it seems to me -
I'm not sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
No, you're not.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Close the door, Raymond.
Raymond - 
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Can't say, sir.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
It's been a tough day.
Charlie -
Charlie -
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I've got to think of Emily -
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Thompson!
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Yes and no.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
How did you meet him?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Are you sure?
Am I sure?
How long have you been smoking?
You're shittin' me.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
She said not to come home until graduation.
You can hold me down.
Dick.
God, isn't he great?
No, this is great.
Can I use the bathroom?
There's no light back there.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
Very dramatic, I thought.
And you said yes?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I just told you.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You're serious. You want to date again.
Let me take you out tonight.
What about Sing?
Sang.
Sang.
He's not invited.
So what are you saying?
You're such an asshole.
How'd you get here so fast?
Then who operated the store?
Nobody. It was closed.
Are you open?
Yeah.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
Who are you to make assessments?
Like you're better!
Are you open?
Pack of cigarettes.
You open?
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
You only brought one ball?!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
What smells like shoe polish?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
You don't want to know.
You called Caitlin again?
She called me.
Eight and a half.
She called you Brad?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Oh, my God.
Great story, isn't it?
Your mother.
Allan Harris.
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
You know what I just watched?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
What's that?
All right, Vader's boss...
Wait.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Let's hear it.
The milkmaids.
No.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
FUCK!
Why'd you apologize?
You know what pisses me off the most?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
At least we're stuck here together.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
We're not playing in the street.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Yeah, right.
You've had sex with a dead person.
No, you're not.
Why not?
It's today.
If you go, I go.
I'm going with you.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
How'd he die?
Broke his neck.
Shut the hell up.
Bible truth.
Stop it.
I swear.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
Reach what?
You know.
I can't fucking believe you!!
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Let me borrow your car.
I don't want to talk to you.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
Why should I loan you my car?
I want to rent a movie.
Let me borrow your car.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Please, get the hell out of here.
And this is what you rented?
No way!
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
You're happy?
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
You just fucked a total stranger?
This life.
Why do I have this life?
You should shit or get off the pot.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?
Helluva day.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Yes.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
I'm her sister.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I am not.
How much can you bench?
No, she's getting married.
Are there any balls down there?!
Go open the video store.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
You used to go out with her?
We were going to start again, I think.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
Be careful.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
At least they weren't lit.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
What? What is that?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Typically male point of view.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
How many?
You're a pig.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
No; who were the three, besides me?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
He requested this?
He gets off on it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Please calm down.
How many?
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
Can I have your name please?
Here you go.
You said you were here all day?
No way!
Did he say "making fuck?"
Does he sing in English or Russian?
No way!
Feel that.
Sure. How about the beach?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I hope it feels good.
You'll be missed.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I'm not sad.
The guy ain't here yet.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Which one?
I have first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
That woulda been cool.
Answer the man.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Where are you, Walker?
The money!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
What the hell are you doing here?!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
There wasn't time for anything else.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Not on that leg.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
There you go.
Four...five...
Nice and easy...
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Do you see them yet?
Patience my love, patience.
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
You can stop right there.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
Why are you yelling?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
A flare up...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
He can handle it.
Let's be creative.
Of course I do.
It was great.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Gabe...your arm?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Nice view, huh?
Can you see light?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Pull it apart!
Never
Never, what?!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Reach up!  Do it!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Forget it!  I refuse!
What about you?!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Never could save a thing.
Where's the helicopter?
Yeah...
What's your names?
On top of the peak.
Then where the fuck is!
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Oh, my God!
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Rich...
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
Won't you join me, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Phoned some friends, sir?
Help me, sir?
Help you.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, shall we get down to it?
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Who said that?
I did, sir.
What crime did you commit.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Keeping fit then?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
No, brother. What d'you want?
I'm gonna be sick.
You're gonna be sick are you?
I wanna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
Crime?
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Brown hair, is it?
Fair hair, sir.
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I haven't seen you before.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
I was quite enjoying that.
And when do I get out of here then?
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Carry on, Chief.
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
What?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
The ride is free.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Like what?
Big case?
Most of the time.
You need a vacation.
How often you go?
Annie...it's Max.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I'm sorry.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
So?  It was a random thing.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Not our call, Phil.
...if they're wrong?!
I was with Max when he got the call.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
What's your name?
Try?
I've been calling and calling.
What's he sayin'?
I'm standing right here.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
He's not paying you one cent!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
You hassling my driver again?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
It's not that kind of job.
Me, specifically?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Max.
Got it?
Max.
You listening to me?
What about that?
You better?
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
South Central.
Are you breathing?
Music.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I can't believe this.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
Who's that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
So what?
I need the job.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Another collateral.
Collateral damage.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
Jazz.  Music.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
What you mean, no?
Max?  What are you doing?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
Limos, huh?
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
What, no insurance?
Gimme your wallet.
You get benefits?
No.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
One more.
That's what you said...
And you believe me...?
What happened to you?
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
The sound of love.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I never told her.
Why the hell not?
The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.
Drop me off here!
Look, I'm sorry --
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Saved you last night's, too.
Do you still ride?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You going to warn him?
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
Just relax.
Switch the charts.
What is?
People do have heart attacks.
For what?
You saved my life.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
That's it?
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Has this happened to you before?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Is this your dad?
Is he dead?
Please put it down.
How'd he die?
He's why you punish yourself.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
Connecticut.
My father's house.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
He gave it to me.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
I believe you.
They'll trace it.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Liza?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
Liza Sutton is dead.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You made your decision yet?
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
I don't know...
Can I ask you something?
A dog bit it.
And you have no idea where he lives?
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Working.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Which way did he go?
Agent Lowry.
Wasn't my idea.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
I want to believe you, too.
What do you suggest?
That you come with me.
Yes, sir.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
What in the hell...?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
What is it?  What's happened?
David --
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
What would you have me say, David?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
And?
No primer.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Talk to him.
Could we hear to the moon?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Can you show me?
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Am I one... or many?
So.  What happens now?
Now... you go home.
A page-break signal.  A period.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The systems integration site.
Ellie.  Arroway.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
We could be together again --
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Ellie -- are you okay?
Champagne please.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Did you love him?
Yes.  Very much.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
So.  The final countdown.
The final countdown.
What...?
I'm sorry.
Ellie, what is it?
I can't do this --
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
They don't believe me.
Oh my God...
Git your shovel and git to work.
But I made this arrangement --
I'll make it a dollar.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
What are you doin' here?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Tell us about it.
Comin' out here, Boss?
I don't know, Boss.
Please! Please!
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Go git it, Luke.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
You can't do that!
Whatcha got?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Lemme see it!
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Whatta you so happy about?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
But, Luke...
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
Like I always do?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
You just said he could eat anything.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
That fool. That damn fool.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
He'll never make it.
I hate this...
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
What pattern was that?
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
When was that?
The door was already open...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
You know I can't do that.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You know where.
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
Because of your phone calls.
Is it an ongoing case?
How do you know that?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
We've got another one.
But it's a different m.o.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
Why should I trust you?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes.  I have to go...
Don't hang up!
Is there a phone booth there?
He was in my apartment!
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
I heard. Good police work.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Absolutely.
Where you going?
What the hell you need her for?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
There, that's better.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
It's about time.
Do you find him attractive?
I thought that was you, up there.
I'd like to go back. James...
You haven't told me where we're going.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Can you drive?
Crash victim?
I did this already.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Just go ahead and tell us.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about this one?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
You did the right thing.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Are you sure, Dear?
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Must you walk so quickly?
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Letty, you should be in bed.
A while, I guess.
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
You took bets on my diagnosis?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
But you're checking it out.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess which hand.
Really, this isn't funny.
For a price.
Good God.
Don't be ridiculous.
A daisy for the lady.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
I have a terrible confession.
Tell the doctor.
Then it's over.
Do you?
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Well?
So there were no problems?
Yeah.
I better make a list.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Wow.
Do you like it?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Hey.
Michael.
This must be Beast.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
The store was busy.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Aunt Lily?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Michael, take it easy.
I sure know what that feels like.
Well then why'd it happen?
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
What are we going to do?
Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
What are you doing?
I'm going to the store.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
Especially this last year.
No, you've done a perfect job.
No, no.
It doesn't matter who.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
All tapped out.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Do you know who this is?
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Where did they go?
Hello?
It's Elvis...
Who?
It's me...
You're there now?
Hello?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Okay.   How much?
I'm not here to negotiate.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
They're gonna be what?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
I guess we're going to find out.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Why is everything an argument with you?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
No.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
Hadley --
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
You haven't answered my question.
I will.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
What do you want now?
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
Why haven't you turned us in?
How much?
Yeah?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
They were all French guys.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Everything.
Everything?
Just find them!
Good song though.
The Holiday Hotel.
They don't have a wine list.
What about transportation?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
They don't serve wine here.
We've got to get out of here.
I'll drive.
I knew I should have driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
-- I want to be Elvis.
God, I want to go home.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
The money isn't here.
J&amp;B?
What does arresting us get them?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
Who are you waiting for?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
What's this?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I don't care about your sword.
Where's your master?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
I've missed you.
How so?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Here you must be in proper attire.
Come and get it if you can.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
Give it back!
Kneel!
Lo?
Let's stop a moment.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give me back my comb.
Let them look.
Go.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
It has.  How's business?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Have you questioned him yet?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
I knew she would intrigue you.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
And you're gonna tell me who.
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's only a flesh wound.
They couldn't do anything for me.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
At least it finally stopped raining.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Who?
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
Well, how's your friend?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Do you know what you destroyed?
Cute nickname, don't you think?
Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Shelly?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
18k.  Crap.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
We've got company.
No shooting.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Are you okay?
Excuse me?
I have his journal.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
You promise not to say anything?
No.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
I sincerely doubt it.
How's the water?
I never said that.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
You're naked.
No thank you.
How are you today?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
How about tonight?
I'm busy.
I'm... I'm alright.
What are you reading?
Of Human Bondage.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Oh please.
I do not.
Am I bothering you?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
That's not fair.
I just came to say goodbye.
Please don't go.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you saying?
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
Schwarz. Jewish?
Greg McConnell.
I don't think that bothered him.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Do you want to learn or not?
Well do you like him?
You'd do that for me?
Who is it?
Something awful happened last night.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Why didn't you do something?
No.
What do I do then?
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
It's like a secret society.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
But I thought high school is only four years.
You think he'll like it?
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I want to go home.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
You think?
Is it me?
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
Want a blow job?
Good night Cecile.
My daughter, Rachel.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Hi, mom.
Oh baby... oh baby...
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
She bought it.
Is she with you?
No.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Ronald?
Yeah?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Fuck her yet?
Loser.
Blow me.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Moving along quite well.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
What's your problem?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
She shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Tell me all the details.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Some other time.
I'm not in the mood.
And that's why you're leaving?
It clearly is why.
I want to fuck.
No, I'm not.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Why so nervous?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
Get off me!
Will you calm down?
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
It's Cecile.
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
I've already told you, she's not home.
What do you want?
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
It's really important.
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
What time is it?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
What are you talking about?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
Mommy --
Did you ever make a wish?
Oh, lots of times.
But where did you get it, Amy?
The Farren house
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
She was very pretty.
What's her name?
Irena.
Where is everybody?
Something's haywire,
I'm never unfair.
Ollie.
What?
I haven't had my breakfast.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Yes, daddy.
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
But wishes don't come true.
And who did the voice belong to?
These are all from me.
Daddy!
In the garden? Would she be there now?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?
What'd you get for Christmas?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where is that?
I can not tell you.
For as long as you'll let me.
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
You mustn't be afraid.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Yes, Amy.
Look at my ring.
That's a fine-looking ring.
Will you come soon?
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Hurry, hurry.
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
And Amy mailed them?
I like to see her happy.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Wow your body's really hot.
There was a sale.
I mean where on your body?
How's the rest of your health?
Jennifer?
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Do you really need these?
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
So did you do it?
Did I kill him? Of course not!
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
At least your PMS is over.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
What did he say?
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
So where's this infamous arm now?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Get rid of him!
Holy shit, I don't know.
DON'T call the police.
What? Why'd you do that?
Why the fuck would you do that?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
You expecting someone?
No.
I think I just got my period.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
Fall in love.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I think George knows.
About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Hello?
I know.
So you're Grant's secretary?
You hungry?
Well, whattdaya think?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
They say sex is great for cramps.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
I didn't have to pee then.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Look what you did!
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
On your desk.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
You busted me.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
My mom used to get PMS too.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
No. I was doing my laundry.
Was there anything in that washer?
Except Mark of course.
You didn't say it.
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
Here's a towel.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
You got a dog?
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
Take some allergy medicine.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
See he was cheating from the get go.
He was found a few blocks away.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
He means the last that we know of.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
And that was 28 days ago today.
I need something to keep me awake.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Sell maps?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
The other one?
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
Police.  Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
Doctor!  What brings you here?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
In there.
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Dammit!
Iím your new assistant.
You typed this report?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
Where are we going?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
People...  after me.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Where do you think this goes?
Look!  This is a good one!
What is that door?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
No.  I, ah...
Someoneís after me.
Then we must call the police.
Donít kill me!
Shut up!
Your name is John White.
Bad dreams?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I'm nothing then.
What are you doing?
You're a liar!
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Don't say a .
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Is this dangerous or anything?
They barely talk anymore.
What's with her?
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I'm not certain about...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
.. Nothing.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
TilT we figure something out.
A condition...
We think so.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Clean.
Check his kids.
Uh, let me get back to you...
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to kill him.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
I'll lock him away for good.
What do you mean by that?
Just what you think I mean.
Are you threatening me?
I was gonna do something with Joan.
They could put you in jail.
I don't think so
This is undeclared income.
The government
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
That'd be great.
Will he be alright?
No.
I'm afraid so.
In the car.
A teleprompter.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
President vetoes works bill?
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
What do you mean you made it all up?
Wrong...
`Dave'?
And it's proving quite effective...
Does it make the cars any better?
Fertility beads.
They re not my attack dogs.
What do you mean?
... Sometimes they do.
How'd you get started?
You're not?
I can't say.
You got a gun?
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
`Bleed for your king.'
You're kidding.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Who?
Well...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
You bet.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
You sure this goes somewhere?
I don't mind.
Are you hungry?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
You find people jobs?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What?
I can't.
Hi.
I never thought I'd...
I know.
I missed...
So this is it?
It could be fun.
We're all set,  sir.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
All set.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
What is it?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Datura.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
He is dying. He knows it.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Tricks...Jesus...
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Sounds boring to me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Charlie Dalton.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Women swoon!
Yeah.
Well?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Oh God, it's over now!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
I think he's sweet.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Who's in?
Charlie...
No.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
This is stupid.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
It does?  What?
Don't stop.
Stop what?
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.
So, uh, where are you in school?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
What is that?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Very good, Mr._?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
A yawp?
Again!  Louder!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
All right!  What'd she say?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Where are you going?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I'm sorry, Neil.
But father, it's not fair.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Look at this.
What is it?
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.
What?
Want to come to the study group?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I've found it.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Oh..
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I'll come to the performance.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Put more into it!
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
Who are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
And no questions asked.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Not an option.
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Did you clear this?
Who gives a shit about aft?
I'm not staying here!
What other bunch?
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
Noooo!
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
You people...rich people...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Anti social?
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
The "come back" kind.
You're saying they can think?
What's the matter?
What is it?
Finnegan...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
I don't take orders at all.
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Can we use our indoor voice please...
It's okay...come on...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Or maybe not.
Why don't you back off?
Maybe plans changed...
What was that?
Nothing.
Someone's back there.
What is it man?
She fucked you?
She fucked me.
She fucked me too.
She fucked you?
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
I'll get the boots.
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
We're all going.
Here's to huntin'.
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
They did not!
They did too!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
What the --!
Tell him, Vince!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
That's new, isn't it?
Whee-uu!
Married?
You're back.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Sure. Why not.
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
I have to go.
No, I --
But I insist.
I have to go.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
I came to see Merle.
You are his friend.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
She's in back.
Thanks.
How was huntin'?
Oh. Fine.
Get anything?
No.
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
Where's it gone?
Not so good.
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Here.
You Biederman?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda, what's the matter?
Linda, Linda...!
Okay.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Nick?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
You're going hunting?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Playing?
We... Three bullets.
Who the hell is he?
You can do it, Sal.
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
I know.
So do I.
You do?
Yeah... I guess.
What'd he say?
Pow.
Pow?
Pow.
Hell no!
From Nam?
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
I thought you might be praying.
Forget Sal.
How many bullets?
Three bullets -- minimum.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Here, here! This is it!
Watch it, shithead!
No.
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle. You know that? You're one fucking bastard!
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What?
What's that noise?
Great. Hey. That's great.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Where?
Well, who'd you get married to?
No.
No!
The fuck I did!!!
Up.
Down.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Yeah?
What did you say?
Who is it?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Funny guy.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Hello Wade.
I want to stop aging.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
You okay?
You sure?  I can help you.
Nobody's looking.
Not the 'T' word.
I'm ready.
They're going to rob that bank.
How do you know?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
She's pretty.
You need anything else?
I'll be okay.
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
What else did he get?
How ya feeling?
How do I look?
I'm here.
You treat her nice.
You okay?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
I just heard.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
You should be in hospital.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Demolition Man.
You never want to find out.
You all right?
Yeah.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
This little thing says I can't.
You could always take it off.
Belle --
Gee -- that Fair --
Young man -- you got me there.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Howdy, Jabez.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
You're not -- Dorothy.
No. She's gone.
No, Stone!
No, you're not.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
You are afraid!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
You know darn well it is.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
But -- I was just lucky.
Jabez -- help!
Oh, Jabez.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary -- it's gone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
We must go on home, Jabez.
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary --
I'll get it, Jabez.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I am going to lock him up.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Why don't they come --
Jabez!
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Helps sometimes to say it.
What's ailing that dog?
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
My son ... what's the matter?
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Mary -- Jabez --
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
I want someone to talk to ...
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
It's okay, it's okay.
But meant her moving here.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
One of yours?
The police...?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Bad for your health anyway.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you're an American?
Hans.  Your Hans.
I'm going to count to three...
Three down, four to go --
Oh...Where does he live?
Holly Gennero?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al?  Al, you there?
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Is that him?
Jesus, you're the man!
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Hey, don't take the car!
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Hello, Sonny.
How are you doing?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well.... huh ...
So... that sure is something.
You're crazy.
That's it.
You're really crazy.
I know!
Denmark?  Sweden?
So!  Sal is with you?
I know I am.  I know!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
I don't have a choice.
Look... who's on the phone?
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah.
Well, then...
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
I got Sal.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Call me Sonny-boy.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
You frisk me.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
Okay, what do you give me?
What do you want?
You tryin' to fuck me?
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Hey... let him out!
Okay, is the vault open?
What's the matter with you?
Howard, give him the keys...
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
What if I take you with me?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Special to me, too.
You like me?
Sure - we like you.
Yeah.
Why not?
Mister Mulvaney?
You got Bank Americard?
What is it, Sam?
Thanks again, Sam.
I didn't eat any pizza.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You were terrific, too!
No, not until after they killed him.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
Ah, Jesus...
Where's the money?
It's the cops.  Shit!
You mean that?
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
He wants one.
Dead or alive?
All right ... send them the guard.
We'd kill ourselves.
Does that still go?
Sonny -
Okay, Sonny.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want them all.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
I don't want him.
What can he do, he's clean...
Okay - you got your one.
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
I am.
What are you trying to pull?
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Not now, Mom, please.
Doing what?
How much?
Morning.
Who the hell is that?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Did it hurt?
Hello?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
That's the rumor on the street.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Is that you, Domino?
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Cunt.
Stop it.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
God help us. God help us all.
Really? Did you play in a band?
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Cool it, Choco.
No. What's the big deal?
What did he say about the arm?
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
You were good.
How you be?
I be.  I'm living large.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I don't like anything else.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
Ya back is got.
My brother.
Yo!
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Don't come back, either.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
Mookie.
You the man.
You the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
No!
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Where did you sleep?
Mookie.
Gotta go.
That's it?
Eddie Lovell.
What makes Sammy run?
My name is Eddie.
Fifty cents.
Jade.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
I'm coming.
No.
Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
I'm getting paid...
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D, not C.
How many you say?
WAKE UP!
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Let it be broke.
Can ya dig it?
ML?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
C'mon, Sal.
Do we now?
Keep it.
You keep it.
It's supposed to be even hotter today.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Mookie?
Gotta go.
I work too, but I still make time.
Hot.  Hot.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can run out and get it.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
Meda.  Meda.
Where are you going?
Tina, I'll be right back.
Just coolin'.
Smack him back.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
That's what you think?
I'll do that.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
I was going to buy a slice.
I'm listening.
I love you, my brother.
Get the broom.
Sez who?
I know this.
I love you.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Mookie's OK.
I know.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Then we could try something else.
Pop asked you.
Take it easy, Pop.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Depends how you define 'new'...
Hey guys.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Excuse me?
O'clock?
Yeah...
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Just down the hall.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What?
Okay.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
Home school. Til today.
I think it's just over there.
Is that what I think it is?
What?
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Who's Principal Collins?
The principal.
H A R R Y...
The second R is silent.
Got any crazy eights?
Peg leg?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I will stop this car right now.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
I didn't know that.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Nice jugs.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Nope. I was right.
Sucks for you.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I kinda screwed things up.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
I don't think so.
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
But-
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
No one knows?
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
A raft.
George Washington!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You certainly did.
I know I did.
You're it.
Am not.
Are, too.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
But my mom gave me the map.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
The one on the left.
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
Sorry, Charlie.
That's gross.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
I'm so close I can feel it.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
You really are a pirate.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
How much homework is there?
Do we have a deal?
He passed away three years ago.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Hey you two. Lights out.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Have you got what I want?
You know I do!
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
I am strong!
God, I've missed you.
You said "aloha" twice.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And, take some more pictures.
Wow, you are smart.
Knock knock.
What?
Oh, just like the President.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
My Lord!
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
My thanks.
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Basically...
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I'm sorry Gurney.
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Remove her gag!
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Man-carved steps.
Always?
We call that one Muad'dib.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
It burns.
Did they try and fail?
... Many men have tried.
Did they try and fail?
Those sounds could be imitated.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Are you sure this is okay?
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Bela, what happened?!
Let me take you to the hospital.
Should I call a doctor?
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
So how'd we do?
Bela, are you ready?
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Eddie, you screwed up.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Don't let me slow you down.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why are you here??
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about killing myself.
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
And, cut...
Last night was quite a romp.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
You mean a Tesla coil?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Rolling.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
This is kind of a stream--
And who may you be?
I guessed.
Will he be okay?
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Boris Karloff!?
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
It takes me comfortable.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Mr. Wood?!
Would that work?
Mr. Reynolds!
Could we moovf to table?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Tor, I should be getting home.
What is happening?
Excuse me, Sir...?
Is there a script?
Lugosi?
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
OUR picture?
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
The marriage already ended.
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, hi.
You look beat.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I just picked them up on the way over...
Oh.  Okay.
Stop!
What was that?
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
The poor girl's out of a job.
Who's Dr. Tom?
I can't get it to go up.
Let's get married.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
What's uncanny?
Yes!
You're <u>sure</u>???
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
What if--you're vomiting?
What if I'm vomiting?
How's your mother?
I'm moving out.
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
What if Shari's the dream?
Mr. Pekurny.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Who?
You said that.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Eddie? ...
Are the TV people with you?
Hey, he cheated on her.
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Both.
He had girlfriends!
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
Eddie...
Oh God. What hospital?
The doctor said you were having sex.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Hi, Mom. 
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Our what?
Are you asking me?
How much less?
Hey, Lou.
Dynamite.
Ha!
Really?
Oh my God.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Um...
I know, I ...
Shari, I really like you...
I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Really? 
I'm sorry.
Where?
Okay.
It's not their fault.
What's up?
Show business.
You're in show business?
I'm making a tape.
I got your message. Way to go!
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Who is it?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
You brought the cameras here!
... Ray?
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
Good-bye, brother!
Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
What...
That girl's an idiot.
Hi.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Good?
Ohhh...
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Yo --
pierdo.
Tu
pierdes.
El/ella -
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Dick... Dick,..
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Larry?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
I know.
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that's super
Looks good to me.
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Hello, Mr. M.
So what brings you here?
Plenty of pep, too.
So Tracy?
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
You'll be fine.
I hope so
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
This weekend.
Door was open.
I don't believe you.
Here?
More this way.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Okay, let's say
Where 're you going?
Are you crazy?
I don't care.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
For what?
I mean at you.
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
Yeah.
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
You dumbshit!
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
How's the left these days?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Somebody hit you?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
Do you enjoy it?
I'm not sure.
So you saved her.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
Call me Dudley.
Will you work for me?
Of course... But how?
Give me one minute.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Was it... a rat?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Why?
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Ellis Loew.
She's fine.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
Thanks, but no thanks.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
Clean?
Anything?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Man, what're you saying?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
But you were business associates?
And?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Ed, I want confessions.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
You're the key witness?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
What?
I need to speak to you.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You make a mistake?
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
You sound like you mean it.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
On what evidence?
Officer White?
A sweet man.
My daughter was a virgin!
You're back, boychick.
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Shut up!
I just called it.
And no one'll know about this?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
DePinto's dead.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
You've got it on tape?
Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
When can you get it here?
I'm doing a transfer now.
I'll come straight there.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
The NSA?
Yes.
Okay.
What <u>is</u> that?
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
And you won't. Now move--
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
Did you call anyone?
What do you mean?
I mean did you call anyone.
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
How do you know so much?
What do you think?
Looks like Detroit.
That is one ugly sunrise.
The NSA killed him.
What's going on?
They're here.
Who?
Them.
Here?
Gimme that.
You sure?
You're driving.
We lost 'em.
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
No he won't.
What if--
Reynolds.
No.
Feeling lucky?
Baudmore Consultants.
Is Jerry Delsano in?
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Can you help me?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Is that good?
I'll say.
What size?
Pardon?
What size?
Thanks.
Remain calm.
I think she'll like this very much.
That's my point.
Your stuff?
A report?
A police report.
About what?
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
What kind of trouble.
You tell me.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
I'm not his attorney.
Than why can't you tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Somebody took my blender.
No.
Anything at all?
No, sir.
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
To buy lingerie.
Uh-oh.
I saw a man die.
Bobby?
Who did you work with to get the--
No.
Sorry.
Well, you know--
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Does that hurt?
Well...yeah.
Good.
You opened the thing?
The lingerie.
That was for Christmas.
What is it?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
That ain't me.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
How's the trout?
Do you like fish?
DePinto?
Brill.
Brill?
Other than Brill.
Other than me.
Thank you.
You being audited?
For the last four years.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Rachel--
We're screwed.
I can't.
You have to.
I've never met him?
I <u>did</u> care how.
I'm sorry about that.
He didn't.
We believe he did.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
--otherwise we may have to--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
My shoe?
Seat 74.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Robert--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Some of 'em.
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
He's kidding.
Where's mom?
Do I know you?
Alright!
The blender?
I love my blender.
They didn't take the silverware?
They only took electrical appliances.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
Christ!
Ssh!
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Bobby--
Why would they--
I don't know. I mean--
Why would the NSA--
I don't know!
Jerry--
Listen to me.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
I have a family.
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Jerry?
Yeah?
I need help.
Are you still in Crystal City?
He got hit by a bus.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
We'd have to--
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
You're kidding me.
No sir.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
What about--
We don't know.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
Puffed cheese?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
Now is that clear?
How much did you pay?
Which stall?
I don't want to go back.
I don't care to bargain.
Actually, you sing.
You sing.  All the time.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
What am I looking at?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Do they know them?
Will you please come in?
You sew very badly.
What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
This is - what is this?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Shall we be all right?
Dance with me.
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Yes.  Absolutely.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
Safe journey.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
How are you?
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
David Caravaggio.
Is this you?
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
Or was it Toronto?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Are you Hana?
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where've you been?
Who are his ghosts?
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Irving Berlin.
Have a drink.
What did you say?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Right.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Are you asleep?
I can already see.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
He needn't disturb you.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
I'll probably marry him.
Why?  Is he staying?
I've been told that before.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Hey! -
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
I've met you before.
For my hair?
So I follow the wires?
No. But he hands them over.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
Of course.  When?
I mean home.  India.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
He's gone, hasn't he?
No.  He's - no.
Hello.
Whoa - give me a chance!
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
You've got a mustache.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Go away.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
This is wonderful!
This was your garden?
Or my wife's.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Through a window.
You ordering chop suey again?
We've got to catch him in the act.
We're getting close.
I don't know, but close.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
I have a question...
Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?
No you can't.
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
You have a car?
Seems I am.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
But Roki said--
You can't.
We going somewhere?
Maybe I should drive this time.
Very nice.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's a test.
It's a fake.
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
I'm a thief. Sue me.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
You're late.
And good morning.
Good morning.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Got it.
Thank you.
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
One, two, three...
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Ready?
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
Okay, you're a thief.
It's your mistake.
The big job.
What?
Your share.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Oh my god, I thought--
Well...What are we doing?
That's where the Mask comes in.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Charged.
No way to take another day or two?
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
That was a lifetime ago.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Relax, don't jam it...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The disc is still in there.
The door's the only way out!
Come on.
No way.
Hang on.
You gave them the eight billion.
Which is--
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
This is big enough.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Remind me why.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You damn well thought wrong.
Tonight your league night?
This is just show and tell.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She's calling the shots now.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
See you.
Probably not.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What the hell is this doing here?
All of 'em?
Which one?
There's more than one?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Cause of the chromium.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
The judge came up with a number.
Five million dollars?
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
You're a girl.
Course I did.
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
Is that what I think it is?
No shit.
I like this case.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
Whoa.  No shit.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Not in my world.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Fuck Kurt.
I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
You see your office?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
What is that?
Who's the judge?
Corey.
Did he say why?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
You come to the right place.
You're married.
What kind of chromium is it?
Mommy, can I get a flower?
I don't know.
What's going on in there?
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
We'll see.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Annabelle Daniels.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
You want my number?
Which number do you want, George?
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What're you doing?
What are you doing here?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
That's Ed.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
About this.
More than you need me.
Thank you.
I'm embarrassed.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Where's my paycheck?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You're moving away?  When?
Next week.
Dr. Paulsen?
It was .... the Emperor ....
My lord.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
The boy is our last hope.
You must survive, Luke.
... Luke, you must not go.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Well, it's been awhile.
Barks his concern.
Barks at his master.
... the power?
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Sir, I was wondering ...
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
We?
Yes.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
What is it?
You don't look angry.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Stop that.
I do not!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
That depends.  Where are we?
Who's staring?
You look silly.
You look great.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
No hard feelings?
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
Luke!
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
The deflector shields are gone.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Closer?!
What??
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
This hyperdrive had better work.
I have followed my feelings.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
I don't believe it.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
Free your mind and return he will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
I'll die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
It won't get through the blockade.
Good God.
And we can watch ...
Go easy, Stevie.
They look pretty docile.
Please
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You told me he was dead.
Oh Cuervo...
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
All right, so I made another deal.
Dream on, blue eye.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
What's the little black box do?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Not you?
No.
She's in the green.
Lock fuel rods.
Getting ready to invade.
Stop the damn car.
No way.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Me too?
I don't know about this thing.
What're you doing in here?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
No screamin' shit.
You need help.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Well, I'll think it over.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
I'm looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
All of us?
Yield. I have the advantage.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
You saved me from the arrow...
But not from your destiny.
I want to thank you.
How? Where?
In the great book.
What?!
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Father...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
I left it in the tent, sir.
Who does it serve?
No.
There is one.
Who?!
You.
The law forbids it.
Why didn't he kill us?
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
They do.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
The oath. You didn't say--
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Hello?
Oh great, anything else?
What didn't he tell you?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
What is it?
Phonograph.
I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
May I ask...?
Not that I know of.
Oh, I see.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
No. No rats.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Miss?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
How are you today?
Fine thank you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Why the math?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Chris MacNeil?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Sure did.
He didn't mention?
He didn't mention her.
That depends.
On what?
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Wanna drink.
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
Um........Stuff.
Oh look at that.
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
Yeah.
You know how?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
Captain Howdy.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Oh I bet he is.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Regan, why are you reading that?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
I don't want it.
Hi Chris. Great party.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
Goodnight Dims.
I came to say goodbye.
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
What's playing.
Withering Heights.
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
It would bring us together.
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Bon Jour.
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Uoy era ohw.
I'm all right.
Oh really, when?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
What is it?
Can you give her something?
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
MERRIN!!!!!!!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Fuck him!!!
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Miss?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Sometimes.
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
No.
Why not?
You're not going to drive.
Give me the keys!
You're not going to drive!
It's my goddamn car!
It's our goddamn car!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Yeah, come on in.
Little slow tonight.
What's this?
What about tomorrow?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Trunks?
Swimming trunks.
We have some lotion.
Just the same.
Well, look at this.
Beasley.
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
No bones?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
Two at a time?
Oh my God ...
What's the gig?
That's not the point.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Frank.
Don't make trouble, all right?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Count it.
Huh?
Count it.
I hate your kids, Frank.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
What d'ya got?,
What do you think?
You look awful.
Thanks.
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
So do I.
This time you gotta go.
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
I made her nervous.
What do you mean?
What's with Charlie?
Yeah?
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
We don't get a gig.
Nice, huh?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No?
A gust of wind killed him.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
That's what we agreed.
Let's get it over with.
You're getting cold feet about this.
What's the matter?
Get out of here.
Come on, stand still.
Get out of here!
It's not gonna hurt you.
No.
See anything?
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You all right?
Hey, Frank.
You recognized me.
Just a lucky guess.
First night?
Day.  Wednesday.
Last?
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Unless you want the right.
All night?
Yeah.  You mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
How dare you say you love me.
How's it coming?
Two hours ago!
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
You saw wrong.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
What're you doing down here?
Celebrating.  Join me?
Couple years.
February?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
The tenth's out.
I can't make the tenth.
What's it for?
What disease?
What channels it on?
Jack, you're on television.
Go ahead.
I'll take the Mallory.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Charlie called.
Spur of the moment.
So what'd you think?
No, no.  You boys are tired.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick?  How sick?
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Yes, it is.
This where the auditions are?
What do you mean?
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
We ran long.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
I sing now?
When?
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
Where's my name?
Where's your dress?
Do I look like I'm naked?
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
It's orange!
Come on.
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine!
What do you think?
Shoes?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Right.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
I said I was sorry.
Give me that.
Virgins.
Go ahead.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Hey, we're connected.
Great.
Peggy Lee?
Hey, will you look at that?
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Got another song for us?
Yes, well, they are.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Gotta go.
How come?
Funny hours.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Right.  Bring him back.
He doesn't bite.
Baker.
All right.  Hold on.
It went well tonight.
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
You miss him, don't you?
You never sang before?
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
It's okay.  Last one.
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
Guess I got a little scattered.
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
What'd I say?
Nothing.
You're upset.
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
You were good.
Nina?
Who's Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
Long story.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Look, if you want to leave...
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
So how's the cat food business?
What kind?
Huh?
Jack.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Guess they're up.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Ivory.
Looks old.
What's a prom?
How'd the show go?
Jack.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
John.  It's good to see you.
So. How are you?
Fine.  You?
Big piece or little?
Huh? Oh, no.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
What did he do?
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
Perfect fit.
Pollux ...
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
We need to talk.
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Must've been after we got engaged.
No.
I took it from my fake husband.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Would it?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
-- Castor?
What -- what are you doing?
Jamie ...
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
I won't tell mom if you don't.
You mean like ... condoms?
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
That's your name, isn't it?
You've got someone in your office.
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
I'm just having some fun.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What do you know about it?
What is with you tonight?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Oh, that Karl.
I'll deal with her later.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Her assistant?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
That’s right. And auto supply...
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
We’re almost done here...
Where’s my real dad?
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Where do I go now?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Is it...?
I don’t think so.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Like the dress...?
Something like that.
Need a nurse?
Are we...?
Are we finally being honest?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
Where were you?
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because that’s where I live.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Here you go...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Maybe I should wait...
And now...?
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
Think bigger.
This place is a perk, Kate.
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
I promise, Jack...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Not with what they pay me...
You’re not married, are you?
You can’t go!
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Where is he?
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Hey, are you okay?
Of course I did.
I want to see you again.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
I can't take this.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
I had it at four.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
You're hot!
I though we went over this.
Not this again --
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
I'm driving.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Leonard, how's the feed?
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this.
Feeling better?
Which was?
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
What?  What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
And reverse the mutations --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I can...make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
The less time, the better.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Just one, General...
Listen...the Heart.
Doctor...
We're pushing oxygen today.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
What can we do?
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
What's that?
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You have no right to blame Duval --
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I can't tell you.
May I?
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
How's it look?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Then don't drift down further.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
I don't know. Few munce.
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
...Blood has been shed.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Three people. In Brainerd.
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
GOT IT?
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, he's adorable.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
How ya doin'?
Mr. Mohra?
Officer Olson.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Uh-huh... A what?
Uh-huh.
In what way?
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Can you be any more specific?
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
Yah.
Mr. Lundegaard?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Hon? Got the growshries.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, real good.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Well... yah.

Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah.

You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
You're darned tootin'!

Well, I don't vouch for him.
Well, that's okay, I just -
Where is everybody?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
...Well, that passed.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.

His wife?

No.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
And this guy is...
Gustafson's accountant.

Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.

Copy. Yah, send me back-up!

Yah.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
They announced it?
...So?
Three-cent stamp.
Your mallard?
Yah.
Yah, I guess.
I love you, Margie.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
This is do-able.
He's at Norstar.
That wouldn't interest you.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
You are?!
Is that your blood?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
No, I wasn't aware...
Does this sound strange to you?
The dynamite...
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
Who do you think could've done this?
You need to lighten up.
Can't you give me something?
I'll expose you.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
That's the idea -- we split them.
Really?
It's for men.
This could go on for hours.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
It's time for you to leave.
Where?  Here?
Here.
There?
Here.
Here.
Make sure.
You feel nothing?
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
Chloe's dead.
When?
Do you care?
You hear that?
Hear what?
... A person.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
We did make love?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What did you say... ?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
What happened... ?
Hello?
Who's this?
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
How have you been?
Is this a test, sir?
Who do you think I am?
What do you do, Tyler?
What do you want me to do?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Being clever.
I guess so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
A hotel?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Go ahead.  Say it.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
But a good strange.
Call what off?
The fight.
What fight?
Anyone?
Where's your car?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
Good answer.
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Okay.
Promise you won't.
Yes, I promise.
I said I promise!
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
You get rid of her.
What is this place?
We don't need him...
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Fucking sweet.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
This conversation...
... is over.
You're too young.  Sorry.
Four in Milwaukee.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Why did you do that?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I'm going to...
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Tyler...
What?
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
Paraffin.
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Not exactly according to plan.
Why... why... why... ?
Why are you doing this?!
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What are you doing?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
What?
What?
Look at me...
Who is this?
Very good, Sir.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
Ain't that something?
You're welcome to join our club.
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Biology, mostly.
Would you rather be dead?
No!  It can't be.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
Maybe.  What's this about?
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
You mean Alex Browning.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
This is cheery.
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Want me to drive?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
Mom?
No.
Most kids do, I guess.
Stop the car!
Can't you open the door?!
You know what to do.
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
I'm sorry we broke in.
It broke!
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Wow!
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Gettin' old, huh?
Show me how it operates.
You read me, Brewer?
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
How you doing, Brewer?
Roundeye.
Gawd, you look awful.
Where did you find this clown?
Spooks?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
I do?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I know.  I go with you.
Yes you can.
John.  My name is John.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Where?
Not yet.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
What?
About 22 hours on site.
It's not necessary.
I know...
American.  Come to get you out.
Hello, John.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
What?
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Most men are.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I was attacked.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
No, I'm fine... really...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Can I have my desk please.
The moron?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
What does that mean?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
My agent.  I called my agent.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Where you comin' from?!
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Remember. One chorus and out.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Yes... I... I agree...
Fine.  I'll say no.
No, I have to work.
How un-sixties of you.
Hello Lydia?
Free?
Oh, Lydia!
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
They're --  -- What?
Where -- ?
<u>What</u>!?
The Little People?
They said you're The One.
I'm the one what?
... Do you know who I am?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
The Little...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Do you follow her every day?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
But I gave it to you!
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
SAW WHO!!?
It's such a great song.
Who are you talking to Jack?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Holdin' my penis...
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
You advise us!
Are you all right?
Parry Parry?
No just Parry.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
You don't have to say that.
You're married.
No.
Divorced.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
You're not going to play it again.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Cerveza.
You can sing the song.
I did, didn' I, El?
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm going on over there...
I'm not some piece a crap.
I know you're not.
You like it?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Rayette.
What?
Sure you don't want anything?
What's your name?
Wasn't it, ladies?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
What?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
What?
With applesauce?
Where is she, anyway?
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You were going without saying goodbye?
But what about me?
Bye, now.
Yes, intentionally.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
The day after tomorrow.
If you're free.
You don't call that music, though.
I didn't have any.
You think I'm a fake.
I think it's what you think.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
That's right.
That's what you said?
Robert?
I have to talk to you.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
That's three games to none, Carl.
I don't think that's true.
It is true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Don't call me "honey," mack.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Well, she was.
Miss Dupea.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Fine.
Look at me.
Why you have an attitude for?
Who are you?
Victor.
What?
Wussup?
Yo.
Remember me, from the pool?
So watcha doin'?
I, umm, came to see you.
You know somebody around here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
Of course.
A play-ya.
Just chill.
I buy them flowers.
How you treat them?
I kissed those girls.
Come down!
Wussup?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
I got punished, man.
Where you goin'?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
Yeah.
A girl named Amanda.
Positive.
You sure?
So what do you want with her anyway?
I'm a good friend of hers.
What?
Not really.
Hey!
Where you know Amanda from?
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
Maybe tonight?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
Hey you're really nuts.
They didn't do anything.
What? What are you talking about?
Fletch.
Full name.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
My God, you're serious.
Not a prayer.
Greetings, everyone.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
So where do you know Alan from?
We play tennis at the club.
That's Babar.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
Right.
Well, which one?
Margaret.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Oh, he was dying for years.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
No idea.
No idea at all?
Okay. Some idea.
Like when?
Like tonight.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
I'm serious, Sam.
Nothing. They're still there.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Here you are, Doctor.
That's it?
I guess not.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Read this, please.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
They busted me last week.
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Do you have a passport?
Where am I going?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I wonder if that's his doctor.
My hero.
Cute young thing, too.
She's cute as a button.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John who?
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
That's a strange combination.
Why do you keep doing this?
You are a rich woman.
Who is it?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
I ordered lunch.
I mean put clothes on.
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
I saved his life during the war.
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks for the great time.
What is this?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
What are you talking about?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Cabana one.
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Muchas gracias.
Lock's busted.
Where is she?
Moved out.
I'm her cousin.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Two...
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
So let's go! We run the pictures.
How gray?
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Fletch, you want an apology?
Not really.
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Actually, you may take it all now.
Who?
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You going to be okay?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Contacts.
I don't know, what was the case?
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
How much?
Hey, they blew me.
It's red, Ford.
You okay?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ford, you were right!
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Are you okay?
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
I tried to help you...!
And hey, I appreciate it...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
Fine!
What's fine?
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Let me go out like a man.
Well, hello, Ford.
Jazz, we're talking here.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You'd said something about proof...
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
Hi, private eye guy!
What's my name?
Doyle.
What?
I'm clean.
No - no.
How's everything?
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
B.O.C.A.
Got a wife named Angie.
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Sal --
What's your name, asshole?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
Allo... Salvatore...
Twelve o'clock... yes...
It's your problem.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Le sommes nous?
Are you sure it is dead?
Sale boulot.
Il fallait le faire.
What happens to the schedule?
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
Where from?
Des Moines.
Where's he from?
Marseilles.
That's in France.
You want some eggs.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
Drink this.
Who is that guy?
Give who a tail?
Popeye.
Why not?
Timezit?
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
What is that old building?
What was it?
It was a crematorium.
For garbage?
You remember Mary Finelli?
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you, Bud.
I'm off.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'm serious.
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
You ready?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What'd you just say?
What?
What's going on?
Oh my god.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
What are you talking about?
I lost you.
Why?
Fire.
When?
Chief?!  Is that you?
Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
What are we like in...1998?
You really wanna know?
John, you still there?
You all right?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
How you feeling?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
You're not looking too good.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Uh, huh.
Got a minute?
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
So how'd you like LION KING?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You work too hard, John.
Are you a good cop, John?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
You used to be on the job?
I look familiar?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
Where are you going?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
No more... I can't!
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
What was that?
Think you can figure it out?
I vote for me.
I'm a slow eater.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
What's this?
Your bed.
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I don't know.
What?
Did you stay here last night?
Somebody was in here.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
It's deceiving.
What happened that night?
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
You're Shelly?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
Yes.
I don't see anything.
This is no time to celebrate!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
I have to.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
I never said you were "nothing".
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Is that all you found?
Whaddya mean?
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
No.
Why?
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
You mean you had a bad dream.
Are they grown-ups?
Which is?
Boy scouting.
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
Steven...
Anything else?
I know who you are.
I need to talk to you.
No, I --
Twenty.
You need to leave.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Everything going okay?
It's going.
Legs giving you trouble?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
What's the problem here?
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Okay.
Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.
Tell me.
She's beautiful.
Her name's Stephanie.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Until I hear the truth.
I know what it sounds like.
You don't know shit!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
About what?
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
Time to check out the waiters.
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
Did you hear that?
And you'll never do it again.
Where's the radio?
What's that?
Jason's here in New York.
Where did you get that alcohol?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
What did you do with Rennie??
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
What a beautiful day.
I can't swim.
What is your location?
Rennie...
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
I used to drive a taxi.
I opened thousands of brains.
What did you find?
Crosstown.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Say it again.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
She wants a divorce.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Very dangerous.
We must abandon.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
Is it safe?
I think we Nought to wait.
I say we go.
You say we go?
I'm not ready.
Where are you going?
Don't wait Efor me.
It's your best play, Nicky.
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
Had to be him.
Great game.
Unbelievable.
What are you talking about?
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Does what feel comfortable?
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She's dying.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
What?
This is how we've managed to last.
We're able to surprise each other.
It's your best play, Nicky.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
That's completely crazy.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
Why won't you tell me your name?
What else?
Packs an emotional wallop.
What else?
What do we want?
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
All right. What's been going on?
That's always been my problem.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I am really, deeply sorry.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
Washed away.
What did it say?
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Who is it?
I'm at the door.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Pop, will you let me in?
Where the hell are you?
What do you want?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Since when did that matter?
Let's not start that again.
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
Now that's a complicated subject.
What am I doing?
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Then say it.
I don't know.
Washed away.
Because life is good.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
Why do you care?
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
There was a review.
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
A little drastic maybe?
What?
You know what.
I hear good things about the new play.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Is it true?
Is what true?
I don't know.
He's a very sweet man.
Someone waiting for you?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes.
What? Come on, Paisley.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Everyone takes his turn.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
Enough.
What are you doing?
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
What'd he say?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
What can we do?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
We need your help!
The fools!  Sorry...
It's split the Government.
Perhaps some tea?
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Have you read his magazine?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No?  What's keeping you?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
That's the last.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
What are you waiting for?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Hello.
Good to see you're feeling better.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Six one.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
Who died?
The Mission Director.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Call German.
Any particular reason?
We can't stay here.
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
Where?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You really had other offers?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
How was your evening?
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Where are we going?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
How are you, Jerome?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Where are you going?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
German, is that you?
Hugo!  I've found him!
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
I was at home.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Why don't we say we were together?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
We were just looking.
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
You didn't know?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
I envy you, Jerome.
So you didn't do it after all.
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
Let's walk.
I can't.
My medication.  I left it back there.
--when you go away.
A year is a long time.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
The doctor will give you something.
I'm not doing it.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
Hello, McCoy.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
And you got him...
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
Hi.
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Assumed name... Houston.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
How does it taste?
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
That's not all of it.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's all right.
Really?
How was it?
$250,000 right off the top.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
I couldn't have... much longer.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
I didn't. I just waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
You know how I feel?
Bullshit.
What about the bank?
Doc...
I don't want to go there.
Why didn't you tell me?
Who's she?
What do we do?
And switched keys.
How long ago.
Fifteen minutes.
Texas is a big state.
I can handle it.
Do you mean that?
Why, there's nothing on the news?
That would be the first time.
When are you going to learn?
Only one car.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I want to say something.
I don't want to hear it.
No more about Beynon.
You want to try with me?
Okay.
You and me.
I'll be ready.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Come on, come on.
Who was it?
Where do we go from here?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
What now?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Where?
You were with him?
Aren't we going a little hard?
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Then you do it.
Drive.
Just fine.
Which way?
What's it to you?
Come on. How much?
You serious?
And I keep my mouth shut?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
That right?
You can trust him...
Two years.
I've got to stop.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Yes.
When did you find out?
What did you do?  Albert?
Yes. I told him.
What do you want?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
Oh ay?
What about the brakes?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
I know.
That's not good enough.
Jack?
That's nice.
Who paid you to see me off?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Where's he living these days?
Everyhing go off all right?
What about?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
I can't.
How were things between you and Frank?
He was all right to me.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Once a week?
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
You know Sid Fletcher?
I work for him.
Do you?
Who?
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
While he was here. You went about together?
Could you do me a favour?
So where are we going, Princess?
And what was that?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What kind of entertaining?
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
You've been watching the film.
Was it Albert?
Did my brother Frank find out?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Nice of you to come.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
How's school?
I left last year.
Working at Woolworths.
Where you going to live, then?
At me friend's house.
Where's that?
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
It just would. He was always the same.
Don't know.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
What you having, Jack?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Nowt.
Where you off to?
How many?
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
I'm staying with a friend.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
Definitely.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
I'm sorry.
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
I'll call the police.
Now just a minute...
You sod.
They came back?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
What about Keith?
What you going to do?
Pension him off.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you awake?
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
No chance of that.
Not much.
They're friends of mine.
And that'll make me feel better?
You coming back?
Is he?
Jack Carter.
What you doing around here then?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Eh? Have a drink.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We've got to take you back to London.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
They do that up North.
Not suede boots!
Knock it off, Gerald.
What's that? A hundred?
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
Four hundred?
I'll see you, then.
Polacks and deadbeats.
...Polacks...
I had to.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You did?
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
They killed the goose.
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It's too...
It is.
Eh?
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
I...
It's not.
That's right?
Eh...?
...that's right...
...that's right...
He is?
The nurses?
What?
Starting up.
What?
Just the act.
No.
You...
You...
You build it!
You fucking build it!  Men come...
They...
They have...
Somebody...
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
No, we're just...
As an idea.
No.
As a robbery.
Well.  Well...
No.  Not actually.
Did you?
You're going to steal the leads?
Is that what I said?
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
I'm sorry?
Yes.
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
Why would they come to me?
They're going to come to everyone.
No.
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
Me?
Absolutely.
I didn't ask to be.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
And why is that?
Fine.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Yes.
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
It is dead.
It's a waste of time.
They stole...
He said we...
To the cops?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
The cops?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
Where were you?
Where was I?
Was I?
Yes.
No, who?
Thieves.
They're inured to it.
You think so?
Will you excuse...
Where did Moss...?  I...
Did they...?
You understand?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
You...
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
That they're going to be upset.
The leads come in, I'll let...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Excuse me, sir...
Excuse me, fella.
The people downtown said...
You're done, come down, and let's...
...then...
Roma.
Under him?
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Murray said...
Either way.  You're out.
I'm out.
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
I will close.
I'm not sure I have two.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Now?  Now?
What happened?
The leads are coming.
You are?
Well, hadn't it?
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
Only the beginning...
I've got the check...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Don't.
I'm sorry.
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
You did that?
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Eight units?
That's right.
Just now.
How was it...?
From the store.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Uh...
Home...
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
You're sure?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Me.
Did I...?
Yes.
What do I...?
Yes.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
You don't count Saturday.
What would have elapsed?
If we wait till Mon...
Yest...
What was yesterday?
I told you.
What's going on here?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I can't regotiate.
I...
What...?
The power to negotiate.
This.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck the Machine.
You hear what I said?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Fuck you.
Guess who?
You just this morning...
Why not?
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
I'm going home.
They didn't get my contracts.
You did?
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
If you don't want it, give it back.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
We had a slight burglary last night.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Are you alright?
Did you like your party?
I got lots of presents.
No, where is it?
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Just a few days.
Will you take me?
To do business.
I can help you.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Yes, thank you.
I got surprises for everybody!
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Would you like some?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
He is weak.
He will grow strong.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Beautiful.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
How long does this go on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?
Me too, Tom?
If you need anything, just...
But if you're wrong...
They can come in now.
Was it a boy or a girl?
It was a boy.
And Kay...she's all right?
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
That plane goes to Miami...
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
What's up?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Did my brother go back?
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
Whose orders are these?
Kay.
How's the baby?
Does it feel like a boy?
Kay, I told you...
Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
How is his health?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
I know.
When do we talk?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle on their terms.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
We'll try.
Rosato, where's your brother?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Are we going to eat or what?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
The same assurance we got from you.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
He supports me.
I accept your generosity...
What makes you say that?
What's to be jealous of?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You liked it too.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Your wife?
I'm not married.
You ever been married, Hanna?
Of course.  I am married still.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
A homo?
You did not know?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
What have you done with him?
Good morning.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
Or would you prefer a beer?
These are your paintings?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What did she mean by going flooey?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
You don't say?  Which picture?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
Did anyone laugh?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Not at the moment.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
If that's okay?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
No.  The girl.
Run for what?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Do I have any other choice?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Do you mind?
I don't remember that one.
What won't do?
You are much too human.
What was that?
You okay?
Oh Clayton.
Did I hurt you?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Need some help?
You'll feel better tomorrow.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Thank you.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Does the yardman come today?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
One likes to live simply.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Sure.
You're serious.
Then the rumors are true?
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
What are you doing here?
What kind of job... ?
Who was the job for?
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
I think about that night a lot...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Get out of here, Ray --
One more night --
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, that certainly won't do.
I know you --
You know my back -
Let them go --
You have my word...
I know you.
I know you.
I'm on the move -
Your girl works in there ...
I know you.
Consider me gone, Detective --
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Double-meaning intended --
Who is it -- ?
What's this -- ?
What's wrong with it -- ?
The other day....
How'd it go?
Got it ...
What's the matter?
C'mon, man ...
Donny --
Peugot convertible ...
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
That's a good one, Donny...
How are we supposed to--
How you know that?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
You, too, Ma...
No.
You getting my checks ... ?
Oh, for God's sake
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
You guys are through...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
You goin' home?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Any more ...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
Kip -- ?
Yeah ...
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
Hey, you want something to eat ?
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
You can handle it?
You?
Me.
You?
"Shadow games?"
Thank-you ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
What era was that -- ?
The era when crime didn't pay --
You okay -- ?
What?
Come here -
What?
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...
Where you off to -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Now what -- ?
Shit ...
He give you an advance -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Where we going -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Call 911 -
Call 'em here -- ?
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
"Mitch?"
On account of Mitch?
A distinction worth noting ...
And you got some Italians -- ?
I go with you --
That what you want?
You mentioned that in your letters
No way ...
No ... ?
Ready -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Slip it in ...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
Unlock your button ...
Cut 'em...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Hear you roar ...
What about The Club ... ?
You okay -- ?
This time it's for real?
What's that?
Hello, Otto ...
You remember Junie?
You think it can be done?
You need him...
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
What happened to Sway?
How old are you now, Toby?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
So she flies -
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Why don't you leave him alone?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Which way's out, man -- ?
What did you hear about that thing?
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Nods again.
Anybody!  You understand?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
What do you do?
Go inside. I'll be right there.
My bag. My bag.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Who's gonna do that?
Where's the stuff?
What are you talking about?
You know. The stuff I left.
What happened? You okay?
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Paulie was just talking about him.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Give'm a drink.
I gotta talk to you.
There are cops all over the place.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
You ready?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
I hate to do dishes.
Are you okay? What happened?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
I got dry cleaning.
Who's she talking to?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Suck my cock!
All right, then.
Stop brushin' me back!
She didn't do it again did she?
What do we got?
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Why not?
How's the woman?
Gone.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
What class?
Hi.
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
How much money you got?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I don't think I...Larry?
I have about seventy-three...
How'd you like that course?
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
Where is it touching you?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Which one's your building?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
Yes. Under two conditions.
Of course.
Okay. How?
I think so.
What's that?
--Half-red, half-black--
--That edge!
I told you to cooperate with these people.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
What are you smiling at?
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Find out what?
Good to meet you.
Yeah, cured polio.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I got it.
Tom.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You're here quite a bit, then.
Seems like it's going well.
Now wait a minute--
--And confuse him--
Hello, Sean.
Come in.
Sean...
Where're you going?
Why there?
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
There is somebody...
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
Like what, Will?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Yeah, I read those.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
285.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
I don't know.
Why not?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
No, I don't.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
I guess.
What did you think?
They're all dead.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Don't give me you line of shit.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Gotta go with the belt there...
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not your fault.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know.
It's not...
That's what you want?
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
You suck.
Five minutes.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No I wasn't...
You grew up around here?
How was that?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I have twelve big brothers.
Do you know all their names?
I want to meet them.
Where have you been?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
They don't come over here that much.
How's it goin'?
Some, a little.
Just for fun?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
I want you to come with me.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
And you're sure about that?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
I'm not honest?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Take care.
You doin' the hirin'?
Ready, Pa?
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Ready, Ma?
Don't hold me so tight.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Lots must a died, too.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Any gas?
What'd he look like again?
I didn't see nothin'.
Want to work?
Sure, but what is this?
Joad.
How many men?
Four.
Women?
Two.
Kids?
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
Joad. Tom Joad.
Why ain't they more like it?
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
Yeah. On my way home now.
Is it fur?
They never wrote you nothing?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
What's the matter?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
You ain't got to get sore.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
How 'bout Granma?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Where you going?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Got any plants?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Anybody ask anything?
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
How about it, Ma?
Ma, you sick?
Ya say we're acrost?
No.
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Sure. Good-by.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
You can have this for ten cents.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Which ones?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Here we go!
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
Morning.
Can you pick peaches?
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
You do not.
Yes I do.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Oh... really?
What do you do?
You do not.
It's what I do.
So, what are you doing now?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Bob...
It's me. Martin Blank.
Really...? So what?
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
I want to be an actor.
Jesus...
I just play my own collection.
Not much else.
What's your business?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Bad experiences.
You met people.
Bad people.
Watched television?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Unbelievable.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
As long as I get the laugh.
You look beautiful.
Do you want to get a drink first?
...About five years now.
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
I was leaving.
Will you come with me?
I'm staying here.
How do you know?
I just know.
You know where I live?
Yes.
What stuff?
No harm no foul.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
Lisbon?
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Don't forget your identity.
This is not good.
What's it look like?
You haven't looked at the dossier.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
I spoke to your father the other day.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
What the hell happened to you?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
It didn't work out.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
I'm a professional killer.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Does Chicago count?
You lived in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Need a lift?
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Thanks.
Feel good?
How long did you live here with your wife?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Show me again.
Annie!
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Mom?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I don't care.
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
You already did.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
What did you say?
Started what?
My period.
That's not true.
So do you.
How's everything?
Good.
Great!
David?
Did you speak to Farlow?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
It's me.
Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I should be in by two.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
I'm sorry.
We're very lucky.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Aw... that's so sweet.
I love you.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
What if she doesn't want to go?
She will if you think she should.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I miss you, Annie.
Good night.
Everything all right.
How are you feeling about work?
Take your time.
What do you mean?
I have so much to tell you.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
It's so cruel.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
I'd love to go there one time...
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Promise?
Good luck to you, Annie.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Mixed salad.
When you figure on branding?
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Tom?
Would you let me ride your horse?
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Jude, you okay?
No, not yet.
Did you notice -- no cane?
Don't be such a baby!
You just showing off for her!
I can't believe it's the same horse.
We still have a way to go.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
What are you looking at, young man?
Long enough.
You ever miss it?
Now that's cool.
Cool?
You think it's cool?
Secret Service!
Welcome to our show!
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Let's keep her.
What's that?
Shit!
Right.
Very impressive.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Snoop onto them...
I want it to have my children!
One-handed!
Cereal.
Who's that?
Dead.
Dade?
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
How was school?
Blow me.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Yo, showtime, showtime!
What's this one eat?
Oh, shit! He got me.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Think you can do better?
What the hell is going on?
He's not in this class.
I said give me time.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Are you challenging me?
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
You're not gonna win.
We need your help.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Kate, listen.
There they are!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Ready?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
You look good in a dress.
You would have looked better.
Hello?
We caught 'em.
Never fear. I is here.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Joey, Joey...
What is he doing in here?
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
What is it? What's wrong?
Thank you.
Just one moment.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
We need to talk.
Okay sure. What about?
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Don't get angry.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Are you two okay?
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Not without Jamie.
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
What does that mean?
Brady!
Get back!
Go!
Get up there Rachel!
An accident?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Can't you find somebody else?
How do we look?
Honey, I don't think their home.
How do you know their not?
We should call the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I do.
Outside.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Night Doc.
Like a sister?
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Jamie!
Rachel come on.
No.
I can't.
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Why?
Hi Rachel.
I don't want to look pushy.
Call me.
Hell of a night.
Its not over yet.
Right here, Ben.
You look sharp. You understand?
132 to 133 this is 134.
You got your riot gun?
Get the outside shutters.
He's here, Sheriff.
Something?
He's been here.
This is starting to spook me.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Where's that Deputy?
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Car trouble?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Okay.
Now you understand?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
What?
You're going to be late!
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Saving the treats for Bob?
I have a place for that.
Look where?
He was standing right here.
Annie, was that you?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
You still spooked?
Probably Mister Riddle.
He can still watch.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I can't.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Ten minutes.
A man wouldn't do that...
Jesus!
You all right?
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
I don't like that story.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What about the bogyman?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Promise?
Who is it?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Are you sure?
Yes.
How?
Laurie, you come with us...
Will you get her for me?
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
PROBABLY going.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
If you say so.
Only minimum security.
I see.
What does that mean?
Pull up to the entrance!
...any sister talk?
Oh, good...
I love that.  That's my type.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh, yeah.
That's just --
I know.  It's terrible!
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
It depends on what way you want to go.
No, he called late last night.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Right.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Is this your first job?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yeah.
It's really sad.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Now I ca-can't remember.
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Could you--
Like, uh...?
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Ohhhh!
How about you?
Yes, I do.
Yes?
No!  No...
No?
Uh, yes!
Yes.
Yeah.  How are you?
I'm...all right.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Bye.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
This is not an easy situation.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
No.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
They're fantastic.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Great idea.
Are you in a bad mood?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
Hi.  How's she doing?
Oh, Mom!
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Why should I be afraid?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
How do you know?
Want some coffee or tea?
Are you sure?
Mmm...
Me?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
You've been with someone!
I'm saying it now!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Hello?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Doesn't she look pretty?
So how are you?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
How are you?
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Hi!  Hi!
I got two minutes.
How is everything?
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
That's really nice!
Thanks, thanks.
Mh-hm.
Isn't that great?
This is the second opinion.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Hey!
What?  You're kidding!
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
It's, uh, you never know--
He's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Ouch!
Sometimes she's terrific...
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
Uh-huh.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Awwww...
Oh, gosh.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
No!
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I remember you.
How are you?
Good.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You look wonderful.
It was a terrible evening.
I'd never do that.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
People change...you know.
So how are you?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, the reason I ask is--
No, I haven't.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
When'd you get here?
Just a few minutes ago.
Mickey?
Mmm, what?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
Oh...
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
I can't think.
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
And?
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I have not read you your rights.
Well.  Word gets around.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Now, whyn't you help us?
We could skip the Gavotte.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...they did it for a lark.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You're ready now.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
How you doin?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
I know her by the Back.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...nightmare.
Impossible.
Hold up a minute...
You take this much time over everything?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Not with any certainty we...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
No.  And...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
You give me whatever I want...?
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
What reaction?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Try Barney Clark.
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...young boys, still...?
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
...unmarked hundreds....
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Why?
For a consideration.
Sir:
...what's he got against you?
Look at this:
...what'm I looking at...?
I know you did what you could.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
Said what?
What'd you say, hon...?
Waited too long, hon...?  
A wonderful country...
I have had many excellent meals there.
...should love to correct your error. 
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
I require...
Where do you live?
We got KittyKat...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
...may be the heat....
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
And how did he do that?
Thank you, Cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
...what did you want? 
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
Brazilian. 
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
She must be something special After Dark.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Then what brings you back?
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I..
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Man, she's losing it...
No, they're not from Wendy.
Goodnight, Jasper.
That would be a No.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Yes you do.
Yeah. I guess I do.
I think your passion is terrific.
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
God, you're beautiful.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Oh, I have to hear this.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Because you're an idiot.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
I'll think about it.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
You stupid cunt!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Guess who?
No.
Veronica, you look like hell.
No way, no day!
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
And your worst enemy.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Mute!
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
Did to.
Did not.
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Let's kick his ass.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Is it sleeping, dude?
I guess.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Come on! Sausage rolls.

Come on, sit up.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
Can I go now?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I think I'm dying . . .
Him.

It's so beautiful!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
But that's not true! I've got one.
Mummy!
Bye, Dad.
Are you a dream too?
Your insight is enlightening.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
The way you just looked at me...
Second most common?
Skin cancer.
Eighty third most common.
Must be nice.
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Ambrose. I know.
Have we met?
What did you just say?
I said she's been missing for-
You could say that.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
You win! Okay pull over.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Where's my wife?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I don't work here.
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
I got your bail continued.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
He gives a good report and I walk?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Often, uh.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Here.  Get off here.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
What is it?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Upset!  What's he upset about?
She wants to quit?
It's not unthinkable.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
Never reach out!
You didn't... get it on with him?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
What about?
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
Are you being helped, sir?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Well, it's for a woman.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
-- hospital.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
As long as you keep remembering why.
-- a sense of proportion.
Yeah, that was easy.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Everything breaks at once.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
About what?
Baby, what is it?
I'm thirsty.
A man scared me.
Have you just plain asked him?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
How were we -- were we cool?
He made, you know, a remark.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
I hear things in this house,
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
He wants to see me!
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
He wasn't there.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Who was that?
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
Let's follow 'em.
What for, dickweed?
Are we gonna buy this house?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Neil, do you mind?
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
It's a double.
Even better.
I'd like that.
Would you?
Really?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
What do you think?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
He had to come from somewhere.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Detective Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
Around.
No.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
What?
The river.
That's all?
Thank you, Thomas.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
To ask her to dance.
What worries you?
Well?
I'll go first.
No -- I will.
I stood up first.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
She's a treasure she is.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Your life.
The past?
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
I cannot explain.
Then take me with you.
Are you a cop?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
Yes.  How did you know?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
You're hurt.
Because it's my name.
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't have any answers for you.
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
No.
I've seen it.
Where will you go now?
It will end tonight.
He's in there!
Be careful, Conner.
We found him this morning.
What's that next to him?
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
I was working on the cataloging.
That's what the Kurgan said.
How can that be?
Is there anything else you need?
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
You kept it?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
Talley?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Let me come get him.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
Who else is here?
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
We can take it with us.
I got the gasoline --
What the fuck is that?
Keeps to himself, more like.
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
Give me an ETA.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
Where is it?
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Ow!  Shit!
You leave that gun alone!
Want one?
What do you want?
Please get away from me.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
What's going on?
Just one question.  Please.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
That's enough.
That's not enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Louise?
Louise?
I know the one.
Chief, base.
You have her cell number?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
Let it go, Captain.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's mine.  Talley.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
What's my name?
The kids are in here!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
Where are you right now?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Who is it?
Where are my children?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
These disks . . . where are they?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
We, who is we?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Please, I don't use guns.
How much?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Ten.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes we have.
What was the response?
Paul, you know who this is?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
They fired a rocket at us.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Satellites.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
I'll be over.
When?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I am on a list! What list?
I led no massacres.
You think they will believe you?
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Very soon.
There are no more rooms.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
For supplies, you drive.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I would never do that.
You are the manager?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Who did you call?
What do you want?
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
Excuse me.
What?
Our cards, please.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Thomas wants advice?
He wants your wisdom.
Let's have dinner first.
Do something.
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
This won't do.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
What about us?
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
So where is the lamb?
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
It was substantial.
What sort of car?
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
I have to stay.
Let me go. Children get off.
We are almost out of water.
We have to have a plan.
Rutaganda's place?
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
He has taken the presidential suite.
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
How much beer?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.
Paul, are you there?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
There are soldiers.
Where?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
What is his room number?
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
So what stopped her?
Jesus H. Christ!
Melissa!
What?
Where is it??
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
-- I did: down here.
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
What's in there?
What's down there?
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
-- the stained glass --
I'm better than that.
Most fun I've had all day.
I don't think so...
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Good point.
Cheery looking bunch.
What --
What?
...Jesus H. Christ.
You're hurting me.
-- the sadistic prick --
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
Jesus!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
You didn't think to ask?
I was in the middle of --
You think this is fucking funny??
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- even if I give you a million as well?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I was upstairs!
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- it wasn't me.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Oh, no.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Won't do any good.
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
He must've unsealed the room!
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
For the love of God....please...?
Something....happened --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Damn it.
Town records are coming up now.
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
It will heal.
Good-bye.
By killing them?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
Maybe it was Colleen...
It's going to hurt us!
Can you talk to her?
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
We're going to go someplace new.
What about all my other stuff?
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She says she's lonely...
Where is she?
She's here.
Where is she now?
She's down.  Help her...
Help me!  Please!!!
Can I have this room daddy?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
What's he doing daddy?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Mommy please help me!
Don't be afraid!
Good night Angel...
Oh come on...
To our family.
What the hell is that?
So what are you saying?
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
Whoa there...
What are you talking about?
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
She's gone!
Aubrey!
I'm fine.
Maura, what is this!
Maura!
You're bleeding.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Oh, that's nice...
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
How long will it take!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something through that wall!
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
So where is it?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
What is it?
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
That's great.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
I'll boil some water.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
How have you ... ?
Buying some drugs, alright?
What am I looking for?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
You're JP Monroe, right?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Yes really.
Wow.  Thank you.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
Joey?
Not quite.
Really?
Oh, I don't ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That was beautiful.
Eighth room down, babe...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
Count of three?
Now that's a lock.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
Welcome back to Vinci.
What the hell....
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
What have you been doing?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Trust Leonardo....
No, let me!
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Remember that shoe you lost...
Get away from there, convict!
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Something short.
Sharp.
With a little jazz.
The Shazzammeter!
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
The Hudswinger!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Adenoids?
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I know that, Amy.
You know, on farm route 17.
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Now, Amy --
Norville!
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
...education, were you?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
You're fired.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
I got gas, Bennie.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...Enter the dame.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Maybe he's wise.
He don't look wise.
Old Faithful.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
Good morning, miss.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Where?
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I'm afraid so.
She can never be cured?
I've never heard of a cure.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
You're single?
But it's so far away...
Where do you think you're going?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
It is not beautiful.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
A mental case?
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I suppose so.  Yes.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I heard you playing.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I wanted to help you.
She was beautiful.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Got a meeting uptown.
Right o'.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
You're staring at me.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Good night.
You want to go?
What do you think?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I... I think I am...
That shirt?
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Yeah, that one.
What's for dessert?
Don't start.
You think I --
What do you mean?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
You're not going to --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ready to go?
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
The phone's out.
All right.
Classes?
Good.
Grades?
Sure dad.
See you.
Ben--
Huh?
Birth control.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Your toes cold?
But...
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
It's what?
Thank you Janey.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You okay?
Hi mom.
With Mikey?
Who?
Nobody.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
It's not a bother.
I used to know how to cook.
Social work?
How'd you know?
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
But not too ashamed.
See ya.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Huh?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
You going to tell dad?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Maybe you should have just a half.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Who said so?
Yeah?
Where you going?
Out.
Want some gum?
Sure.  Twinkie?
Did you tell Sandy?
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
When worlds collide.
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
With who?
Hey Wendy.
Mikey was looking for you.
What are you doing?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Want a drink?
It feels warm.
One more shot?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Yes, sir.
Just after Leland Street.
What's the D.A. got them on?
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
We already did.
Do it again.
She your only sibling?
I don't remember.
It's legitimate.
I know.
Sorry about...
He would have liked that.
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
What time was that?
We're sure it's hers?
What are you doing here?
Forget your pager?
Where you signed this?
How do you mean?
Randy Stetz?
Eight years.
To do nothing.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Your friend's all business.
I'm not expecting anyone.
That's not what he thinks.
Will...I...
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
What kind of stuff?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Best friend?
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You and Kay were like sisters?
I don't know.
You don't know.
She wouldn't tell me!
My arm!
Down at the station?
But you wanted to.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Yes.  Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
No back-up.
Wild card.
Yes, and very beautiful.
So you have the answers...
Ah! You have questions?
What are we?
Nothing if not vampires...
Who made us what we are?
That is a picture, nothing more.
Then God does not exist...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I was waiting for you...
No, my beloved, my child.
That's what the one who made me said.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
Why always on this night?
I didn't realise.
And if I cut my hair again?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Claudia - don't -
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Louis, look at me.
How do I look?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
This is monstrous!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
He can protect us, Claudia.
But if she dies...
Then my luck would have changed.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
Give it to me!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Let's call that a start.
I can't do it.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You really want to be with them?
You're sure?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
Dear God, what have I done?
But how do you know?
Read her thoughts.
Paris? You came from Paris?
What do you imagine you are Louis?
The girl, Lestat -
She's here, your wounded one.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved Yvette...
Can a vampire feel love?
But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.
You're in 201 and 202.
What about a radio?
Listen to me. He's here.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
Say yes.
No.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
I'm the King of the World.
Karla! You promised.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Don't even think about it.
No way.
Yes.
Karla!
Let him go. I believe him.
Be careful, Julie.
There's no way to lock it.
I'm holding your hand!
No, you're not.
Oh, god, it's you --
You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Ray, I can't...
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
I love it here.
Checking the locks again?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
Who?
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm fine.
You sure?
I'm fine.
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
He's in it with Willis?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Ahh, that feels great.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
Not anymore.
He leave you?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
How's the water?
We'll only be a second, okay?
What is up with that weirdo?
) You feel the symptoms?
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
She has never mentioned her family.
What are you doing?
You are fortunate in your father.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
I have forgotten it, dear.
But one must love a father.
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
You wouldn't tell that ——
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Theodosia.
Your daughter is ill.
She's not too well.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
It makes me fear her.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
Listen to what I say --
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Get that ladder up here.
All right –– all right.
Good morning, sir.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Well, who are you, then?
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
Clarence . . .
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Hey, who's that?
Who is it?
What's that book you've got there?
I know. I know.
Hey, Ernie!
Hiya, George!
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Is this the place?
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Well?
Well, sure I do.
When'd you see him last?
Well, what happened to you?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
There it is, good as new.
Hee-haw!
What boat you sailing on?
Goodbye, everybody!
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Nice girl, Mary.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
George! George!
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Aw, forget it.
Oh, it's wonderful.
He's pretty young for that job.
Well, no younger than I was.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
Got a match?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
What gives?
Say hello to New York for me.
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Made up your mind yet?
With coconuts?
Me?
Neither am I.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
In that place?
Oh, no.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Where'd you get that dress?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Please, let's not stop, George.
Have fun.
Hi.
Is it snowing?
Yeah, just started.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Where're you going?
You have no idea what's happened to me.
You forgot something.
How fast does this go?
Come on, you guys.
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
How fast is enough?
My hair's getting wet!
Oh, shit.
Someone pop your balloon?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Don't!
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
No.
Maybe by now they are.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
We better go back in.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
No!  It's still there!
What is it?  What's there?
It's still there!
Good morning!
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
If there is, develop it!
Untie that rope.
Oh, c'mon.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
Mike?  Is that you?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
What else you got?
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
Is that what it is?
Look at that:
The whale's mouth?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
That's it.
Okay, so that's it.
And sound.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Fooling around?
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera?
It's good with coffee.
Where's my day book?
Oww!
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
No.
It was bad, wasn't it.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
That's great.
Sean's asleep.
What?
What'd I say?
What're you doing?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Did he raise the Kids?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go swimming?
Some people.
Can I go with you today?
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
Is that me?
That's you.
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Help!  Help!
Nope.
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
Shut up.
The wind drift is lateral.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
And second?
How much longer?
About damn time.
What is it?
Power line.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'm not sure I can.
I don't care.
Faster!  Faster!
Heading back?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Not tonight.
They're turning around.
You always go with Andy.
I want Fruit Loops!
You're going out.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Take me.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Brody's riding his tower.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, you're tired.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
With those camera lights and...
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
It's Miller time!
You buying?
Yeah.  Down there.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Thank you.
Well, not much longer to go.
What is it, 97 days?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Pre-opening jitters.
Yeah.
Honey, I gotta go.
And what else is bothering you?
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Not enough loving.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
What do I do now?
Take a deep breath and hold it.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
No.
Are you scared?
Damn it!
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
It's romantic down here.
What's wrong?
After what happened to us?
I know I can capture it.
Here.
What's that?
Change your mind?
Finally.
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
No, we'll go through here.
... Mean through the tubes?
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Somebody better get down there!
Michael, you're not going down there.
I am.  You're not.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Are you okay?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
No, no.  That won't do.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
I want that shark alive.
You look like an orange worm.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
How's sleeping beauty?
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Thanks for helping.
Not at all.
I like it when they wake up.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
I think they'll come out now.
They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
Sure.
Musclehead?
Sure.  No problem.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
So, you just get here?
... Massachussettans aren't.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
I don't know, what else is there?
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Told you you'd like it.
No...  It can't be.
Let's go, let's go!
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I don't talk that way.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Now what?
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Yes, there is goes.
Calvin said it was all right.
Make sure you put this back.
No, South Georgia.
What the hell's there?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
I'll go with you.
It's not closing, Mike.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Look great, don't I?
Took it this morning.
He needs a haircut.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Come on, let's go.
Something wrong?
She still talking to you?
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
You'll spoil her.
Come on, sweetheart....
But you always let me....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
Can I make sandwiches...?
Yes, I did.
No way....
Make a list.
We need beer....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
Then don't come any closer.
Turn it off....
Off....
Where have you been...?
You knew...?
Where's my mother?
It'll grow on you.
Henny Youngman....
You caught me....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Beginning of what?
We'll be there....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop what?
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
The fish.  Check it....
You check it....
He heard that.
In a minute....
Can I ride one sometime...?
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
You're coming, aren't you...?
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're damn right I'm serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
All you all right?
I'll be all right, Michael.
Mom, please don't start that again....
You could teach...You could....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
You hungry?
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It could have been an accident....
Sure you can....
I don't know how....
It's just like driving a car....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I'm fine.
No, you're not....
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I have my own little island.
You're always taking time off....
I borrow it without telling him....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I can't....
They had them on the big one....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Hurry!
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Keep it steady....
Yeah....
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
Inch by inch....
I wish there was something I could do....
Stop farting around....
Stop busting my hump....
Will you leave me alone...?
The females have eggs....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I stuck them on, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Put me down....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
Forget it....
Money is money....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
How many?
Where is everybody?
When we got the grant....
When I got the grant.....
When I signed on....
When I invited you...
We got it together, Jake....
And it's always worked?
Bring her to starboard.
Who?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
We lost it....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
I'm coming...How close is it?
I don't like it....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
I'm going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
Funny, Jake...Funny.
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
What the hell are you doing?
I've got to get to her....
All the time....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Oh, Jake... 
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
The van?
How about any guys on your staff?
I hope I'm not intruding?
What do you think?
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
Because, don't get into it ...
There's nothing in the files?
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
You gotta stop smoking ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
I haven't got it.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
What do you want it for?
Did he shut you down?
Did I say he did?
Why's she blind, Bro?
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Where's your watch?
I guess by the bed.
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Three or four.
And did they?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
No .. But we have a theory ..
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Vehicle references.
What color was it?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
I know what you're like ..
Ross told me.
Just your age.
Which is what?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why can't I stay with you?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
Why does he want to kill me?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He don't know that. I didn't.
He doesn't need my help.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Yes, Sir.
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
She married some English prick.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Who told you?
Okay, this is working.
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
No.
Didn't hear it.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
I see what you're saying.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
... this is... uh... too funny...
No no...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
Oh no.
No no. I knew.
You think so?
That took guts.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Well, I'm happy for you.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Beer okay?
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
Truth?
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Oh God.
Fine, I just --
Sure you're okay to drive this?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
You want...
I don't know --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
What about medical?
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
Good.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Call me tomorrow.
--  the kwan.
You're telling me to dance.
What's wrong.
Forget it.  Forget it.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
That's an answer.
Fine.
Jerry!  You made it --
How sad --
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
You gonna get that --
You okay?
... dick?
You'll lose.
They do, my brother.
Hi.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
You said "fuck".
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Can you be quiet?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
What is it?
You hate to swim.
You look good.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
What?
What did you say!
Young adult.
That's him. That’s Eric!
Udesky.
It's not safe.
I don't remember
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
We should try fishing again.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Where's Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Eric!
How was your trip? Profitable?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Absolutely not.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
ALAN!
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Anything good?
Raptors, mostly.
You remember the sounds they made?
You think they could talk to each other?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
A well-accepted theory.
In Costa Rica?
Are you sure?
You should.
We're safe!
I have never been on this island!
Amanda!
It matches the pictures.
You hear something?
Any damage?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Are you looking for a problem?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
What are you guys gonna do?
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Okay.
Where do you think you're going?!
What is?
What is that?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
Their what?
She's gutty.
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
What do they want?!
No.
Lava?
No.
What are they?
Come on!
Where's Kelly?
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Head for the roof!
I have to find Kelly!
I think she's with Sarah!
Something's wrong.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Why should they?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
Funded by whom?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Ian.  It's guano.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
-- way we could safely --
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
You're sure we have to?
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
Phones are out too.
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
Are you sure?
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
So what are you thinking?
Oh, shit.
Not just every six weeks.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - barfs them up - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
Alan?!
Okay, I'm on channel two.
No. We can't.
It's all right.
That's right.  Will break through.
I get ah - -
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
Dino droppings?
Can we chance moving him?
Yes?
Hola, Juanito
I can't see.
Up and down, up and down!
Are they heavy?
I read your book.
Listen, ahh - -
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
I doubt it.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
Go, go, go, jump!
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
Machines hate you?
Yeah, they hate me.
Where does he think he's going?
You're sure?!
Oh my God!
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Can't you stop these things?!
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Tim!  Lex!
He left us!  He left us!
It's safe?
It's safe.
I'll stay awake.
I like cows.
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
John, John.
We miss you.
Thanks for the presents.
Why did you do this?
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
That's not funny.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Mister Biller?
I think we're lost.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Who is this? What's going on?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
I don't know...
He... he's here...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
_Krueger_...
Who?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Well?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Cute waitresses?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
See this?
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn't make sense.
Add it to the list.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
About ten minutes.
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Yes -- we do.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
You work in the cemetery.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Then its authority is in doubt.
A true friend would do it.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You're just doing your job.
You're detestable.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
You don't believe that.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
I don't know.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
What makes you think so?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
-- Just doing our job.
That's <u>mad</u>.
May I ask where your two warders are?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Oskar!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
I'm sorry ...
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
They' re dead.
What was it, Jack?
Are you nervous Jack?
Yeah.
What's that?
Compassion.
What about him? Yes.
Well I have to close up now.
Well we're pretty --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I guess he figured it was better.
Like for you to look for the man.
-- We can talk --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
I said yes, I see.
What about?
My name's John Klute.
You remind me of my uncle.
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
What? This?
What do you think?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
What're you gonna do next?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
-- Then you don't need me.
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
Is that all you have to say?
You and I -- a relationship.
Right back at the start, right?
With Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
How do you know how bad it was?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Mm.
You're going back?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Then, close the case.
I better keep looking.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Just send me a money order.
Have you discussed this with them?
All right.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Well?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Mr. Kramer?
Where is the child?
He's in his room, playing.
Not particularly.
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest.
Greatest...
Show.
On earth.
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm allergic to onions.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Daddy?
Yeah?
Daddy?
Is mom ever coming back?
Good night.
Yes?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
No, she never did.
Mom--I mean, dad?
What did you do when you were little?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Yeah, there was apple juice.
I don't understand, daddy.
Objection!
No, I did not.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
And what is your present salary?
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
Is that...permanent?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Were you?
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
I've seen him.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Ted, do you love him?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Only can I still see him?
Yes.
I lost him?  I lost him?
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Yeah.
How many?
No.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
You're sure?
She ever ask about me?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You heard anything yet?
Ted.
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
All quiet?
Where are you from?
Again?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
But, I am in charge.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Where will you keep them?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Goodbye, Kundun.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Dalai Lama.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Did you receive the letter?
With much bloodshed.
Holiness?
I miss my brother.
How many?
Who am I?
You could buy them.
Do I have money?
What do you think?
I am him.
How big is Tibet's army?
Is that big?
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
In the Pacific Ocean.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
Tell me.
Where is that?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
Did you ever doubt it?
They will take Lhasa next.
Please, come in, so cold.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Me?
I have more men.
Is that true or pretend?
Pretend.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
We have enemies.
The Chinese.
This is Britain.
Ahh.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
You will not come?
No, Holiness.
You, kill me?
It is possible, Holiness.
You are unharmed?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
No.
Too young?
Like my mother.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
It happens when I land.
Go!!!
And you like me.
What the hell are you doing?!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
You're crawling around like a--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
I can arrest you!!
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Where is he?!
He never said "go".
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
The more he thrashes, the better.
You ready on shore?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
He was an Indo-pacific.
Nothing's real.
No.
You're gonna be okay.
He's gonna live?
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Why are you here?  Really.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Oh my God.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Good.
You okay?  Kelly?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Ssssh!
What?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.
You calm down!
What?
Are we crazy?
He's mooing.
Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
You said nobody came in here!
Now I'm gonna puke.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
I'll take it!
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
I wouldn't.
Well.  At wakes.
This is a little different.
I got nothing against--
Was he swallowed?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
I thought I saw...
You threw it at me!!
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Hector thinks you like him.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
Hank?
Did you get him?
Kelly.
It's ten after nine.
Part of our research--
Backstabber?
No.
Liar?
Myra.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
"- every day."
Hot damn, Clarice.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Okay, Miss Starling?
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Who's the subject?
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I am, yes.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
I have no doubt of it.
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I didn't.
Your bleeding has stopped.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
The death of my father.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
A cattle ranch?
Two months.
Why so briefly?
Did he try to?
He kills w-
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes...! They were screaming.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
My God, you've grown up.
Are you alright?
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
No. I will find you.
Are we safe?
When? How?
My letter...
There was no letter.
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
What?!
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
We don't.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Wampum?
Gold could be arranged.
For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Qui vive?
France.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
It's got Hazy!
Jesus Christ...
Can you fix it?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Go on!
No!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
You did good...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Shit!  He sent them all.
How much time does that give us?
We made it!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
No!
I'm going inside.
What's your air reading?
Do it.
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
You got money in this tub?
Personal effects...
Yes sir...
What the?...
What happened?
It...almost got you.
Still bothering you?
So that's all you do?...
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
Typhoon?!
Getting some food.
How far away is she?
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
What are you going to do to him?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Clear for pickup.
Sixpack...
What's wrong?
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
Are you okay, Jonesy?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
How much did you part with?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought this was a pub.
Like what?
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I hate these Southern shites.
Nope.
Have you counted the money?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
You all right back there, mate?
About twenty minutes.
Is he on his own?
Just carrying a bag.
It's not him, Dad.
Is that you, Dean?
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Dog, I have found the cash!
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Yeah, one of them's out.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Where?
Out the back.
And the weed?
Invitations.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
There's nothing in it!
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
You and me, Tom.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
You got it all?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I will.
I'll see ya.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
You know how much it is, Nick.
And that does include the amp?
I'll only be a minute.
Look. Go on, look.
At what, exactly?
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many feet?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
I don't know what the big deal is.
I can't take any more school.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Who's "they"?
Do whatever they tell you--
I do, sir.
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Yes, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
And you and Private Graves--
Private Johnson!
I hear they're closing that post down.
That the word on our boy?
Charley Wade.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Colt Peacemaker.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
Whole different story; isn't it?
350 pounds.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Come on in--
If it's too late--
Where'd he get all this?
They fought against the Indians?
Same as they done in Mexico.
You know who I am?
I got a pretty good guess.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Didn't have a father?
You wouldn't?
How's your room shaping up?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
It's a .45.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We been through this before--
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
That where he was shot?
Reputation?
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
We don't need a new jail.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
We have a murder?
Fellas.
Hey, Sam.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
There must have been somebody.
I was too busy.
Thank you.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
Mrs. Bledsoe?
That's me.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Okay? He's not here?
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
That was the night he disappeared?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Mom?
You gonna stay out here?
What's she singing about?
She finally got in--
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Something wrong?
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
We haven't talked since high school.
He's all yours.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I thought you got through that pretty well.
People liked him.
Amado.
He hates me.
You've got your mother, your kids--
Wow.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Like your story is over.
Pilar--
What was your father's name?
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
You're out early.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
They got telephones.
You'd do a good job.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You think we need a new jail?
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
I know you?
Name's Otis.
Otis what?
I know that.
How come you don't took familiar?
You going to tell her?
Mister D'Amour?
How much?
Who?
Nix.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
You heard right.
Take a look at this.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
D'Amour.
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
About?
What about death?
I'll tell you.
Anything?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
Yes...
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
He's a secretive man.
Harry.
Harry.
I don't know where you'd start.
They won't tell you anything.
Why?  Because he had you?
So why did you marry him?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, right?
I wasn't.
Are you sure?
Yes.
What was that?
Oh God!
No!  No!  No!
I'm here, Harry.
...yes?
Don't look.
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Harry-?
Valentin?
Good.  There.  Yes?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
... they believe you.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Where the fuck is he?
They weren't worth a damn.
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour?
It's one in the afternoon.
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
Philip Swann?
You know of him?
I saw him in Vegas once.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Are you sure?
Who is she?
What the fuck are you doing here?
What for?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
I like to know why things happen.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
I can't let you in.
Leave her alone --
I tried to pay you off.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
D'Amour --
Shit...
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
My God.
The Puritan?
Yes...
What?
You know Vinovich?
For what?
Are they all in the business?
Look, Ma, no wires.
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
Yes.
They got here before us.
He's better off this way.
That's where we're all going.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
You didn't try hard enough.
I don't know.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
One question.
What?
He's not!  He's not!
Nix! Nix!
Is he the Puritan?
Yes! Yes!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
You could still help me do that.
No!
Hello?
Bob, it's me.
Ok.
You'll do it?
Two years.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Ok.
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
It's Charlotte.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Did I scowl at you?
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Oh.
You're possessive.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
No, yes, it does...
But, I'm mean.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
It's for my daughter.
Nice one.
You think so?
Where's your husband?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
I'm going to miss you.
Charlotte?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Thanks.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Oh?
Mr. Harris?
I don't think so.
My stockings.
Yes?
Lydia?
Hello?
Bob?
That's not what I'm talking about.
What are you talking about?
Fine.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
I guess she's busy.
Excuse me?
Hospital?
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
How'd it go today?
You wanna come?
Sure.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
See you later.
Do you think it's done?
Its bad for you.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Lauren?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I can't believe Will killed him.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I don't know.  What are they?
I found them in your file box.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
What a...jerk!
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
What is it?
Something he said, just before...
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Two negatives always make a positive.
May I help you?
Peter Kelson?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
So...what did you think of the tape.
We need to talk.
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
You okay?
When's your birthday?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
We're going to do this.
No oxygen to the brain.
Plenty of time.
He was trying to tell me something.
Good seeing you again.
I know who he is.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You don't want to face it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Yeah.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
What's the matter with you?
He could see me.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Parents died?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
I can't eat before a game.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Hi.
Need any help?
How is he?
Engaged.
To that stewardess?
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't curse.
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
Okay.
He's fine.
Careful.
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Wait...
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I don't wanna see that.
Nah.
To do what you love.
That too tight?
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I found you someone.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
This brother from my college.
He's in college?
How'd you get him to say yes?
Oh, great.
You ever been in love?
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
You lost your head.
I know.  But chances are...
You shoot like a girl.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
You were trying to make me look bad.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
One, up.
For real?
Your Dad play?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
Kay.
For how long?
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
That's it, give it your best shot.
With a jacked-up attitude.
I don't.
Hey.
Hey.
You having fun?
He ain't Spalding.
Mulholland Drive.
Four.
What was that about?
Yeah.
You do see me standing here, right?
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
I...can't.
Who was that?
Nobody.
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey.
Hey, what's up.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
Can we talk?
Least she had time for me.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
Least you got your priorities straight.
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Funny.  I never did.
Actually, I don't...
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Why do you keep asking me that?
Cause I don't get it.
What's going on?
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
I'll play you.
You're out of your mind.
Hey, girl.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
With who?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Not great.
Nona, please.
What is this?
Okay.
Still the man.
Where's your dad?
You scared me.
Sorry.  You okay?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
What people?
Tell me what?
What are you doing here?
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
What do you want?
No.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
You smell like trouble --
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You ok?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Uh-huh.
What kind of Cancer?
Brain and Lung.
It was scary though.
It's a helluva disease.
...what the fuck is this...?
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
OPEN THE DOOR.
Did you hear what I said?
No.
You just move in here?
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Yeah.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Just Jim.
yeah, good, ok.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Please, yes.
Really?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Great, bye.
I'm sorry.
ok.
Can I tell you something?
It's ok.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
please, what is it, please --
You live alone?
Yes.
Claudia.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Ready to go,go,go?
Cynthia?
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
Can you hold it?
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Put the gun down, please, boy.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
How much you pay me for my help?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
I ain't fuckin with you --
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
Did you listen to me?
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
....do you know who I am?
What?
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
What is that?
Braces.
You don't need braces.
Yes I do.
And how much is braces?
I've been a good worker --
Give me your keys, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Do you wanna sit down?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
You do?
...ah...
No.
Get a girlfriend.
I've seen it before.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
Do me a personal favor --
Go fuck myself?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Who?
No.
...Lily...?
No.
Alright.  Thank you.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's all important --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Around here.
the valley?
Why does that sound silly?
Well I guess it doesn't.
She's retired.
Are you close?
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
And your father?
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
From '84 to '89.
Psychology major?
...this close...
Where does that name come from?
What name?  My name?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
How long have you taken care of him?
For six months.  I'm the day nurse...
When did he go off chemo?
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
Calm down.
What does it look like?
No.  I said that.
Are you lyin' to me?
I preffer to stand.
I don't know a loud crash.
No.
--- What was that?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
All your other fluzzies?
I won't.
What happend to you?
Are you ok?
I need you to get me Paula --
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I can't fuckin' do this.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
I'm drinking.
Slowly or quickly?
As fast as I can.
-- did she talk to you?
I love you.
Love you too..
I don't think I want that.
It'll take the pain away.
You're my handsome man.
Will that help?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Yes.
Who?
Rose, I don't --
hey.
How long with Ellen?
Just once.
How long with Paula?
Two years...three years...
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Well maybe.
I love you so much.
I think that you know.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
I really don't know.
I don't know what I've done.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
She's asleep.
Are you her boyfriend?
Yes.  What's your name?
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
Hang up the phone.
Hello.
Phone number.
818-753-0088.
Partridge?
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
mmm.hmm.
Water.
Do you have that?
I don't have regular classes anymore.
The fuck is wrong with you?
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
C'mon, man.
You're late, not me.
You coulda been in front --
Go to it, handsome.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Stand up.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
..sorry...
What is that?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
God smiled upon us.
No, M'lady.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
My Queen...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
He is your brother!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
What is that?
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Those can be adopted --
Three days.
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Now.  You were saying?
But -- what is he doing?
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
He seeks redemption.
So what has changed?
Then to the Bastille.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
You can't do it.
Pull them back!
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
Forgiveness.
It is also a place of burial.
What use am I?
We go someplace dangerous.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
D'Artagnan!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
I know.
Get out of my way.
Where are you going?
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
How did you know -- ?
Whose rooms are those?
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
At least help Raoul.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty...?
It shall be done, your Majesty.
I was told this impostor was dead!
... You knew you had a double?
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Where is Michelle?
... The ball... Continue.
Phillippe!
You dead yet?
Food, moron.
Magnificent valor...
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Exactly why it should be given away.
Raoul... is in love...
The food doesn't please you?
You would do that, your Majesty?
Captain Doyle?
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
Yeah?
Where are you?
We're by Ozone...
You set to go -
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
Let's roll -
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Gotta come from somewhere...
Alright, where is she?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Are you alright?
I was just having a little fun -
And where the hell is Marvosa?
He said he was following up some lead.
Captain?
Up north.
Where up north?
What's going on here?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
No.  A witness.
I had it all on tape...
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Jesus, man...
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I've got a better idea...
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Are you a regular there?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
It was you who did the asking.
Could he handle a direct contact?
How long do I have?
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Where?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
No.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You look all right now.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
As long as they're dead...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
You said the guy down here is good.
See? You do know something about him.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Wait, Will...
I'll pick you up in...
When are you coming back?
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There's no connection between the families.
What?
That's why the boltcutter.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
Have him peel the top label back.
Will...?
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Where the hell's Graham!
He went to the men's room.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Tonic will be fine.
Is that you. D?
Yes, are you okay...?!
No. Reba...?
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Me.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Was I in an accident?
What am I doing here?
Do you feel privileged?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Do you see?
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Please, no.
'No' what?
Not me.
You'll let me go now?
Come in.
Dr. Chilton.
Do you have it?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Linda King's desk.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
No. I can help you.
I don't understand.
Do you know something about that?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
He's right-handed.
Most people are.
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
I call him a monster.
What did he want?
What the hell can I do?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
To do what?
Blue, then.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You haven't smoked in two years.
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Mama was probably asleep.
I want to see you, too.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
What's that?
Meet point's up ahead!
Go on to the house.
Are you George Sherman?
Yes. Who are you?
My name's Will Graham. I...
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
We don't know that.
She got all right?
And Hobbs died?
Did you get my card?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes, I thought so.
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
Yes.
Pictures?
Do you dream much, Will?
What were the yards like?
I want your opinion.
May I keep the file?
You got it.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Tank you veddy much.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Andy?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
I can't move my arm.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Andy!
Five.
Twenty!
Ten.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Popcorn?
Hi... am I late?
Popcorn?
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
It's me.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You don't know the real me.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
You're not listening to me --
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
GET OFF!
Then your father's a wimp.
Then your father's a wimp.
I'm gonna quit.
Each show is worse than the next.
Give me the book.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Excuse me, Andy...
Are you sure?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Er, yes.  Speaking.
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Where?
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
What's your name?
Then the informant is real.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
We'll need a search running.
You don't know.
And you are?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
What?!
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Did you hear that?
There's something about him, isn't there?
Hello, Trinity.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
He had an accident.
... yes.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Is that...?
Why you're here?
Five.  Since I've been here.
What happened to them?
Dead.  All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
I got you.
Yes.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
Give me your phone.
They'll be able to track it.
What is he doing?
How long?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Who's coming for me?
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
But what if...?
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
No.
Why do my eyes hurt?
For what?
How did I beat you?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
Do you understand, Neo?
Set down in there.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
The beginning?
And she knows what?  Everything?
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
That vase.
Who are you?
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
Of what?
They're watching you, Neo.
What the hell is this?!
From what?
Uh-oh...
God...
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
Is it?
Are you worried?
Should I be?
What did she tell you?
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
We can't leave him!
Is Morpheus alive?
What are you doing?
You can't!
Why?
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
See who?
What are they doing to him?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Operator.
We need an exit!
You're not far from Cypher.
Tank, you're hurt.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Know where he is?
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
That means it's good.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well the guy over there said...
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Yeah.
I gotta get the stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
Uh...can we give you a check?
May God be with you.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Look at her.
Where to?
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Nervous?
Yeah.
You flew before?
And say what?
Panther...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
You got some mouth!
Drinks for everybody Tony...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Hey...you got nothing here.
Don't come any closer!!!
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Back so soon.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Michael, give us a lift.
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
C'mon Johnny.
You getting out too?
How much?
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Where's the rest?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Take a drink!
Hey, where you been?
Well, maybe you missed something?
What was it?
"Francis Macomber."
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Please take it.
Well...
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.
What is it now?
Did you?
You're intolerable today.
You know why...with my parents.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
The girls like it loud.
What's the matter with this kid?
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Hey... you got stereo.
I know...I know.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
You mean it's heisted.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Just keep him quiet.
How much?
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Sure.
Look who's talking.
He's coming.
Just plain 'Joe'?
That was 'Joe'.
He's cute.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
I know you do, darling.
From the Korean War.
What is this?
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
That you've been to Susan?
Yeah, but --
What do you do that for?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Red or white?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What are you eating.
Hello, Beautiful.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Well... goodnight.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Thank you for coming.
Here...
Why yes, thank you.
Hot or cold.
Cold.
Yes.
What an odd pairing.
Of whom?
May I interrupting?
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
A voice?
In my sleep.
What'd it say?
It's going to be great --
I'm all excited --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
'Joe...'
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
No.
'Just kidding'?
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
Well, I guess he's found one.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Yeah, that's what he said.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
What you then?
No, no.  I on holiday.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Make it go 'way.
Not time yet.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Yes.
My Doctor Lady?
Yah.
You loved back?
She knows you real self?
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Thanks.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
You love Allison, don't you?
You think so?  How do you know?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't have any.
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Very well, I'll watch.
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
And I'll be a visitor.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I appreciate you --
I mean I appreciate that.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I am, too.
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
Gay?
Where are you going?
To bed.
'To bed'?
I love your smell.
Thank you.
You're here?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Where are you going?
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
We know so little about each other --
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
What will we do?
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
Susan --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
How long have I got?
Not at all.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
Sounds fair enough.
It is a deal?
Bill --
Joe --?
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
What's it like?
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Why didn't you stop me?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Dinner?  Absolutely.
I don't know.
You were just curious?
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
Okay.  Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Uh --
You are?
What the hell do you care?
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I don't like what you're saying.
I don't expect you to.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I told you to shut up.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An offense --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
You are --?
Yes.
Death!
I do?  How long will you be staying?
It just occurred to me --
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I didn't ask any question.
I think you know --
What are you talking about?
Are you giving me orders?
It's enough now.
What do you mean?!
I think you know --
Where are you?
Get what?
Watch it!
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
How're you doing--?
Yeah, I give a shit.
You think Drew will go for it?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Good morning, Dad.
How did you know?
Drew told me.
Does Drew tell you everything?
I hope so.
You like him, don't you?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Do you love Drew?
Don't get carried away.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Bravo.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
We've met.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
It'll come back, Daddy.
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
What a night.
Are you relieved?
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
What's the way?
Nothing lasts.
I've got to go --
69.
That's it?
I'm sorry... um... ?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't my room?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
Where'd you get it?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
You think you can bargain with me?!
Take the money and walk away!
So you have information for me?
Deals?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
They treating you alright?
Sleep okay?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
Did you?
Kill him.
His name was Jimmy.
What are you gonna do?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I told him about your car.
What's wrong?
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Calls himself Dodd.
Did you?
Neither do I.
Don't protect him.
I'm not.
Help me.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't say another fucking word!
On the house.
My wife.
Sweet.
Dying.
Beer, please.
What do you want?
What are you here for?
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
You're the memory guy?
How do you know about me?
Who's your boyfriend?
Are you Teddy?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Did Teddy send you?
I'm not appealing the decision.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
This is your car.
Yup?
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
You don't know him?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Natalie? Natalie who?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What's wrong with this one?
Who the fuck are you?
Teddy. Your buddy.
What do you mean "bad news"?
She has no idea who I am.
You're not coming?
This is a drug deal?!
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
It makes all the difference.					 *
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Somehow, I'll know!
No. You took them out.						  *
It is now.
Yeah.
Turn around.
And...?
Sal Maguda.
He any good?
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
What do you think?
We're not certain...
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
I don't know.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
My end?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 40%.
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
It goes very fast.
So where's the best place for mojitas?
The Keys?
Where's she now?
Later!  Do you dance?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Is it December?
What do you mean?
Hola, chica.
I forgot the napkins.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Would you find me...?
Of course.
No part of it wasn't real.
What is it?
Alonzo...
Stevens?
Anything?
Where we meeting 'em...?
What do we got?
Where the hell are you, man?
Where?
Verdado.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Twenty on my man...
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
So what do you want?
Yeah...?
Sonny...?
Where's Riccardo?
On the phone.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You okay?
Yeah.
Okay...see you soon.
What's it say?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
That sonofabitch!
What do you care?
Then what were we talking to you for?
This the load you lost a while back?
Alonzo...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
I ain't sleepy.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
For what?
For money.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Tell her, Ratso.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
And what?
I'm scared.
These guys're good drivers.
They gotta be.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
I'm wet.
What d'you want?
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Ready for hard work, son?
You got it.
Sold. Let's go.
Getchmis olsun
Two kilos.
It's there!
What?
Want me to take over?
What?
How's your hernia?
Who?
Shit.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Where'd you get that limp?
Where you staying, Dad?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
DAD!
Sure.
How far?
Sixty Lira?
I'll pay extra
Would you recognize him again?
But just...
...are you with the Consulate?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Got a family back there?
What's your father do?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
What they give you?
How much did you have?
A hundred grams.
How long?
Hello, Billy.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Okay?
Yeah!
What time is it?
We go back.
After we're outside the kogus?
I want to cut his throat.
It's already been cut.
Hishradyo.
Why the suit?
Never was anybody like you...
Billy, what's the matter?
My passport!
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
That's a great philosophy.
Work, work, work, that's all do
His name?
Hey, you can't...
What's your name?
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Peter...
Weird shit...?
And a right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Oh, that's gonna work.
I only got...
Its muscles are locked.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
The kid...
What do you-?
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Please.
Do you think we did the right thing?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Honey, just leave it.
I heard how you talked to him.
He was just doing his job.
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
What-
Peter-
It worked before...
Your arm, you can't...
C'mon...
Ah...
Talk to me.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
It bit you.
My God.
What do you want to know?
Here.
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
The profanity bothers you?
Thank you so much.
I'm...
Done?
Yeah, thanks.
I DIDN'T...
Then light the match, Paul.
No big deal.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
I want my pills NOW!
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
I can't write this anymore.
I'm telling you, I can't.
What?
Have to wait.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Well, it certainly says you.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
Be my guest.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
I'm glad you like it.
What things?
Yes, Paul.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Just leave it, all right?
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
Hey, Pete.
Answer me a couple things?
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Did they win?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I thought you were over it.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I thought you were going to dinner.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Magic...
Your room.
Mmmm.
You won.
To win?
You picked another winner!
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
What are you talking about?
Fight a bit of a cold..
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
It is, Billy.
We're due to take off.
There she is.  I got visual.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Do you know me?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Uh-huh.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
I wouldn't do that.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
What's you name?
Care to wait a decent interval?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
They've got a book for this?
Which is?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Much.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times.
Just like old times?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
An idea, yeah.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I don't.  No exactly.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
That simple, huh?
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket?
Roger that.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
She must still be on the property.
So what did he say?
A visit from an old friend.
You have Bellerophon.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
To friends.
That's S.O.P..
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
All ten million.
Is he serious?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
We got it.  On your feet.
I'm walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
The message is for Job.
Max made a deal with you?
I didn't say that.
Kittridge...
Is this the only way?
Two cars.  Where are you?
This is Kittridge.
Go ahead.
Theyíre dead.
No sir.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Yes.  I see your point.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Information.
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
That depends.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
IMF mainframe.
Zero body count.
We'll see.
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack.  Jack.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Higher.  Higher.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
The package is in the open.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
You're going to use Walter?
Iíve got a shadow.
Can you lose him?
Abort.  Thatís an order.
Whatís going to make him do that?
Youíre probably right.
You got it.
And get a doctor.
Loud and clear.
That's what we do isn't it?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Yes...  Itís him.
Whatís the problem.
Connection denied.
Try it again.
I always check the batteries.
No, I'm going.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Thank you, Rose.
Hi.  Hi.
You haven't said anything.
Where's Ma?
Bed.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Ti amo.
You look tired.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
The guy died.
In a month.
He did?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
Why didn't he call himself?
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Yes.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
I have no life.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Loretta. What's that smell?
I'm making you a steak.
You don't have to help me.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Why?
Why what?
No.
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You think so?
What are you doing!
Stop it!
A bride without a head!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
Me neither.
I was dead.
What?
I've never seen a moon like that.
Oh my God.
I'm marrying your brother!
She didn't like me.
You don't get along with anybody!
What did I do?
I can't do that!
Snap out of it!
I'll come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
Who painted that?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Thank you!
They get some turnout for this stuff.
No thanks.
It's really cold.
How can you ask me that?
You're making me feel guilty again.
He didn't come!
You're late!
This is your place.
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
I was.
Is Johnny here?
You've gotta get outta here.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Loretta?
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You never have dessert.
Have Something.
I shouldn't.
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
What time is it?
How near is she to death?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
What?
No.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Hi.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What! How do you know?
What the hell happened to you?
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
What? He's in Sicily!
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
What about the moon?
No.
He should pay.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
So.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
That's incredible.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That's it! That's the reason!
Loretta...
Have you come to make peace with me?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Thanks, comrade.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Sorry. That was rude.
That woman was a student of yours?
Temperature's dropping.
No.
I'm freezing
That's my house.
He's a plumber.
Rita. Rita.
What? What?
Look.
Oh.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Yes!
You're using coconuts!
Where did you get the coconuts?
What do you mean?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Please!
Am I right?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
King of the WHO?
The Britons.
I am your king!
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
NI!
Oh!
All right!  What do you want?
One that looks nice.
Of course.
Yes ...
You said it again!
None shall pass.
What?
I move for no man.
'Tis but a scratch.
No, it isn't.
Well, what's that then?
I've had worse.
Come on then.
Course I have.
Stop that.
Had enough ... ?
You'll what ... ?
I'm invincible!
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
What is your name?
Ni!
What with?
There!  Look!
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings King Arthur.
A G...g...g...
Too late.
What?
Where?
There.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
Je...sus Christ!
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
I'm thirty-seven.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Good idea, O Lord!
I feel fine.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your quest?
To seek the Grail!
What is the capital of Assyria?
Bring out your dead!
Here's one!
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Well taken, Concorde!
Did you kill all those guards?
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
But, Mother ...
Rather what?
Listen, Alice ...
Who are you?
I'm ... your son ...
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Leaving the room.
Yes?
No ... just keep him in here.
Until you, or anyone else ...
The Prince ... ?
Where are you going?
Well, look er, I ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Oh ... hello ...
Quick!
Well, she's got a point.
We'll cover your escape!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No.  It's unhealthy.
... I Bet you're gay.
Sir Gawain.
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
You've come to rescue me?
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, father.
They're all saying the word ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Brave, Sir Rob ...
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
I didn't.
Bravely ran away, away.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
I speak as I find, Archie.
How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
You know what I mean.
What are you doing?!
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll be worried about me.
Aye.
What's this?
It's a diary.
Be careful who sees it.
The place is a mess.
I can't move to tidy.
What's your name?
Checked and locked, sir.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
It's the Queen's decision.
She's busy.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Whom you address.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
Checked and locked, sir.
How will I know what she requires?
You'll be sent a message.
Who'll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Do you?
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I'm fine.
You're injured.
I'm not married.
I wouldn't know.
Was there never ambition?
Maybe, once.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
They don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
Mr Brown.
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
You are well?
I am.
And the pony?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Aye, ma'am.
What are those?
Those, over there, there.
Are they worth reading?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
What does he know about the Highlands?
We took a nip of whiskey.
What is it, John?  John?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
John?
Ma'am?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
What can we do?
Then they may read about me.
Should we take it seriously?
The question is, do we need her?
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
Who?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Where did you find it by the way?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Just them?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
A few days, ma'am.
Read it.
Who told them that?
I have no idea.
There is one other matter.
What is it?
Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Hello?
We are talking...
No, in person.  Now.
It's twelve-thirty!
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Where to now?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
It's already out.
Then where do we go?!
SLIP-STREAM.
You mean we learn the rules...
You're not coming, Alex.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
One.  In case...
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
The clock's already ticking.
Our time's up.
What?!  There's nothing here!
We can't reach that!
Christ...no time...
And then keep on driving?
Go for it.
So how did you do it, Alex?
Yes...
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
I'm thinking!
Mom?  You're alive...
Of course I am.
So how do I start?
So what do you think?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...
Adam, where are you?
What did you say?
They fired everyone.
Someone's shut off my money!
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You're broke!
Cynthia...what's going on?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
So what's the problem?
Howdy!
Beautiful night.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
I understand.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's unbelievable!
I told ya.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Your Aunt called me.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Right. See ya.
A car ... a car accident.
Betty Elms?
No. I can't.
Yes?
Diane?
Number 17.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
But, this could be serious.
I don't know who I am.
Mulholland Drive.
No. Just the coffee.
Strange to be calling yourself.
Maybe it's not me.
What's wrong with that?
"Before I kill you."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
What is it? What do you see?!
Do you know them?!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
This Denny's.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
Yeah, they showed me
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Where at?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Not here...no thanks.
No.  I haven't seen any.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Is that it ?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
What's going on ?
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Now where do we go ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Come on, it works.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
What are you doing ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
What's the trick here ?
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
I wanted to let his family know....
You okay ?
Where are we going ?
What was that ?
I work here, remember ?
That's a shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Is it over ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
What's next Walt ?
Be very, very quiet...
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
What the fuck are you talking about.
You okay ?
Knock yourself out.
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
Not yet.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
When I think you're ready.
When will that be ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Fire the whole division.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
How long till the drug wears off ?
What is Bruce doing ?
What the ... ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
Hi. I brought some wine.
What an incredible view !
Not now, Mom.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
What ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
How did you know my name?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
What about giving the other guy a break.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Okay, no problem.
Well you know what I mean.
Seriously?
Seriously.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Thanks, I needed that.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Yeah.
Totally groovy huh?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
How about a nice glass of milk?
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Oh.  Ohhh?
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
I'm glad you're here.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Hi.
Come on in!
That's okay.
My mother can't have any more kids.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
What's the matter?
Is it okay if I drink this?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
This is really very nice of you.
Hi there...can I help you?
My mother.
Give it back Nicholas!
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
There's water in your bathroom.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
What if you don't wanna be found?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You ratted on my mother??
I think it's cool.
And I thought I was weird.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
Just give it to me!!
Woah, watch it!
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
My mother stood on this very spot.
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Nick?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
An adventure?

I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
What's that?
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
Lock the door.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
Then you'll be all set.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
He was caressing.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
She'll be all right baby.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing at all.
I was commenting on your hair.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Good morning.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
Is there milk in them already?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Why not now?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
It would be fantastic.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
He's a great poet.
He is?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
You're such a baby.
Danny?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
No.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
It's still available I hope?
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Stiffs??
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I wrote that.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
Dance with me?
This is where we are.
I haven't danced in.....
Do you want to?
Want to what?
Kiss me.
Yes.
I ahh, better go.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Pointing upwards Look...
VADA!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad??
What?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
She likes to play bingo.
When?
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
I'm very nervous.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Sure.
Thank you. Bye.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
This is one big house for one single person.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
How much does it cost?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
I paid the money.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Cause she's dying.
She's shy.
Who's winning?
He won't give it to me.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Can we look around in your camper?
I would.
Uh huh.
What are they about?
Are you married?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Uh huh, why?
I won, I won!!!
NO!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
How old are you?
I think it should be outlawed.
Goodnight.
Thomas J?
I'm allergic to it.
I knew he wouldn't come.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
No, I'm going home.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Oh no!  UUH.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
It's a mosquito bite.
Uh huh.
Your lip bleeding?
No, I don't wanna.
Hmmmm, interesting.
You have no personality.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What?
Here.
Don't DO that!!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
I am not.
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Woah!!
So?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Jump in the water!!
Hi Vada.
Come on, let's go.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
So now you'll have a mother.
I don't like her.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
Leave then, some friend you are.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Uh huh.
But, I don't know how.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Just do it.
Umm, Ummmmm
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
You don't miss much.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
You think...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
You have a real philosophy of life.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
I was devastated.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Someday she'll thank you.
Zit cream?
I wish.
Neosporin?
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
Major.  Dish.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
But he sure can kiss.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
But he always says...
Exactly.
He'll see right through it.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I think he's been fired.
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Please come, please.
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Waiter! Check, please!
Should I whistle down a cab?
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
I never eat when I'm serene.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Big weddings are so strange.
You miss her, huh?
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
I'm up against a deadline.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
What happened?
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
And your point?
I asked you...
What's up?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Lower.
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
It's two weeks.
It's not just a gag, huh?
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
You got the money?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
Winifred.
I won first prize.
You're from out of town?
Is there food?
Barnett, please -
Don't feel that way, honey.
Barnett?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You going today?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
That's what he wants.
You know better than that.
Well, how about the shopping center?
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Whose?
National television?
ABC.
How much?
Okay.
Bastard
President?
You're kidding.
Where are you going?
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Well, Mr. Green.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. I need a room
He is just wonderful.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
What's this?
Replacement party.
You must really like him.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
You got a place to stay?
You in music?
No.
What kind?
Nash.
What year?
Nashville.
Next you'll be sick.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
About three years.
Do you like him?
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm here.
Who is this?
Tom. You remember?
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Hello.
Who is thin?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Hello.
Wow!
Stay.
I can't.
Older.
Thirty?
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
That's what you said before.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
They said go see the chaplain.
Hello.
Linnea?
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
I can do benefits
For him?
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Bill?
Oh?
I mean...
How long have you been together?
Probably a little too long.
Do you study at all?
Come on.
Hi.
Hello.
Why?
Pleasure
You go to school together?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
Southern California.
Ah... Peter Finch.
You sure do it loud.
Is that good?
You think I should take lessons?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Oh, why thank you.
What kind of pies do you have?
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Are we in a big hurry?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey!
Lobotomy Bay?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
How come you never talk?
She was born without a tongue.
Say something.
What?
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
How is it?
You ready, Donut?
Ready.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Not to anybody. She sings.
I'm sure we will.
Says the United States of America.
I could go for a Coke.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
No fuckin' way!
I admire them.
Through the power of the simple word---
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
It's hard to say Capt'n.
The entire wing?
That's my opinion.
How immediate is immediately?
Roger?
Rockin'!
Who?
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Waitin' in the lounge.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Rollin'...and speed!
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Where' you goin'?
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
See Duff. He's the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Yeah.
Where was that?
She done moved to Detroit.
They say your dad's 'round town.
People seen him 'round.
Where's he at?
Name's Duff.
How 'you doing?
Don't say much, do you?
Guess so.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
His profession?
Well, he worked around.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Oh yeah?
You work around town?
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
How about another beer?
Hell!
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
You almost got into trouble back there.
No, on the porch.
Ain't your fault.
That's the way he is.
Just for the day?
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
That's right.
Four.
What?
Your boy.
Okay, I guess.
Thank you.
How about it?
I can see why.
What about him?
Is that so?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Hmmm - good coffee.
You know how to box?
My kids want me to teach them.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I don't want to hurt you.
Don't look so scared.
You jivin' me?
I keep thinking about him.
Don't, Duff.
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
There's nothing to say.
Okay.
Where' you goin'?
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
How 'bout the key?
We was just leavin', fellows.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Good-bye, Frankie.
'See ya.
I'm Duff.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
I asked you somethin', boy!
That's right.
Couldn't get the words out before.
Better get him to a hospital.
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Going back, huh?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
Who is?!
Hello.
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Let's stay here, Will.
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
I ain't drunk, honey.
Got a thick feelin' here.
What's the matter now?
Let's go.
How long's it been?
We got any shots?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
No. I only needed the code from you.
What about her?
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Alright. Let's talk business.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
You ran without us.
Did you trace it?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
You've got your orders.
Tell me the words.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
I saw your girl yesterday.
I don't have a girl.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Jah guides us.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
Where the hell have you been?
How much time you got left?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
You're late.
It's coming.
Case... are you okay?
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Couple of months.
What about before that?
Maybe something's onto him.
How soon is soon enough?
On a good run... yeah.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
It sounds like you.
...Feels like you.
Case...
Case... it's four a.m.
Yeah... fine.
Case... Are you alright?
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Is he going to make it?
I'm still going in.
Get up.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What?
Thanks.
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
YOU DID.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
You're Pam?
Roger in Op/Ed.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Now this is cute.
Bridgework?
Hi!
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Transitioned?
He is totally crunching on you.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Five-- Six--
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
But I don't want it straightened out.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Do you even know these kids?
Oh my god.
Hey there.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Do you remember high school?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Is that true?
Better than I...
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thanks. And what are -
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
So what are you thinking for college?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
This seat taken?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Yoooooow.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Do you think you'll find her?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Yes.
Why?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
We followed your instructions.
Shock.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Not at all!
Yes.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Coming...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
No.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Where are you going?
Oh, come on Dad...
Help me with this thing!
It's not the gas, Dad!
Come back here!
Jesse, help!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
What?
How come?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
You okay?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You know her?
I think it's sad...
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
So, you feeling anything?
Any ghosts in here?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I feel like a jerk.
About not finding any bogey men?
Whoa!
It's gone now.
yeah, I had a bad night.
Why won't you talk to me?
Jesse, God - what happened?
Hi.
'Morning.
Jess?
Huh?
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Hi, guys.
Yor dad picking the music again?
You're going out?
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Good morning, Jennifer.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Horseshit.
I know who's trying to kill you.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
What's happening?
Do you still...see each other?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
You got five minutes.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Ms. Thompson.
You're late.
Didn't get much sleep.
This is nice.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
To who?
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
You sound like Peter Pan.
We can try again.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
How do we get in?
We've got work to do.
What was that?
What?
Science...I suppose.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
How is he?
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
I'm in.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
I'm a vegetarian.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
God, that's an enormous arse.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Oh Jesus.
No thanks.
Coffee?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
I forgot my bag.
Here we go.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Hi.
Okay.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
She left me.
She saw through me.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
I have thought about you.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Eleven.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
You've got big feet.
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
You and every person in this country.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
What?
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Hi.
Hello.
Yes...
Excuse me.
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He's bringing a girl?
That's right.
Yes.
The movie star?
... get fired.
Still loves you though.
In a depressingly asexual way.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Is this your first film?
Working with Leonardo.
Da Vinci?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
What happened?
Still, not sparkling.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
What's your name?
Mr. Thacker?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Ah... yes, enormously.
I did.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Martin -- your customer.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
Well?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Hey.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Try 'Flintstone.'
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Which floor?
Yes.
How was she?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Bad news.
But you have no proof.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
M-m-m-ma'am?
Would you like to start?
Y-y-y-yes...
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Who? Tell me!
Get up, Billy.
Will you come with me, please.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry to have bothered you.
I wanna report a robbery!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yes, ma'am?
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Gotta go now, ma'am...
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Whatcha boys playin'?
What's your name, buddy?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
So long, kid.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
H-Hey, M-Mack.

Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!

Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!

There they are!

I'll bet a dollar.
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
What for?
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
With your own two hands?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Giving up?
I'm busting outta this place.
What's your plan, Mack?
I refuse!
I said out!
No!
I just started!
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Gimme a cigarette!
No!
Big king, too bad...
Who told you that?
Can you borrow me a dime?
'Kay, place your bets.
What's this?
Bet a nickel!
Right!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!

Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
He's not!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
You bet, Doc!
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Time out!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Are you a doctor?
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
How do ya know that?
Because I quit breathing.
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
Somebody's coming!
A dime.
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Okay. How you doing?
What are they?
You know, I never got your name.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
He's a patient, Rose...
Oh, yeah...
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Who is he?
He's in charge.
Hi.
Yeah!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Huh?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Bet!
Bet you ass...
What kind of crap is that???
Evenin', ma'am.
Is everything all right?
What happened?
What?
I thought so.
He is your husband, no?
She was your sister.
Your mother.
Of course not.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
Why?
So, what's the story with your friend?
Who's dying?
I'm a liberal!
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
...has a prior commitment.
We'll KNOW.
You...
Congratulations.
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Why can't you just tell me?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
You didn't answer my question.
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
Mickey Spillane?
Hi, Peter.
Oh.  That's nice.
And she's a knock-out, too.
What?
What are you doing here?
How about music?  You like classical?
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Yes.  I am.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
What would you call it?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Been here long?
Tonight?
Any night.
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't believe in statistics.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Scientologist.
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
Is he married?
No.
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
No.  He's never asked me.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
But it's July.
It's still the new year...
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Ah ha!...
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
We're saved!
What is it?
Only what?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Faith--
Like a detective.
Hi-iii...
Hi.  Where've you been?
It was a ouija board, remember?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
Kate is that you?
And Larry?...
And you are?...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Giovanni.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
And you didn't tell her?
She's not here.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Don't say that!
What the hell!!!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
What happened?  What happened?
Terry...?
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
What makes him so special?
I think we're O.K.
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
They play pretty rough.
Which side are you with?
I'll get home all right now.
You know how the Sisters are.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
What for?
I don't know.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
How do you like that one?
Listen, you like beer?
How do you like it?
It's quite—  –nice.
How about another one?
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What a fruitcake you are!
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I don't rate it.
Edie... Edie... ..
Who says?
Terry— what's happening to you?
I just told the Father.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Terry, for God's sake.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
You are like—
But you've got to listen to me.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
You can!
You still call it ratting?
Are you on the level, Father?
Down to the wire?
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Really?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
I told you lay off.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
Is Johnny in?
No.
Give me a double.
Take it easy now, Terry.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Not a dent.  Perfect
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
You got some nerve.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Keep Charley out of this.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
In there.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
I'm not sure...
Don't let them hear you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I am--It's our only chance.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
You love me then?
...And what is this?
A symbol, Master.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
The moon is almost gone!
There are others.
The time...is short.
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
Is there time?
You better hope there is.
They are live ones?
Live ones where only the dead should be?
You know better than that.
We don't know of anything, Master...
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
He wants us.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Yes, it is.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
You didn't visit him in prison.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Nice disguise.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
And she saw you?
You find out?
You know they gonna set us up.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Come <i>on</i>.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
Hello, Daniel.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You get the key?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
What do you want to bet?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Ironic, isn't it?
How are you, Raymond?
Karen, I told you not to--
How much for your company at chow?
You know how to use one a these?
Not until recently.
Nervous?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Buddy.  That's his given name?
That's funny.
You don't seem all that scared.
Uh-huh.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Really.
I mean, romantically.
How'd you get this number?
Who was it answered the phone?
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Don't leave me.
You like bourbon?
Is that how you think of yourself?
I don't have a problem with it.
You did?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Where?
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Take your sunglasses off.
In the trunk?
Whose blood you got all over you?
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
When?
Looks like tonight.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
It works.  You should try it sometime.
What's to think about?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Foley?  That you?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
There were others.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Gee, I wonder why not.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Gimme another hint.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
What-- when?
You're a fighter?
How you know that?
I can tell.
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
What do you want?
No.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Here?  In this house?
Your dog was killed?
It's beautiful.
He's still married though, huh?
Technically.  They're separated.
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
What'd I say?
"Hey, yourself."
He's pretty laid back, confident.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
I didn't have time.
You gonna go get him?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
You here all by yourself?
How do I look, mama?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Faux goose down.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Foley's got it.
We have a problem here?
...the fuck is this...
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
Are you sure they're here?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.
Do you always stutter?
You're Walker, right?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Where's that lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
A m-missionary?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Land of the free...
Home of the brave!
How could you do this?
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
We gotta face some facts here.
I was grieving too.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
What's there?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Land of the free.
I'm out of ammo!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
I can't make it.
Well...sure.
So beautiful!
No baseball diamonds, Red.
I heard what you did.
We can explain, Colonel.
Our doctor's gone too.
Boxin'.
Win?
What's your name?
You take care, Dorie.
Oh, this is Betty.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
Hello, Lilla!
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Let's go.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
I can't. It's all too much.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
How do you feel?
You drive like a maniac!
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'm sorry Charlie.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
What am I going to do with you?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I love you.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
Come back to me.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
I'll never give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Are you for real?
Terry, slow down.
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
What're you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
I can't do that.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
It's Charlie!
At my age? Don't be silly.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
For me?
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I have a note.
How do you feel?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
What about?
Would you get that, dear?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
For what?
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
What are you doing?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Don't eat the red ones.
I remember that dress.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
What was?
Dancing with you.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Hi, Richard.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Wait! I'll go with you!
That's Renee alright.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
So where're we going?
What's his name?
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Is this a good spot?
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
It's weird...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Are we interrupting, Andy?
In a word, Bob...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What was the file name?
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're going to the office?!
One hour!
Drew!
What's wrong with you?
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm ready...
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
I know that, Charles.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
About my blood work?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
New baby?
One week old.
Congratulations.
Little baby girl.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
Nine.
My lover and I.
I buy that.
Who'd you get?
What?
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
What's her name?
Rayisha.
They didn't fire her?
There is no relevant precedent.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
Not bad.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Correct.
Uh huh...
Beckett?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What?
I've considered that.
I know a good probate lawyer.
A regular all-American guy?
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Yes.
What?
Thanks for coming by.
Something like that.
Gay movies.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Really?
Answer the question, please.
I'm fine.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
We're going to draw blood.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
A homosexual encounter.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
You're the asshole, buddy.
How many gays do you know?
Lots.
Duh...
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Julius!
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Don't wanna miss this.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
Bring the light!
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
'Mean the whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
Back to the ship, huh?
How many you see?
One or two.
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
I can't....I can't....
Here. Make it easy on you.
Don't do this to me....
You'd die for them?
I would try for them.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
Like the light is scalding it.
How many bottles?
Can we switch?
Hey.
Hey, who?
And him?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Didn't bite.
Like what?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Well, don't ask me to.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
60 years ago.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
I never said I was.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
So you noticed too?
You know who Muhammad was?
One is all?
Hasan?
Imam. Slow down.
I would rather we all stay--
The sled as a shield....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Where's Mr. Johns?
Which half?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Very big beads.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Well, you got the big gauge.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Not if I'm the one.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
So which one caught your eye?
What's her name, anyway?
So much for your nightfall.
Take it.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
No.
Look -- she remembers.
Remembers what?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
The evidence was very meager --
Got your sensors?
Yo!
But how long is a day?
That way.
Any particular reason?
Objection!
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
I think you're making a mistake.
Who put them up?
The Hunt Club.
What is that?
One is in a museum!
ThatÕs a lie!
With one of them.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What is your proposal?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Tell him to pull back!
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Shhhh!
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Which one?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Why not?
This is his assertion.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Bunker...
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
So what's the problem?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Where's Elias come from?
Taylor! Francis!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
But what'd she actually do?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
I volunteered.
Must be somebody?
You volunteered for this shit man?
What are you talking about! 
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
I don't know.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
No thanks?
Not tonight.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Would you mind?
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
Whatever you say.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Dance?
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
You tried to run away.
Bad?
He could hardly help suspecting you.
What time is it?
Certainly not to me.
Want to dance?
Dance? Here?
Absolutely sure.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Nothing matters.
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Well?
If you're doing all this just for me.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
I think you mean that.
Do you think I was faking?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
What this?
Where's you get it?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You've had dealings with the police before?
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
To do what?
I can't answer that.
What will they do to you?
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
For five hundred, what do I get?
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
Martini.
And without much discrimination.
What's a buzzer?
Who told you my name?
What?
How's life treating you?
Round of golf Saturday?
I don't.
Time for a little chat?
Would that make me a heel?
You'd be breaking the law.
It could have been an accident.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
A little something on account perhaps?
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What are you doing here?
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Send that?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
What do I get for it?
You in charge here?
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I'll know when I find it.
Not too hard, is it?
I think so.
Where's the shell?
May you what?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
What about me?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Not if it clears the air.
No doubt about that one.
How about Magruder?
He checks too.
That leaves two strangers.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
The card says so, doesn't it?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
I don't know, sir.
Get out of here!
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks, darling.
How about your new friend?
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Shall we go?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Attributed?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
Damn.  They're early.
Very thoughtful.
In radio we're different.
I think she liked me.
I might.
Jeremy phoned this morning
That'll be fun
In your car
Not here.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
Now, top secret file.
It's shit.
You approve!
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Hello.
What period?
What about the Cromwells?
Hello, Jimmy.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Darling Susan.
What have you got there?
Promise?
I won't.  Goodnight.
Ah, Susy, it...
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Thanks for stepping in.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
You gonna pull?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You do it... you first!
You first!
I'm not armed.
You gotta tell me where she is.
Wild ride, huh?
Fine.
Surf conditions okay?
Babes.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Aw shit.
... so I started tailing him.
They're on their way to Maui.
Time for lunch.
Nothing?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
What do you want?
Who's the girl?
Catch of the day.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Look at you.
Those are cold.
Ouch.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
So what'd the other guy look like?
My name's Johnny Utah!
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
You saw what?
You're looking well, Dutch.
Hawkins?
What in God's name...?
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
Your uncle will like this.
He's not really my uncle.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
Congratulations, sir.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Nice car.  Yours?
No.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
It pays.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
For the whole night?
For an hour.
Three hundred.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Off the boulevard.
Can I have some chips?
Let's talk some more first.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
It's a very good year.
Try a strawberry.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No?  Why's that?
I buy companies.
I sell them.
What are assets?
It'd cost you.
Of course.  How much?
But you want days too.
Three.
Done.
Did you buy some clothes?
I got a dress, yeah.
The Rex.
Any good?
And that's the way the game is played.
I have work to do.
Okay.
Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
What about dinner?
You still mad at'm?
What id we run into someone I know?
Edward, I can't.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Huh?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
What did you do to him?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It was good.
Cynthia's not coming?
Oh, god, what?
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
But, Edward...
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Yes...
Doing what?
Did I wake you?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Was that you?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
It was great.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Yeah, what?
Kit give me nothin'.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Oooh, I love those.
I'm just going to my room.
You're a guest here?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
And who is that?
What's your name?
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Will I like it?
You'll like it fine.
But I always eat like this.
What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.
But what if they serve soup?
I like steak.
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
What is with you?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Should I be?
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
He knows I do not love him.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Does it bother you to hear?
But what if something happens to you?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
I will never doubt again.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We did it.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
It never happened.
What?
What do I do?
Probably he means no harm.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
It's you.
How many could you handle?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- Fezzik, please --
The body?
Have you any money?
Will this do?
Inigo.
What is it?
Oh no. No, please.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Who gets Humperdinck?
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Now?
Now?
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
Sir. Sir.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
And what is that?
Who are you?!
I must know.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Go in, get after her!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Yes.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
Then make your choice.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
Yeah, an hour.
Have fun storming the castle.
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
What?
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Honeymoon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Oooooooops!
Do the books!  Do the books!
I have hurt your feelings.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What is that?  A handkerchief?
All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
What is she gonna do here?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
No way out.  No way out.
I never should have listened to you.
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
What???
Max, I...
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Min Bialystock.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Get car.  Get car.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Oh, the best one.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
We won.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
How early?
The following morning. Sunday.
Back where?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
Let's all talk about Mary.
What's your interest?
Why?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
A lot?
Did he say anything about my sister?
I'm Mary's sister.
Lila.
With you.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
I was getting to that!
What do you know about it?
What thing?
I hate tears. 
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Sam, I'm going.
Just wait here?
Without calling me?
Our Deputy sleeps.
Watch your tenses.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Sorry.
Hospital clean.
Why not?
It's regular. Okay?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
I have to go, Sam.
Sam! No!
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Dirty night.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You eat like a bird.
Uncommon, too.
I'm looking for a private island.
What are you running away from?
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
Thank you, Norman.
Very early. Dawn.
Alright, Miss... 
Crane.
That's it. 
Then I'm free to go...?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!
Why?
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
I'll get your bags.
My mother is not dead!
...Forty thousand dollars!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
You didn't find anything.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Did she talk?
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Who are you? What is your name?
You--a friend to me?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
That's it. You get it quick.
How do you do.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What are you going to do?
What is it?
The wound is bleeding!
What is it now?
I'm losing my blood!
A voice ...
That spoke to you?
That called ... commanded ...
Your father?
Did you hear?
The child!
There's no child here.
No?
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I think so.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
So that's the way it is?
That's the way I feel about it.
We'll be coming to the opening.
What! What are you talking about?
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
And they never proved anything against him.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Now don't that call for an extra!
We'll grant that.
No kiddin'?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Call the Homicide Squad!
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
It's all yours.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Cry-baby?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
You go in for dangerous things.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
But I have some friends waiting.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
What are you laughing at?
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
What was her name?
Mia...?
I've been dreaming about you.
Could we go somewhere?
A place you've never been.
I've been dreaming about this.
Yes?
They were just bad men, that's all.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
You better quit that.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Yeah.
You won't die, Rose.
What are you going to do, Rose?
All right, what do you know?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
I think Daddy suspects.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
There goes Mother.
Wow! Brrrother!
What are they doing, Doll?
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
That's what she would say herself.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
I think we both know her.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Well, she's back.
Quarter of twelve.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
How is she?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Rose, what are you doing up?
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
Got yourself up?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
You don't know where you're going?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Mine.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
I don't believe it.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Galley proof.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Took your time gettin' here.
What's the matter with him?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you don't have to.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Indivisible and inseparable.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
What... ?
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Lay off once, would you?
You shouldn't litter.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
That wasn't my fault.
I can work this.
No you can't.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Clench your teeth.
What?
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
They... they shot me.
They shot us all, kid.
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Wha... ?
It doesn't say that.
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
I can't believe we're stealing.
You live like a pig.
You could start over again with cash like that.
There probably is.
He tried to kill us.
You can't be serious.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Arriving tonight
Alright?
We got him.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
You think this is so easy?
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Any preferences?
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Been waiting long?
Just got here.
Get his attention.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
The gang's all here!
You always did have style.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
I can't do it, Ben.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Where am I?
Han!
Are you all right?
How are we doing?
The same as always.
You got her warmed?
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I...
I'm sorry.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Good luck.
Here we go again.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
We're coming!
Come on! Come on!
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Oh!
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
He's my father.
Yes. It's you Leia.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yoda, I must know.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Yes or no will do.
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
You promise you won't tell?
He might be.  I don't know.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
What was that bang?
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Weiss.
Brad...
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
No, don't do that.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Good God.
A decision had to be made.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What a guy
What guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
From Transexual Transylvania.
Who's Eddie?
Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I don't know.
Looks quiet, y'know.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes, I do.
You sure?
Yes.
I think he might be worried.
It's only temporary.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
What?
...T-thank you.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Yes.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
...And he called the reporters --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
What did you say about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
Oh, Rocky!
Christ.
Don't talk like that to him!
You busted?!
You's the novelty, Champ!
My side.
No doctor!
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
...It's very American.
...Still don't feel no heat.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
How was the flight, Champ?
Hear she's retarded.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
I don't like ya face.
Don't like yours neither.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...That's an old one.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Few minutes?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
How 'bout some Cokes?
I say ya nothin'!
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
What about for food an' stuff?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
...Thanks.
Mr. Balboa --
Sparrin'?
...Screw you.
What'd you say?
Hey --
What?
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
I said, how ya feelin'?
...What?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...Who'd ya fight?
Spider Rice.
...No.
Think about it.
Ya puttin' me on?
When was they here?

What's happened is freak luck.
Whatta' those?
How 'bout a glass of water?
Really think so?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Yo, Benny.
Don't you care what the people will say?
God bless ya, Rock.
How am I doin'?
Ya nose is broke.
Wanna keep goin'?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I'm thirty myself.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
...Maybe I better forget it.
It don't matter.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How ya feelin'?
Whatta you think?
Ya really like her?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Whatta these guys want?
Outta my house I want ya!!
...I can't haul meat no more.
...People talk to me more.
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What's this, Roger?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Is this paper even good?
Check the scrawl.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you decided to help him after all?
What was <u>that</u>?
Sounds like singin'.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
You?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
No...
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he?
Hold on a second.
What a gasser.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
When will I hear from you?
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
No, I don't.
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Does this help?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
Two bits.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
No better?
Have patience!
Then I'll leave thee.
A challenge, on my life.
By my head here come the Capulets.
Good-morrow, cousin.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
In love?
Out--
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Good heart, at what?
At thy good heart's oppression.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Where is my Lady's lord?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Amen
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Pink for flower.
I will follow you.
I thought all for the best.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Do you really think so?
We kept it...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Well I don't!
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
It's been known to happen.
Not to me, you know that.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
About time!
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I still am.
Is that right?
Duty calls?
I didn't say I was.
You sure about this?
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
Don't do it, Sam!
Do you have the material?
Do you have it?
He's company.
Where's my information?
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
We'll die if we stay here!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
Bullshit!
I swear...
Sent it where?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Then I guess we're set.
What are you doing?
Don't cross me...
He's tough, your American friend.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So this is what, a test?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
You shoot alright.
Not for long.
Long enough to shoot back.
Is that right?
It's been known to happen.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
They call me Swede.
Who's they?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
Cigarette?
He trusts you to lock up?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
As in, they own it?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Like Larry or Swede.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
How did you know?
It was at that.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
The Irish representative?
Very ugly.
I never made that claim.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
How could you have done that?
What the fuck happened?
Right now?
I'm not here very much.
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Time to quit.
That's a good question.
You have to stop doing that!
Finish the job...
And now...
What of it?
What happened to it?
Gaelic.
You sure?
Why didn't you kill her?
My man, how you doing?
I'm alright.  And you?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Can you get it?
I don't know what you're -
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Never heard of it.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Well someone's gonna find them.
It won't work.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
What makes you so sure?
I've got one condition.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
What are you thinking?
I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
No.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
How long is it going to take?!
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
You killed him...
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we're screwed.
That's right.
He killed her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
It's too late...
Two thousand...
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
How are ya?
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you sure you're OK?
OK.  I love you.
He's not, he's...
I love you Sally.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
I don't believe it.
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Test the product?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
Anything...specific?
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Have I seen her?
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Dwayne please calm down!
We're out of here.
I'm not asking.
You're never getting that much.
I didn't know you were coming.
I was in the neighborhood.
Anything in it?
There was more than that.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
This isn't right...
What the hell is that?
Winner six!
How much is that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I'm busy at the moment.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Oh, you American?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Hello.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Carter?
Who died?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Not Yu.  You!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Good at what?
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
He'll be back soon.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Slow down, baby.
What did you say?
Is it hot in here?
She's getting undressed.
Gimme the binoculars.
What's she doing?
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!
There's people up here!
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
Why did you help me?
Mind your own business.
What about a little king pao chicken?
Are you serious?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Hello, Benjamin.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Lee!
Carter...
We made it, man.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
New York City?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
What's going on?
Are you okay?
Master Ching taught me.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
He stole my wheel!
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Where were we?
You make the plate?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Stooly.
What?
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
You like it?
Now, that's American music.
Yes, I know this song.
That's not how it goes.
Which one?
This concrete?  This is still America.
Oh no.
What?
Oh my god. Griffin.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Not anymore.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
You don't like it?
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
My daughter.
Han?
Yes.
It's Griffin.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
See you at the wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
It's hurting.
I'll get the dress.
"Make the shot."
"Nothing but net."
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Look, he's running after her.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Of course we are.  Of course.
I don't think that's why she ran.
And you are?
I think you'd look good in red.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
They made me put my hat back on.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Twice...
Really?
How romantic.
Too much.
Seven-fifty.
Six-fifty.
Maybe someday.
Always a mood killer.
I don't know.
You don't know.
I'll have the same.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Kind of isolated.
Where did you disappear to?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
It's fun!  It's high.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
About a minute...?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I love you.  I love you.
I'm okay with that.
So am I.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Reporter?
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Lighten up, wahine.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
You okay?  I'm closing.
Good boy, Port Hole.
No.  It's my life.
You tell Maggie.
No, you tell her.
He's got a houseboat.
I hate boats.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Even when you were young?
Happy New Year, darling.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
What is it?
It's delicious, trust me.
Does it have wheat in it?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
What?
About forever.
You couldn't.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Oh!
What?
About what?
What was what?
He lost all the weight... there.
Can too.
No.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Becky?
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
M.F.E.O.?
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I want my money.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
What?
You know.
It's a sign.
Hello.
It's you.
Grace heard it.
It's been about a year and a half.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
What was it that made you know?
It's not that late in Seattle.
You don't like the one he was now?
Where's your mom?
No.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
It is not --
What's tira misu?
What is it?
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
You think so?
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad --
Not.
Fine.  Fine.
So I can go.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
I know.
It was sinking.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Listen to this --
It's a sign.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
What are you doing up?
I was thirsty.
Everyone at work heard you.
God, she's beautiful.
Who is Annie?
Have you seen my wallet?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
What about camping?
Hi.
Hi.
You look good.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
He's ten.
He's good at it.
I read an article about this ...
I read the same article...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
You're welcome to one.
Mornin'.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
How goes it?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Who? A scab?
Are you sick, Mama?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
This water's cold again.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
I'm a fool.
Was it expensive, the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
You all right?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
I waited up till midnight.
Hunting.
When?
Sun up.
Alone?
You mean Delaware?
Forgot what?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Bobby?
What?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
You like that?
Who wouldn't?
Yeah.
Everything go?
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Leave me out of this.
This man sounds like a real catch.
What?
Nothing.
I can't.
Why not?
How far out of town?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
And you admire that?
This has nothing to do with him.
How much time do you have?
What is wrong with you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
Who is it?
It's me.
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
Ass first into the world.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
I don't want to leave you.
Who is it?
Twelve
I know a guy.
My features. They're Finnish.
You don't say.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You want a hit?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Danny?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I can't tell you.
You don't trust me?
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
Make me an offer.
Anything for a dear friend.
Pull your pants down.
Come on, guys ...
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Shoot him.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
I've got a hot one.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Thanks for not judging me.
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Question is, what are you doing here?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
That's because he doesn't have one.
What? Is it bad?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
This the guy?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Yeah.  What about him?
Turns out he's connected.
To who?
Who the hell is Jimmy?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
That would be me.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Again, I thank you.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You think that's a good idea?
What do you mean?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Where's Bubba?
What is it, drugs?
What is that? Rum and coke?
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
You writin' a book or somethin'?
You must be a hell a shot.
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Yes, sir.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
He ain't Wade.
No kiddin'?
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Not yet.
It's worth it.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Upham?
Pass.
I wasn't made for this.
I've been humming it.
I heard.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
What is it?
I wonder where they're going.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Captain, what about our deal?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Fresh out.
You get a translator, Captain?
Hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
PUSH!
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about I go right, sir?
I think you're right, Keith.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Yes, sir.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Frogs?
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Because he's guilty.
Understanding the following rights...
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
This evening is over.
For going to school?
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Good for her.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Keep it.
Lloyd?
I hope you understand.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Yeah.
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
No, no, don't go in there.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
That's not even a scam.
Then what's love?
Look at those eyes.
C'mon, just do it.
C'mon Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
Yes.
See you tomorrow.
Did you sleep with her?
What does it say?
I don't feel anything.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
I'm sorry.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Do you love him?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Honey!
I swear to god.
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
No, but you stole from them.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Hello.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Alright.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Thank you very much.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Friday?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
So you're monumentally busy?
I'll go.
Pardon me?
Goodbye.
What are these?
Twisted?
You know what?
So what's your job this summer?
Job?  Being a great date.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Today is tomorrow.
Nice one.
You think so?
Me?  Sure I do.
Stop by later.
Okay, bye, I will.
What did you say?
Be friends?
Yeah.  With potential.
Okay, this is important...
Are you comfortable?
No.
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
Then why are you shaking?
Your letter came yesterday.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me?
No, we don't have to say it.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Well, I need to study, and...
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
No, I don't, I don't.
Did you talk to Corey?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Did you tell anybody?
Just my dad.
Then don't do it.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
One more time would be nice.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
No.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
She's very successful.
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
My car.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
No way.
Lloyd.
Oh boy.
Ooop, excuse me.
I was gonna...
I love you man
We're full on bonded.
What's your name?
Oskar, please -
It's not a charade, all this?
Luck.
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I just told you.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Yeah, okay.
Good.  How's it going?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Thank you.
Christmas presents.
I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to you later.
I didn't do enough.
Have you checked the...
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
He's broken his pattern.
I won't.
Shit.
What is it?
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
Who is this?
What if I said you?
What if I said goodbye?
Hello? Ted?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
Cotton.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It’s over, Cotton.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Tons and tons.
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
What are you going to do?
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
What's your subject?
Not one bit.
Where's Sid?
She dumped me.
No way.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
About what?
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
Go on, untie him.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
What guy?
Need some help, honey.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We had to have financing.
Hello, Dwight.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
I see you read the book.
You have every right to be upset.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I know that.
You broke my heart.
Can we turn the light on?
And it's sexier in the dark.
..and as lonely as I am...
They're roomates.
Ssshh! What was that?
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Dewey, there's no such place.
Who is this?
What do you want?
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
No, wait...
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
What?
Yes, goddammit!
Where is your attacker?
I have rehearsal.
He tried to kill her first.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
That was good.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
And white.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
Hello?
She's not here right now.
Take it off.
But...
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
What are you talking about?
I'll be right back.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Jesus.  Hello?
Who is this?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
More of a game really.
What?!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Where are you?
To see your reaction.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Oh yeah, how?
What does this have to do with Sid?
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
The killer called her.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Sid I can see you!
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Off the record.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
What?
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Sidney, what happened?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Gale he's got Dewey!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
Huh, fine.
Hello.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
Roman that's not the line.
What?  What movie?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Yes.
What? She asked.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Ready?
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I wanna let go. I do...
Sshh... it's okay.
You heard me.
Are you serious?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I thought you were...
NO! Don't believe him.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Yes.
Who are you trying to reach?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
I don't think so.
Popcorn.
You're making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
What do you want?
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I believe you...
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
That all depends on you.
NOOO!
Please don't do this...
Don't do this. I can't...
I don't know...
What's his name?
Michael... Michael Myers.
But you're doing so well.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
...leave me alone... please...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
He's not a suspect, is he?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
I'll call for backup.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Did you reach my Dad?
I don't know. I guess.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
Afraid not.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
I was first to respond.
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
You think he could still be in town?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Where is she?
What? What?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
What's the delay?
I'll look for it.
I'm not here to fight.
Please. You owe me.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
Why would she lie about it?
Are you alone in the house?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So where are you?
So where are you?
Uh-huh.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Hello?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
...out at the airport...
Have a good trip.
Stu was with me last night.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Working, thank you.
Stop. Right there.
For about two seconds.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
And what would be your motive?
What's Leatherface doing here?
He came to make up.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Wanna another beer?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Why are you doing this?
You're crazy -- both of you.
The official term is "psychotic".
Or a man's mentality.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Thanks, Tatum.
Whatever. Just hurry.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Take a message.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
I thought you dumped her for me.
Give it to me.
What do you think?
So what?  This victim...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Have you heard?
No, I haven't heard.
Yeah.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Give me the gun.
Where we headed?
Murderers?
A woman...
Delusions of grandeur.
You should be thanking me.
You just met me.
Not here.
Drop it.
Who said this was murder?
You think it was poison?
It's too soon for him.
It's my wife.
How's that?
What about sports?
You go to movies at least?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
There must be something.
What?
I wish I still thought like you.
Does this make it with you?
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Why would we?
It is Victor.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
Sorry about that... I just...
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
We don't know for sure...
How much money do you have?
How do you know all about this?
It's not what you think it is.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Wait... just wait.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
You do your job...
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Kiss me on the lips.
Stay with him.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Tell me it's not true.
Don't do this... please...
Anything... anything missing or different.
I don't see anything.
Are you absolutely certain?
This painting...
How long have you lived here?
It's a hard place.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
How's California?
How should I know?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
He cometh forth like a...
What good does that do?
What in...?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
That's what I said.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
What you goin' to do?
Good night...Laurie...
He just couldn't wait...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Think she means for us to follow?
Ethan, quit it!
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Was your niece about their age?
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
She's not a little girl any more.
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Don't go takin' that stuff...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
I have to cut his windpipe...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
It still worked in town.
Hey... the fuse.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Do you have a better idea?
What are you doing?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
I miss Tommi so much.
Who was that?
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
How did you get me out of there?
Hello.  Can I help you?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
Do I look like it that much?
Mrs. Straub!
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
You didn't tell her!
Tenth floor.
Follow that boat!
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
You have the last act?
Wait!  Will you desist!
We have no Juliet!
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
How much?
Ten pounds.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Interesting.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
So now you are free to love
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
I have a wonderful new play!
Put his feet in.
It's a comedy.
Cut his nose off.
A share of the profits.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
This time we take your boots off!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Is it going well?
Very well.
But nothing is happening.
it will be all right, madam.
What happened to Sam?
Who are you?
Do you know it?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Who is she this time?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
What? Who?
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
How goes it, Will?
Burbage says you have a play.
Ethel.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
This is a different one.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
"Out."
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
When the Queen commands it.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Your Majesty.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
You have opened the playhouses?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
My lady!
Who is there?
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
There is.
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
You would not leave me?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, do not go
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Then I will go with you.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
But all ends well.
My lady Viola.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
I . . .
Wait there.
Yes, sir.
Do you understand me?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
And break her heart and mine?
She loves me, Thomas!
Here we come at last, my lord!
Is there a man?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
What do you think?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
Think about it.
Come on, David.
No.
You call them if you want.
So who's going to do it?
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I can't do it.
I don't hear this.
Finished.
Don't you worry about that.
That was good.
Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
I don't know.
How much?
What is this?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're sure? There's lots more.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're not eating.
You looking for me?
Who?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Cover it?
Well?
I don't know.
Is this being recorded?
This is just an informal discussion.
Are you recording it?
What does it look like?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
Well, is it?
What?
That's it, then.
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
That's right.
And you like it?
Cameron?
Yes.
Did you know --
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
She hated you --
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Know and love?
I think you're lying.
You see, they don't really know me.
David hasn't seen him either.
So I gathered.
David?
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
So?
Yes.
Now?
Alex.
What? What's wrong?
What are you doing?
I'm just looking.
Don't.
What?
Unfeasible.
I thought we all were.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
No, I don't.
What's he doing here?
Hello. Hello.
You know we're right.
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
And the money?
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's the only way.
I refuse.
You'll wait in the hall?
Alex.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It's about me and David.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Interesting.
So, uh...
What?
It's OK. There's no problem.
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Burglary?
Downstairs.
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
Just get on with it, Alex.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds?
Expecting anyone?
No one. I promise.
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
Sorry?
Here.
Right here?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
But they sneer, don't they?
You get the job done.
What guy that died?
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
You must be Juliet.
What's it about?
A priest who dies.
Writing seems easy.
Do you think you could answer that?
No.
It was some guy called Brian.
Working nights?
And he's a patient of yours?
For what?
The human condition.
You know about it?
I write about it?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
You can tell by the intonation.
Your watch.
Is it real?
Chicken salad.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I thought you were in a good mood.
Don't you like her?
No, it's a very groovy girl.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Lester.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
What're you looking for?
Thanks a lot.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.
Gee, that's very serious...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're late, George.
I don't want to talk about it...
-- What?
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I don't want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I can see that.
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
Your husband?
Yes.
Is she all right?
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
Oh, no.
... what?...
That headboard.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Her?
Shit.
Hungry?
No thanks.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
No thanks.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
... just, you could look very heavy...
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
You are.
I am not!
Right now?
Right.
Wonderful woman.
And you need money?
What sort of references do you have?
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
George!
Buffums?
I've got heads here, Norman.
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
-- Well no. It never came up.
No, thanks.
Well, what do you think?
You would?
Yeah, I think so...
You don't seem very sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Whew.
What's wrong?
No.
And?
And what?
What?
Did you?
You know what I'm talking about.
George...
Yeah, baby...

-- this guy with Jill.
-- don't you want to --
-- you are.
-- gee...
That sounds like me.
He still having parties?
Am I entertaining you?

-- ass and legs --
Look who's talking.
What's wrong?

Where are you going?
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
So I'm saying it...
God, there's Lester...
Wanda...
Yeah!
Wash her.
Otis is dead.

-- please, please forgive me...
-- why did you come in today?
-- how did you get here?

Jackie Shawn.

Not yet.
I have to see you.
Hi, George.
There were some shots.
What're you talking about?
I just... who what?
George --
Keep moving --
How are you, baby?
What about me?
You're different.
I am?
You're great.
I am?
Do you really mean that?
Honey?
Yeah, baby.
Will we live together?
Maybe you don't even like children.
Of course I like children.
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
George.
When can I talk to you?
Going where?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
No, but I think they might.
What do you want?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
When I get off work.
When is that?
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
Jill says nothing.
Where's your car?
Never mind. Where've you been?
Ha, ha.
Television or movies?
-- go ahead.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
That was him.
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Obviously.
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.
I wish you'd go now.
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
Stop it.
Yes, yes, I did.
What're you here for?
No.
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
It's an unusual trade.
In a way. But...
When?
... she's very upset...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
I know it, I know it.
Well... who are those guys?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Why, why do you think that is?
Want a drink?
No thanks.
Have a drink.
What about Jackie?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
You really think so?
Yes I do.
What took you so long?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
No.
No.
I'll call you back.
Come on by.

You're home.
I'm coming over.
No you won't.
Okay.
A soap?
I was too old.
You do?
George is going to open a shop.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Of course not.
What's that?
They get hair all over the place.
No.
Does she know about us?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Hi, Leonard.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Poster-Kleiser.
Oh yeah?
That's right.
I'll call you.
See you later.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
-- No. No really.
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
But you have problems?
I'm exaggerating.
How much?
Jackie --
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Honey?
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Egypt?
That's right.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
I'm terribly sorry.
-- no.
Good for you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You're going?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- I'll get in the back --
-- there's not much room --
Jill.
-- yes, Jill.
Thank you.
No, it's not that...
No.
Are you married?
No!
Have they sat down?
Call me Les.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Dad?
Yes?
You mean they ate each other up?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Dad?
Dad?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Maybe he showed me something.
What about Room 237?
Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
It's so pretty.
Mom?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
No.
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
Do I have to?
Please...
What sort of injury did he have?
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger!
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Pleased to meet you.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
It's good to see you.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
What time is it?
What do you want me to do about it?
Did you find anything?
And you didn't see anything at all?
He's still asleep.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Wendy!
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Stop swinging the bat.
Wendy...
Go away.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Mr. Ullman?
Yes?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
They'll love it.
I don't believe they did.
shut in together over long periods of time.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Hi.
Lowe's car-?
Blue. This blue.
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Yes. Go away.
Where's Mom?
Please, Uncle Al.
For getting a divorce?
I've been hearing noises in there.
What kind of noises?
Rattling. Rustling.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
Sure.
What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
Was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I saw what I saw.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
What you say?
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
You know what we're saying!
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy.  He's...
Yes, Mary?
SING!
But I'm fearful!
SING!
And I'm tearful!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
And you listen to that?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
His ashes?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What did who say?
No... it's fine.
Yes?
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh, girls.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
Yes, Betty?
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
That machine.
I know.  It's ancient.
What is it, Mary?
It's true -- I know her.
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Wet behind the ears.
It'll be hell.
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
Babies
JUST SING!
Come on, we're late.
What?  What time is it?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years.  A rookie.
Mary Clarence!
Bobs
I'm getting experience.
Mary Clarence!
Goddamn it!
Oh my Lord!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Don't you know it!
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
What did He say?
Your name?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
What? 
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
What's a concubine?
No problem.
The vow of obedience.
And the vow of chastity.
My what?
And whom would you call?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
But... wait a minute...
But...
What are you doing here?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
And if I don't?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Me too.
What're you doing?
Hey, girls.
Really.
Then one day they find you.
You won't even tell us?
But you didn't tell me!
A nun?
And if she runs?
It's done?
Not... totally.
Get her!
There she is!
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
You didn't shoot!
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
It should be here any minute.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Is this like your old convent?
He's decent.
It's better than ice cream.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Not a note.
Reverend Mother?
I lied.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Where?
They spend two days in chains.
You must have missed your mark.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No bleeding.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Stains of blood.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
They need guidance.
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
The Western Woods.
Are you familiar with magnets?
Father said witches live there.
What is it?
Listen.
We are leaving.
What is it?
We should go.
All I saw was their lantern.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Did your father take a loan?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Lady Van Tassel.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
How are you?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
People have put their trust in you.
And this gives worth to butchery?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
To avenge his father, and the others.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
What are you doing?
What... what are you doing... ?
What is so urgent?
The church.
What was that?
I... I can't do this.
Yes, actually.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
What... what are you doing?
He rides tonight.
She has confessed.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I guess it's all good.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
About a half a mile I think it is.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Sure, I guess.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
What's in your bag?
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Yeah.
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Did you want to play ball with us?
Yeah, I did.
Who did you kill?
Two people.
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
I like the way you talk.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A boy or girl?
It was still alive when you buried it?
No sir.
You don't want to give away all your books.
I've got a feelin' today.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I'm ye boy.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get your things.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
You better go get 'em.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Karl, you up?
You scared me.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
Do you have family here?
So, you're really going to stay here?
That boy wants me to.
How long have you been standing here?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
And what are you, his chaperone?
Will that be cash or charge?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Are you closed?
Yeah, I did.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Uh, better make it one.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
She probably died.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
What do you mean?
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
Bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
What is this, some kind of joke?
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
And why the hell would you give me money?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
And you told your nephew about it?
You going to sit here all day?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Hi there, little brother.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
Aren't you going to say anything?
So what's the time?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I owe you something.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In Manhattan?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Are you going to be all right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
I don't know. For helping me out.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
I don't know.
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
And started to run.
And started to run.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Medium rare, please.
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
I don't know.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
You're implying th...
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
Did you write that column?
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
How long you have this detail?
You said three minutes.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
We don't let go, you s...
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
You must think I like losing.
You want me to say that.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
No spare.
I don't think so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Is it possible?
Are you absol...
He had no reason to.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Wanna see my driver's license?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
You're right, Joe.
No we're not.
Hey, Joe!
I told you - it's a sure thing.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
Nellie told us about it.
I think they got me.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
My name is Josephine.
Now you've done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You know - the old shell game.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
And where's he going to be?
With ME?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
What happened?
I am.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
You think he's too old for me?
Jerry - there's another problem.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
That's some nerve!
Joe -
Sugar?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
OH!
Are my seams straight?
I'll say.
Good night, Sugar.
Good night, honey.
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
And you've got cold feet.
What did you say?
I'm not that sick.
You all right?
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
What's the surprise?
We better have a drink first.
I'll carry the instruments.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
I'm a what?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
We don't have to run.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
No!
You like it?
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
We could dye our hair.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Most of the time I slap it.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
This is where I get off.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Daphne...
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
Pleased to meet you.
Another bridesmaid?
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
I don't like no witnesses.
What's the job?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Where did he conduct?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Rough?
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Want to switch berths with me?
Would you mind terribly?
Thanks, honey.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What makes you so sure?
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?
I don't think so.
Thank you.
Who are you?
I'm not interested at all.
Well, I'm not.
How's the stock market?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
- Inauguration balls -
Well, I guess I'd better go -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
What?
Guess!
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What a beautiful fish.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
I don't mind if I do.
What's on Thursdays?
It's the crews' night off.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
See?  Nothing.
Nothing at all?
I don't want to bore you.
Is that anything?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
Good night.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Did you have a nice time?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I cut myself shaving.
You shave with your spats on?
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
What for?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Perfect. All ginny.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Are you sure you’re okay?
Hey.
You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
Does Kat know?
Where’s Nick sleeping?
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Shrink, actually.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Seeing you again....
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Hi. Hey.
I don’t know.
What does your gut say?
What?
It’s cute.
A weekend?
How did you know that was me?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Yes.
I guess so.
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Yeah. You?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Hi.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
You knew?
You want me to let him in?
Dad!
Hi, kiddo.
I always wondered what happened with us.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
Uh huh...
That does it...
What's his name?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Yes, Miss Johnson...
No, Miss Johnson...
Can you swim?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
But, Charlie --
David Lee...
Well, looka here...
Hi, Daddy...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
He'll show up one day.
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Goodnight, Daddy...
They gone to the field...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's your daddy's name?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David!
What's in there, David!?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Ready to go, Mama!
Who is they?
Any sign of Sounder?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Good night, Mama...
What's that you carryin'?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
What's wrong, Nathan?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Good mornin', Nathan.
You ready to eat?
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
What...
Behold my glory.
What... are you?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Montana.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
Is it Cartman's mom?
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Hey Cartman.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

Hello there, children!!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Viva la Resistance.

Donkey raping shit eater.
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
What's the password?
Guess.
SHIT!
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Dude, we don't have watches.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's so very cold...
We can't leave without you!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
How can they do this?
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
This is sweet!!
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Shiteater-
And Bill?
Yes?
I'm needing lunch.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Hello, Conan!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
AGH!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Who's my cream puff?
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey, I'm missing the party!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Got it.
And ze rope?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Evening.
It can't be.
Excuse me?
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
All too well, captain.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Barnes?
It's time we lock coordinates.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Is that clear?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
We're going to die.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
OK...it's open.
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Dawn!  Dawn!
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
I'm not going with you.
Dawn.  Come in.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
So close...
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Will you marry me?
I'm going back for Taylor!
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Well now what are we gonna do!
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
I'm looking for a man.
What kind of man?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Three whips. To go.
La da da dalala...
You know, Elvis bowled.
Think he bought it?
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Buzz Fazeli.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
What's it look like to you?
I'm your blood.
We ain't married no more.
Hello?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Cool!
I don't like to talk about it.
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
You shouldn't touch her.
Who's there?
Junior.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Look who's talking!
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
He's my father, Millie.
Where can I find him?
What's your specialty?
Uh...over easy.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
The mental hospital.
Mind if I cut in?
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Can I ask you something personal?
I'd rather you didn't.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
So, what about you?
Do I want you?
No, I'm fascinated.
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What's plan C?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
Why should I help that old fuck.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
How do you get this thing down?
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
He's dead Sheila.
I feel sick.
Are you sure he's dead?
You don't get two chances with Junior.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
What about plan C?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Sez you!
I am a professional man.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Tell your little pal to let go.
Very good, busyboy.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
It's burning...
Get out of there!
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
There's heat coming the door.
Wait a minute --
I said back away.
Hold on --
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nobody move.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Direction's east coming!
What if it attacks?
Fifty yards and closing.
Forty yards.
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't do it!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Anything else?
From what?  What's with all the security?
How deep is he?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Hold on --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
They pressurize us with helium.
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
You don't want to know.
-- and then brought her down here --
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Going active.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
They've left, keep watching!
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
So how do we get it open?
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
She's not gonna know.
I'd also like it noted --
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
How can he be missing?
To what?
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
From the sphere?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
Resetting the sub.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Wait -- down where?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Where'd this come from?
The library.
My gosh, Norman.
Wait a minute.
What?  Why...
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
What are they?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You did, didn't you?
Don't do this.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
You fixed my suit?
You don't trust me?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
You get it straightened out?
That wasn't in there before.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
You think?
Page 87.
But how?
Diphenyl parlene.
Something for burns.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Riordan?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Antibiotic.
How do you spell it?
It's a soporific.
What's that?
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
It's an idea.
I'm sorry.
For what?
The sphere looks different.
What's wrong, Norman?
I'm feeling better.
How do you feel about snakes?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
Do you fear them?
Don't you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
No, he isn't.
He can't manifest.
C'mon -- what?
That's when you went in the sphere.
That's bullshit.
What?
You hear that?
Beth --
I don't get it.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who?  The fish?
Then what is it?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Just in time, too.
You holding up alright?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Don't be defensive.
I'm not being defensive.
You sound defensive.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon, Norman.
Our answer.
This answers one of our questions.
I can't believe that, Harry.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No.  I didn't say that.
What noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What are you still doing here?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Did I?
... you there?  Norman?
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Her suit's gone.
Wisconsin's your answer.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
The three of us.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Did I kill her?
We're never gonna make it.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
I can't reach her.
Hold on.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
No idea.
Well, press something!
What is it, Harry?
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
But it's impossible.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please.  It must have flown here --
Good idea, Ted.
Does this mean what I think it means?
How are the others?
The others, sir?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
No, they didn't say --
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
Huh?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
He wasn't feeling well.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
I don't see anything.
Please, Ted.
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
Was it a military crash?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
I know that.
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
What is it?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Here come six more... grid two!
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Who's the pilot?
This isn't going to work.
Why didn't you say so before.
We'll send a squad up.
No need, everything's under control.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
See Threepio... do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Something... I've got...you don't.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
It's what I deserve.
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
What's the hurry ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
I don't believe it !
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Are you alright ?
So what are you doing later ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
They revoke our flight status.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
WHERE IS IT ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Carmen...?
Where are you going ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Carl can wait.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
How do I know if this is love ?
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I can't help it.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Sure.
Uh, look, Diz...
Guess you gotta go.
No thanks, Diz.
Man, they're defended... no way in.
Way to go, amigo !
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Hey, Diz...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Oh, my, what's that ?
Looks like rain.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
Mister Rasczak ?
All dead except one, sir.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
<U>Why</U>?!
Our data is being prepared.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Departure angle on viewer.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
You saved the ship.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
<U>Computer off</U>!
It's taken control of the computer...!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Hello, Ilia.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Time to impact...?
Mr. Spock?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
Hold station...!
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
We're ready, sir.
I'll be there.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Go you Huskies?
I want to rent this one.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
I quit.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
You get what you pay for.
That's true.  You grow up here?
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
Yes...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You'd know better'n me.
<u>Yes</u>...
Me?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What happened?
What are you doing down there?
...lost the screw...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
Thank you.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You can do it.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Sure did.
Yes.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
That's right...
Hi.
Where you going?
How's your star?
Press still works.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
...and we could get up every morning...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
But that's what happened.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Water or mineral deposits.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been...
Who is this person that you've found?
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...they run on water.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Bobby, don't say anything.
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
What do you drink?
Bourbon and Milk.
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
I'm very sorry to...
Of course he...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
I think he's moved...
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I wasn't in the car.
You have no right to...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I, actually yes.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
I like you, too.
But not that <u>way</u>...
You have to hide.
Who is that...?
That's my...
Claire, when did you...
I just...
We're just talking about the...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I can't do it, Walt.
I know that...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...yes...
...wants a piece...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
An artist of your caliber...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
I can't tell.
Why not?
Kiss my ass.
Who got their heads cut?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Where you off to?
Main Street.
I have to talk to you.
Arrest him.
What is the...?
He told you that...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
What's in the case?
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
He should be put in jail.
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
The writer.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
What's the...
I can't.
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
No, what is it?
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
The girl was in the car.
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
I don't...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
You cool the broad out?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
They're coming Fedex...
I don't got the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Pay her off.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I've got two days to get this house...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
You hear that?
She coulda done better than him.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
Ben!  What's wrong?
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
It just slipped out.
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
How would you know sh...
...why do you think?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Wow.  Who's that for?
I can't hear you.
I said...
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
This'll work, huh?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom?  What's wrong?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'll miss you so much.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
She still packing for her trip?
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
Not use my words, please!
Ice cold water.
There you are!
No they're not.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
...your hating me.
You touched it.
No.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Poof!  You're happy now.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Mommy?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
So we'll...radiate some more?
That's necessary, huh?
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
Rachel's not half my age.
We're not discussing your age.
I'm worried.
Easy enough.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
We...
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
What happens next?
We don't have any coffee.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
But it's not on the schedule!
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
So why did y...
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Jackie?
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Look, you've never liked me...
Did I hear the word...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
You bet you are.
I don't, but...
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
And you said...?
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
It's just not the right time t...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
And I'm going to win.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Why didn't I?
What do I have that you don't?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
So I'll have to order in?
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
She's not gonna die.
I told her I loved her.
That's not us.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
Hey.
There are some rumors...
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Nice to have you here.
Consuelo?
Really? How many?
I did not go to high school.
Must've been hard being poor.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Speak English.
My Jesus…
Who is Jesus?
My baby.
You have a bay?
I am sure.
Why was he on Death Row?
What's an audience going to tell you?
Mom?
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
What do you want?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
The same. Same as what?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
One in a million recover.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
Hey, Mikey!
Come here, give me a hug!
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
It's over there.
Say, Ni...
Ni...
...gger.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
'Fuck me hard!'
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Hello, is this Pam?
Who is this?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
Yeah.
Huh. Kids?
Yeah.
Great. How old are they?
Yeah, sure.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I know.
Is it loaded?
You know...I like you.
Yeah. I know.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
What now?
--be prepared.
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
Now what?
Because I'll be firing at them.
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
Enjoying the tour so far?
Come on, drink up.
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I say we head out.
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
What does that mean?
Possibly some coffee?
Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Yes!
Go back to sleep, baby.
Well, Mister President.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Who do you think you're talking to?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I suppose they are, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?
Where, sir?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
I want to talk to General Ripper.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
What else could it be?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
What?
War.
Speed?
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Call them every five miles.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
I think they mean business.
Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.
I've got one.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.
Can't "Ace" help you?
He's dead.
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
Like hell it does.
That's the point.
I don't get you, King.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
That was really great.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Yup.
What's it about?
It's really not about anything.
A cloud.
Right now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
It's your birthday?
Don't let 'em fight.
Sorry.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Okay, okay.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
No. Life is too short.
No, I mean, no one.
Yeah.
I know, man.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
No. It didn't, Buff.
What?
Look.
Hey, man.
What?
She's dead.
Bullshit.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Come on.
Great.
Hey, man.
Your his publicist?
Sure I am. It's fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I can come visit?
You better! Yes!
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
It's okay.
Good. See you later.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Whoa!
You could do it.
I could.
Yeah!
Yes!
Yeah!
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Okay.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Yes.
He is.
What'd he get you?
A Porsche.
I'd like to.
Oh, yeah?
Deep down. Way down.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Taking care of business.
Oh, sure.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
I'd love to read that.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
He's drunk.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What? What'd you do?
That chick, Erica?
What'd you do?
You don't know?
Just go home, alright?
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
Why we're just standing here.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
You could've come over.
Oh! Trim it!
No.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, you asshole.
Of course I do!
Name one.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
But do you stand for anything?
Yes, I stand for -
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk?
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
This is ridiculous!
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
What feelings?
Of course.
And?
New ground?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
You do.
Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Oh, yeah?
I, yeah.
For a ride.
To his hotel?
I've run out of words.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Oh, no, no, no.
You did, huh? Good for you.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
What?
Yeah, I crash there.
Sorry.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Now?
Well, not exactly.
So who are you?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Hey, where's Erica?
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
Look at you!
So? What's L.A. like?
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I'm moving.
If...
No, I'm going.
Soon.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
No car.
The fuck not?
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
I'm in, too.
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
You sure?
But, we have to make a smart plan!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
That was gas, Sweetie.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Oh no...
That you?
Hello?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Ammo?
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
All of you!
Bank branch!
My best friend got pregnant.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Roll 'em.
Give me your coat.
Let it ride for a while.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
What's wrong with it?
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
You forgot this.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
As for instance?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You'll be waiting for me?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You sure have.
I'll make it short.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Who's Norma?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
I don't want it now.
What happened?
You bet.
Hers.
Hello, young fellow.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
And you'll play Salome?
Well?
This is fascinating.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I don't know.
What month?
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
It's getting kind of late --
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
You can stay here.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
I need some money right now.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
How about some evening clothes?

Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Don't bend back like that.
Who?
What are the notes?
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Have one of mine.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
Where are my cigarettes?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I think I'll read a little.
I went for a walk.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
You are not dressed properly.
Madame is waiting.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
I'm not here.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
How come?
The doctor suggested it.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
Joseph C. Gillis?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Haven't got a thing.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Bring something to drink.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
A Storm Dragon?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
What do you want?
Is this Nigel's doing?
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Don't leave me.
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Let's talk about us, not her.
We can't do that.
Why not ?
What's that?
Is this how?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Away. From you.
That makes it worse.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
You think so?
I don't see why not.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Before you go...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
How do I fight it?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey! Ethan!
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
A passionfruit smoothee.
Oh no, not you again.
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Well...I guess I can't.
Hey, where you going?
I've got things to do.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
I can't help it if men notice me.
You bet your ass.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
There isn't any.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
I'd rather not talk about it.
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
Your hair looks the same.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Why is he acting so strangely?
Lucy; come back!
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
I have to talk to you.
A cheap trick.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Others?
I knew it!
But it's impossible.
You're going to take me back?
You can use the wand.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Not enough vodka in it.
There's no vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You know what's the problem?
You...um...you never got married?
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
I can never get a way from it.
He really was!
Uh-huh.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Do you really know Superman?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
Yeah.
What kind?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
How many sugars?
Gus?
Black or regular?
Columbia.
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
KRYPTONITE!
Is this whitemail?
Fair's fair.
For what?
A computer.
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Stone mutha.
You want to mess with Superman?
Watch out for them air pockets!
No, we're just going down.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Who's the other woman?
What about me?
Thank ...you.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
There's no rush.
Lots of things...
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
I don't know you, lady.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
I can't see anything.
Turn on the light.
I can't! It's out of control!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
85,000 dollars.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
It could make weather!
Storms! Floods!
She's not his mama either.
Today coffee----
Where did it come from?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Jimmy, how's the -
Are you okay?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Maybe I could try --
It is kinda romantic.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
It's true. It's true.
I was right. you are Superman.
Maybe you wanted to.
We'd better talk.
I want to.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Hi.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Everything on it?
Does Lois know about this yet?
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Genius!  --  Lex.
It's beautiful.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Where?
North.
Why?
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
What more?
Put down Lex Luthor !
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
You are master of all you survey.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Oh . . . my . . .
I'm not so sure you do.
Well, I don't understand.
Daddy . . . ?
Yes, darling?
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's that?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
We'll all fry.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
Nobody else.
He's thirty-five years old.
I've been on the job.
Keep warm now.
Your bookie?
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Not...gray.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Stop him, Clark!
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Can I take you to the airport?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Screaming
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You think he's for real?
Nuts. He made it.
Bet he makes it.
Damn!  This will get him.
What's the temperature now?
I read the article.
Meteorites!
You're happy, aren't you?
We just take it?
Ready?
Don't let me down.
No news is not good news. Y'know
A night on the town instead of under it?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I'm wearing it.
I mean the other one!
You can't do this to me!
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
It's a ...baby.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
He will be odd, different.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
I guess I got carried away
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt!
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
You've got me? Who's got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Right on the first guess.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
I came to talk to you.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
It must feel great.
It's not bad.
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
What's the matter, Otis?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I broke the man out of prison --
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
On radio waves?
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally.  That's right.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Yes...fine.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Which one?
Which one?
She didn't.
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
Alison.
Say hi to Zoe.
I hope she gets better.
I understand.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
They just finished supper.
Are you sure?
Why?
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
Billy, please.  The children.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
She's resting.  In her room.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
Yes.
It's natural.
Good night, Billy.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
You believe that?
I have to.
Because I have to.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
For rabbits?
From what?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
And what's that?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
That would complicate things.
He knows that?  Billy?
Yes.  He does.
You've talked to Billy?
What other people?
That's what he said, is it?
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Yes.  It's a present.
What's a ditty again?
Nicole?
So he was mean?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
I have no questions.
Will you be spending more than a night?
What do you mean?
Crafts.
Tell me about it.
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Here we go.
DADDY!!!
Daddy?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
I tested positive.
I need money.
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
What is it?
I'm a lawyer.
No.
You've been retained?
Are you expensive?
What time in the morning was this?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
You are?
I was scared.
Yes, I understand.
Why were you scared?
That was great.
You mean it?
What's that?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
The ramp?
Pretty slick, eh?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
He's somewhere...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Why, has he bothered you before?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Not being partial, are you?
Sidney is a liar!
Who said Sidney?
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Can I come in for a minute?
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Uh huh.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.
Get Steve back his job...please...
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
And who's feet is she on now?
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Talk to her, Sidney...
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
I don't think so.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
In his apartment -
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
What sort of thing?
What would you think of me if -
That's the third time he's called today.
But...
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
What's the matter?
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
J.J., if you think -
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
I made you write a beautiful song...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
No good.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
My mission is to protect you.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
What does that mean?
Liquid metal.
You sure?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Everything.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Alriight!!  My man!
She intends to change the future somehow.
This is tactically dangerous.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'll deal with the police.
Drive for a minute.
Is it dead?
Will it melt in there?
I have to go away, John.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Out of the way, John!
No!  Don't kill him!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
Ready to rock?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I love you.  I always will.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
You look like handmade shit.
The CPU from the first terminator.
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
On all what?
On Furtwängler.
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I'm very sorry.
I guess it's possible.
So, what does the Russki want?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
What?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
No can do.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
No. Ours was damaged.
I made no deal!
I don't buy that.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
How?
I was warned.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
I wish to say something.
And what was that?
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Yes, von der Null.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Of course I know what that is.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
That's what I asked.
Do you know what's in this archive?
Major.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
One of your people told me.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Right. Claims assessor.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Can you handle it?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
You're a big help.
Alright, the beige one.
I hate the beige one.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
What's it to ya?
That's none of your business.
Do you understand?
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
You cold?
Freezing.
I caught one, back there.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Okay.  Talk some more.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
My whole life has been combat.
He'll find us, won't he?
A girl.  You know.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
And so you feel nothing.
It's better that way.
I don't think I like this.
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I can help you...
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Call her.
I just called.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Don't just stand there, get help!
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You've got to be kidding.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I'm sorry, about this...
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
It was a gift... from my brother.
No.
There's a ladder here.
This is C.R.S.
They'll love that.
You're the one who started running.
There goes a thousand dollars.
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
Nice.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
What is it?
Is this you?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Take the picture out.
They're watching.
What are you doing... ?
What did you say?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
All I mean is... someone like you...
Scams, con games.  How many?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What... what do you mean?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
Nicholas...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
We searched the house.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking...
Nicholas...
Shut up!
Don't move, you bitch... !
I have to get to the airport...
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Originally, Connecticut.
Big family... small?
One brother, one sister.
Studied acting, I assume?
Julliard, yeah.
Single?
Yes.
Boyfriend?
No.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Never better.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Yeah.
You need anything?
For you.
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Like a stroke?
Will you?
I said I would...
But, will you?
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
I'm going to call.
Tell me where we're going.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
What have they been doing to you?
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
How did those... ?
You're part of it...
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Really?
Yeah.
Robbed?
I'll explain someday.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
What kind of vacation?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
And if nothing's lacking?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
The key?
Is there a room key?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
Is everything alright?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
What makes you ask?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Not much, I think.
Did you worry about him?
Goodnight.  See you home.
No.
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What the fuck... ?!
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Attractive...
Don't ask.
What's happened...
How concerned should I be?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Uh... Nell Vance...
And those are Luke's and mine.
I didn't do it.
Yeah.
You want company?
Are you working with her?
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell!  What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
It was.
Why?
Come on.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
That?  That's Hill House.
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
Oh God, we can't get out!
What do you want?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Is there something about the house?
Yes.
She was unhappy.
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
What did it cost?
That's why we're here.
Jeez.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Yes.  I've missed it.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well?
Are you sure?
I think so.
What'd you come back for, babe?
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is that a problem?
Am I a thing?
It's not a knock.
As soon as you get dressed.
What kind of food?
Anything but Japanese.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Italian?
I'm sorry.
Italian.
I like the colors.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
No.
Why not?
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Fuck you.
I wouldn't talk.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I didn't expect anyone.
Huh?
Boomerang.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
What?
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
What's so fucking funny?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
You goin' back inside?
What d'you say, Elaine?
Not much -- you?
Same.
Really.
You just cooking then?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.
Been busy, have you.
How d'you mean?
That's not what I heard.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed.
Something like that, yeah.
-- Your employer?
-- Mr. Lindgren.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
Why not.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Get seven years, did you?
Overnight.  What about just now?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Only in the movies.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Not that I recall.
What'd your father do?
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Where's Big Sur?
Up the coast.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
How do you know?
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
All of what?
Of the deal, man.
And that is?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Been away a lot.
How much.
Five thousand.
Hey.
I got half.
Yeah.
Which kind?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
She's nice lookin'.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
There is?
Something's on.
You bet.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
So why would he want to see you.
Is Valentine here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
You've made it ... brighter.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Who's looking for you?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
You must know Ian.
Thanks.  You, too.
What.
Tell me.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
...I stank, didn't I?
He didn't say that.
But more or less.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Huh.
You're an enthusiast.
Birdy--
...You are ze fahzer?
You got the dough?!
No problem!
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
Cash.
That'll be fine.
How ya doin', Ed?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
She's a rare one.
...Ed, I...
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Please, Ed.
But it's...
...Dave?
Told what?
Honey?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...What a knucklehead.
Who?
Dave.
How's that?
...What's so damn strange about that?
Honey.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Should I... should I tell you why?
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
I don't know. I don't think so.
Oh, hell. Drink?
I'm fine.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
So--
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Ed, how're you holding up?
I don't work here. My wife does.
That was quite something.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
...Ed?
Yeah.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
Huh?
This hair.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
...We goin'?
I don't understand.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
What'd he say?
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Hello!
Could you come with me please?
He's a barber.
Ah.
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
The body?
What's left of it.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
You're kidding.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
Dr. Green has to see you!
It's still back there!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
What does it say?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Curious.  There's something missing.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
I'm not giving up.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What are they?
I'm coming with you.
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
What's that?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
Big as a house.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
They were yellow!
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Shut them up!
Oh... my... God!
Oh no.  I smell it.
What?
Mbwun.
You were going to be married.
What happened?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Gone.
That was D'Agosta.
The planetarium!
What is it doing?
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
Help someone!
You smell that?
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
<i>A month.</i>
You want to book the flight?
Close up?
What's to see?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
What have we missed?
We're not watching the sea.
Why would we--
Cue music...
What music?
Welcome.
Amnesia.
Are we talking Emmies?
Who are you?
How can they have a child?
You take Japanese.
Oh, yes.
Lauren, right?
That's right.  Lauren.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No.
Well, what do you want to do?
You think so?
I've got to talk to you.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
I told you I can't.
What're we doing here, Truman?
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
I won't be late.
Where have you been?
I've been thinking--
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
I know.
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Arrah!
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
I don't know--
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
How's your hip?
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
See you tomorrow, Truman.
I think you better tell us.
We don't even know you.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Poopy day?
Yup.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Working with?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
And if it's unsuccessful?
Who?
I'm looking for him.
You looking for him for some other reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
Those people were already dead.
Before the bomb went off?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I'm not sure. A virus --
-- You saw this experiment?
You told me you had answers.
You've been using me --
I've been using you?!
Mulder -- it's me --
Where are you, Scully?
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
Now what?
Had you.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Something's not right...
I wake you?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
Get dressed, Scully.
Why are you whispering?
I can't really talk right now.
What did you find?
Evidence of a massive infection.
What kind of infection?
This looks like new grass to you?
All the equipment is brand new.
This virus -- it... 
This is weird, Mulder.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Scully....?
Yeah...?
Where'd they go?
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
What? What happened?
We've got to keep moving.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
How deep does this go?
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I have answers for you.
Is she alive?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What about you?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Miriam...
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Sing a song of sixpence.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
I'll be fine.
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
...give a kiss to Edward.
I realize that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You don't know the procedure.
Agent Novak?
With Stargher I saw things...
You're sure of that?
COME ON!
You sure about this?
Yep.  Eloped.
They're hungry.
No problem.
You liked him?
What now?
Who says?
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Intravenous administration complete.
She changed the codes.
Catherine!
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
No.
What about narcotics?
Dr. Kent.
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Someone looking after her little girl?
I need it.
Now?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Den leuten.
Give her some cigarettes.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
You were awfully good.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
He has a little dog.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
His own doctor?
Drink?
Who are you looking for now?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
Tell me about him.
...to steal my girl.
Seemed like a good idea.
It's just what he used to say.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
Let's go away.
What are you going to do?
I wish I knew.
What happened to your hand?
A parrot...Let it go.
Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
How do you know?
That's his headache.
His.
Oh, well.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Thank you.
...parents.
They're Harry's.
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin...
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Must you take those?
They'll be returned, miss.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Just around the corner.
Yes, of course.
Can you tell me whose...
Yes.
Been here long?
See much of him before that?
Holly Martins.
Him dying like that.
Ever seen one?
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
What the devil?
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
Well?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
So would I.
Bring him in.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Fifty yards right down there.
Didn't I?
I said you win.
What time is it?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Well, there's not much time.
Shall I go over there, sir?
Do you know his number?
No, a major, were you really?
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
I want to talk to you.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
Unwise, Holly...
What do you want me to do?
As long as they can use you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Coffee.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
...the best way one can, you know.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Dr. Winkel?
Thank you.
Find out?
Speak English?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Could he have been conscious?
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
Yes.
The Roumanian?
Funny?
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
No.
Joseph Harbin.
Third Man.
Should I make it all fact?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Where are you staying?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm Daffy.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Nice work.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
So how many miles do you think it is?
Everyone ok?
What!
Big?
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
He tried to borrow money from us.
It's on an island that no one get to.
One kilometer
Two.
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
We swim.
We lost our key.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
They don't have extermination camps.
Fucking Danny, man...
That's a movie, you moron.
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
What do you care?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Why the fuck not?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
What's he care about?
Why won't you talk to me?
Where'd you get this?
Even though his dick is so big?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I told you, I'm good at this.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You gotta get out of here.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
Who's Eichmann?
What'd you say?
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
I don't know. Is that right?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
He has Israel.
Those aren't Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Listen to me....
I always won.
To hear them read Torah.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
I can't say that.
I don't do that.
You do it on the inside....
No!
Daniel Balint.
Balint?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
What is happening?
What about chicken?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
I've got to get back to the --
Who told you that?
Who knows what that is?
Which was his room?
You could do it.
Open it up.
This will be a different kind of device.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Oh, what is this shit?
Who even knew?
Mrs. Moebius.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
You remember Miriam....
I can tell....
And what did you do?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Who's this?
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
So what?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes.
Does he know?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
What d'you mean?
What's happened??
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Yes.
Where did you two meet?
Congratulations, Enzo.
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Jacques!  Johana!
What are you doing here?
What else is there?
Because you'd laugh.
... Not yet.
Don't.
Ten thousand.
Lira?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, wake up!
Where did you get that?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
The rules are the rules.
And... does the voice come back?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
It's okay.
People say that?
No, no!
Not at all!
Enzo?
What?
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Here...  Here...
You don't have that one, do you?
You say that because you have the title!
No!  I would never cheat you.
A drink to warm up?
In the lake?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
How do you know that?
Hello?
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
... Not at all.
You sure?
And you?
What?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Are you sure?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
In my apartment?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
Well?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What are they for?
Who... Who is that?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Wait!  Professor...?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Want to get a drink?
Mordechai?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
A stereo type alarm system?
I wasn't too over the top?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Mmm———yes.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Then what do you do?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What do you want to see him for?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
What's left of him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Don't look at it!
See you tomorrow —-
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
Hey —— I'm over here.
Well, I'd best be off.
That's right, of course.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
About Charlie's leopard?
No.
It was you.
That was unfortunate.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Yes. The lipstick.
——	As long as my feet held out.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
We stood here once before.
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
Will you please come with me?
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Have you got a pen?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I’m really sorry you were not called...
Black suits you.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I don’t.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Something like that.
Something like that?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Crow what?
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
By your Austrian?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
I’m calling about the puppies.
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Ever seen him before?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where?
What?
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
B-Black...
Where is it?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
The £1,000 is on account.
What happens now?
Vous êtes Français?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
This car needs petrol.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
Five to three. You’re early.
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Who else knows about the boy?
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
What about his girlfriend?
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
Cinq cents.
Alors?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Fuck...
If he had, you’d be dead.
So why didn’t he?
Try again, and this time be polite.
Cost what?
What’s that? A word?
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
I'll go.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Will you at least let me stay with you?
But... why... what's the point?
Do as I say!
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
Jeanne's alive!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Do you have a sword?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Am I... am I dead?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
God defeated the English, not me.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
But where are you going to be?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
In a village called Domremy.
How old are you?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Please... may I have it back...
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
He's feeling wonderful.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
His face.
5,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Yes... they were.
Good.  Where are the English?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Wait, wait...
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
We need another ten minutes...
Well...?  Shall we go?
Not yet.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Clear?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Why not?  He has good teeth...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Yes... a half-steed... white.
How many did he give you?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
What are you doing out here?
I might ask you the same question.
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Yes!
God asked you to do something?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
What are you doing on the wall?
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
Whose were they?
Who is this "he"?
He never says his name.
Why did she have to die?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I need help.
And how's Yurek?
What did I tell you?
Have you seen this?
Halina?
Henryk's in there.
I haven't seen him.
Tough luck.
It costs.
And suppose they take the table away?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
I can look after myself!
So, what's the news?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
Cow!
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
Where are we going?
Out of Warsaw.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Where are you hiding?
In the attic.
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
No sound at all?
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
On your property?
What for?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I don't want to learn.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You have to wash them.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What did she say?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
Hello, then.
You've missed this bit.
Play a gig.
Do I know any gigs?
You the owner here?
That's right.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
What's the line on Visitation?
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
What do we do?
You're late.  Where you been?
I had some appointments.
How much did ya lose?
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
If that's the way you want it.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Which one?
What about the other one?
They're still looking for him.
Yes sir.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You just worry about your end, kid.
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
You think he'll show?
No.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Henry.
You wanta wait for your share?
The wire is ten years outa date.
See ya and raise three.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
You got a back door to this place?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Yeh, he knows that.
So could Shaw.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
You're a lucky man, all right.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I don't know.  He took it hard.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
He'll never do it.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
You know how they are... sex...
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Cheer up, darling.
Said he stole his invention.
What?
How are you?
Another young man.
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
You're high enough.
Give it to me.
What is it?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
Which way did she fall?
Where did you get this gun?
Don't lie to me.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
You see how much we have to say.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
I know -- I know --
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
You can take that out to the car.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Not a thing.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Not without a warrant.
This gun yours?
No.
He's holding out on you.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
I said he hadn't written me.
Well....
Well, what?
When was that?
About three.
Goodbye.
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
Want to take a poke at him?
I'll get some.
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
Just what I said I'd do.
Why, you said...
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I can't! I haven't got it!
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I'm not telling anyone.
But suppose some business comes up...
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Well, don't you?
They'll want more than your word for that.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
What's that?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
You might have mentioned me first.
What hit me?
Who's that?
She didn't tell me a thing.
They were kidding you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Someone get a doctor.
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You dog!
I did find him!
What do you mean?
That's a fact.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Well, don't they?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
I wish you'd tell me who.
Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
Nick Charles here?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
Who fired you?
What's in the other direction?
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We've got rope?
For climbing.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
What do you figure it to be?
Missile!
Epps!
What about the gold?
You don't know that.
I've got no stomach for murder.
Then step aside.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Just keep quiet.
I have to answer him.
So you can give us away?
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
There might be something in there.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Invest it.
Take the binoculars.
Wh-what do you think--
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
They're not going to--
She okay?
SAY IT!
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Just be cool.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
I don't hear any--
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Where the hell is it!?
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
A whole lot of nothing.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Is it dead?
Wait.
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
We'll lie.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I don't want to die.
Sorry.
I pick that way.
Just let me rest for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Slip out your M-16.
And then what?
Shi'ites, I think.
Is that good, or bad?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
Why haven't they killed us!?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Which way do we go!?
Epps.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Australia.
He's not slowing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
Yeah.  So?
That's in two days.
Jaeger?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Iraqis.
I thought we were dead.
You have to go with us, Wes.
How long we going to keep this up.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You down?
Yeah, we're down.
What the hell are you doing!?
Maybe we should give him some water.
All last night he could have been--
I think he wants something to drink.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Stress category.
Correct.  Origin?
Drug evasion with....
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Permant cortex bond.
HUMMMM.....
4732...?
Vocasity
When?
Now.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I don't know.
I haven't done anything.
Don't take anything.
What are you doing?
Are you all right?
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
Who?  Who's leaving?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
Where is LUH?
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
When?.....How?
What?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
Which way?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
That's not it.
She's not there
No......  She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
Remember this...?
Where's LUH?
No...no you're wrong.
What do you want?
Just look at all those people.
May I help you?
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Coffee, Mike?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Anything else I should know?
So what were they doing here?
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
How long are we going to stay?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
Where you guys at?
Fuck factor?
Off the scale.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Which one's which?
I don't know.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Thank you.
Then why tell me?
What is that?
What's the matter?
No... No more killing.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Who are you calling, sis?
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
Prints?
Nothing so far.
He is!
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Oh shit...
Look who's talking, old man.
What was it this time?
You okay?
Mike...
It don't work-
Make an appointment.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Device.
A what?
So what're we looking for?
Nice to be here.
I'll do it.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
No!
About tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
And harems ... ?
Nice day, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Nice suit.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
I've got to see you.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
M'sieu ...
Monescu.
M'sieu Monescu!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Major. 
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
Please.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Two fifty-three, five--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Now, Lily--
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
I remember.
You like that statue?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Oh! You didn't read it!
Naturally I did.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
Peaches and cream.
Do you know my first name?
Eighteenth century.
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
The same thing.
I'll be delighted.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Beautiful.
Hair?
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Correct!  Good night.
Good night. 
Yes, I would!
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
I'm crazy about you!
I know it.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Then why do you want to go?
Thirty-three--
Call the police?
Instantly.
You look beautiful.
Mariette!
<u>Adolph</u>?
Goodbye...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
No, m'sieu!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Two lumps, madame?
Please!  Thank you.
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I think you'd better go.
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
How much time?
The ship will sink.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Who's the best? Say it.
Holy shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rose Calvert.
None of the stewards have seen her.
I make my own luck.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Is this in any way unclear?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Sure. Count me in.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You're a good liar.
Bollocks.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
Could I speak to you in private?
Mr. Dawson, I --
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
Yes, exactly!
So don't marry him.
If only it were that simple.
What's this?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
And...?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
Are you nervous?
You're trembling.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
I promise.
Don't come any closer.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
I don't understand.
Will you pardon me?
What did you want a gun for?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
I'm so sorry!
I'll say she is!
Nice lines--
You've got lipstick all over you.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
So you washed it off!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
This is Mr.--er--
Brett is the name.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Isn't she attractive?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Yes?
Well, I can't.
Don't rub it in.
When?
At seven-thirty?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
A little.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You mean that?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Well, I'll be--!!!
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
How're the tips?
No, sir?
My change.
Thank you, sir. 
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Where did you hide it?
On the drunk.
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
I'm going to the show--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Sure, I'll go.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Here you are, sir. 
Where do you live?
Sure.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
Yes--Me--in person!
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Everything O.K.?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yes.
Very serious?
Meaning what?
Somebody's got to do it--
What's the matter, Mary?
I'm getting seasick--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
With your dry wit and humor--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
What's he got that I haven't got?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
He's all right.
Thanks to me.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
That's the truth--every single word!
There you are, sir.
Sure, Sis.
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
Let me look at it.
Ain't got time.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
God damn son of a...
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Listen, I want to talk to you.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
I'm retired.
Forget it.
That's the rumor.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Age quod agis.
Credat Judaeus Apella.

Virgil?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
It's too late -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'm sure they will.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Your new car. 
Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Shhhhh...
It must do something.
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Hey - the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
Can you arrange a meeting?
I got you covered.
Interesting presentation.
Interesting video tape.
... Does this do anything?
Married?
Happily.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
Thanks.  Take care -
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Nice to run into you again.
I hope you'll be gentle.
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He's killed closer.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
Sometimes you just have to -
If not?
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
What do you make of all this?
... And what do you call these?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Approaching the first gate.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
It's Bond!
Oh, no.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will it go off?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Do you think you won?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Now how far would further out be?
Your feet are cold.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
It's good to be able to hear that.
You must have been really sick.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
How is everybody?
That smells like fresh coffee.
Let me get you a cup?
Good afternoon, ladies.
Those boys never did have good luck.
How many people do you all feed?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
He is in his pigeon cage.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Wow!  Cool!
Whadda ya think?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Can I bring some toys?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Can I help pump the gas?
Next stop...
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
What?  What is it?
Which one can I open first?
We're almost there.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
No, you can't.
Yes, I can.
You can't!
Can!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
That's why.  Sid.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Woody, stop it!!
Come on, this way!
Shhhhhhh!
Woody!  The rocket!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
Hi!
Hey, watch it!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
B-3.
Miss.  G-6.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
What?
Hey!!
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
That ain't no happy child.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox?!
Who is it this time?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Toss 'im overboard!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
What the heck is up there?
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Sir!  No Sir!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Woody!  Speed up!
You'll put your clothes here.
There's no mirror.
I can manage.
I did like the music.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
He made that. In his off hours.
I want to go home.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
She'll have to learn.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're only a young thing.
You're not so old yourself!
Who's there?
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Finn -
I finished it off.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Did you now.
Surely she is older?
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
So had I.
Everything is gone, now.
I'm Melanie.
How much?
I want to believe you.  I really do.
How much do I pay him?
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Don't bother.
Carl, that's insane.
Carl --
That's frustrating.
I think she's lying.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
This is different.
My Leica's gone.
So's the video camera.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Is this bad for him?
Hi.
Hi.
What's up?
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
You can't make me.
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes.
In school?
Private?
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
What's that mean?
I get A's.  All A's.
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
So does half of San Diego.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
What do we do?
What do you think it is?
David --
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
Yes, sir!
We aren't barbarians.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Who?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Madrigal's alive.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What's your name?
What is the name of your informant?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Does this offer include my partner?
Only if he can be trusted.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I have money --
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Oh, man --
You won't say anything to my parents?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Who are these guys?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
I'm sorry.
Bit fucking late, like.
You've stabbed me, man.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I'd fucking kill you.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Where are you going, Diane?
Where's that?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Diane.
Ssshh!
Sorry.
What?
Out.
I don't see why not.
Because it's illegal.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
What do you want?
Are you clean?
Well, it isn't.
Smells like it.
You're too young.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Sixteen next month.
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
What happened?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Do you recall the school motto?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
There's no need.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Clear?
Aye.
That's nice.
Good luck, Spud.
You Only Live Twice?
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Director?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Say something, Mark, say something --
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
It wasn't that bad.
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
He made me lick it.
What was your price?
We're two thousand short.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
That's hardly a substitute.
you'll need one more hit.
Your favourite dish.
Your usual table, sir?
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
There.
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Where did she come up with that?
What?
A walk.
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
He has his doubts...
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Following new course. Warp seven.
Shuttle en route.
Raise shields.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Can we have it quiet?
Where did you get this power?
Join my quest.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
And that is?
Because it's there.
Ah, Captain?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Jim.
Life is not a dream.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
I cannot be certain.
I do not often think of the past.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Spock.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
There, you see? See?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Is it possible?
I am here, Captain.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
We must change our course at once.
No... I didn't.
Now learn something about yourself.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
You are mad!
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No special conditions?
What have I done?









And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Sybok, you must surrender.
No. I will not.
Each man's pain is unique.
I hide no pain.
Why not?
I belong here.
I don't get it.
Hi, Alan.
Want one?
To warn him.
Beautiful!
Come on in...
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Cute.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Flynn!!
Greetings, program...
A User -- in our world?
There's another beam!
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Watch it!
Feel what? You okay?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
So...how's the world of serious science?
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
What do you think?
Why is everything...like this?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
It's something Users do.
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
I'm shocked.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Where are you off to young lady?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Harry!  Where are you!
Harry?  HARRY?!
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Fourteen, Harry.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
She's still at my house.						*
I thought this look like your work.
He's got it.
Yes.
Oral hygiene?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I'm late.
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
Would you say he was boring, then?
And you agreed?
Yes.
Yes.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
What were you doing there?
What did he give you?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
I don't take those assignments.
Did you pork her Harry?
What is it?
God, you have great legs.
What are you going to do?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Boris and Doris?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Like one?
Tell me what happened?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
You'll call me then?
What is it you need me to do?
I don't know.  I have to think...
What do you want me to do?
What letter?
Not yet.
Let me speak to Clarence.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
Tell him we gotta go.
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Bye-bye.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Want some Goobers?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
What time is it?
I love to get pie after a movie.
How 'bout me what?
Tell me about yourself.
I don't remember.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Almost four years.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
What would make you think that?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
My pimp.
You have a pimp?
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
I do.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
No no no no no no no no no...
Where you goin', honey?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
What?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Cancoon.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Can you live with it?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
She's with me.
Who the fuck are you?
Clarence?
It's great to hear from you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
I'm a married man.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
This shit can't be real.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Elliot.
Elliot what?
Where?
Clarence.
In case.
Want an animal cracker?
What do you think, eightball?
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Don't you?
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Where'd you go?
Why does he trust you?
I can, but I don't.
Do you still have friends on the force?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure. No problem.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Do you believe him?
Not a tiny little vial -
You're no longer an extra -
Or a bit player -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
How the fuck could he know?
We gotta get him outta there.
What was I sayin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Sorta room-mates?
Wake up, Cole.
Well?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Change what?
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I have to go.
A jail?  Prison?
Underground.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
It's so clean.  No germs.
You're afraid of germs?
July.
No, 1995 is the past.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
"Never cry wolf!"
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
James, why don't we...?
Mason???
Give me the gun.
I thought I was in...prison again.
What does this mean to you?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
What are you talking about???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
How did you find me?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Nine thirty
Might be tight.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
Where in Mexico would you like--
One way.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You want somethin'?
You Harlin?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
What time is it now?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Two-hundred.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Let me have a Beck's.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
What's the matter?
You didn't hear something?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Jake, what is that?
What does it look like?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car.
Do you have to call me that?
I don't know your real name.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You sure you can manage?
Thank you, John.
I just drove in this morning.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
What?
Like you.
I have ideas.
You love him?
No.
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Yeah.
Take me with you.
Where?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
What are you talking about?
What about us?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Where's the safe?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Let's do it here.
Where are you going?
To get my car.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
I shot him.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
Are you all right?
I think I busted my leg.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
Where the hell am I going to go?
What for?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Who the hell are you?
I'm her husband.
A lot that means.
You've got to be--
I'm a solid man.
Would you?
Would I what?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
Now what can I do for you?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You didn't kill her?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, me too.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
It's the truth, Jake.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I want to stay.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you.
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hey!  You there!
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?
Who the hell are you?
A lot that means.
You broke my nose!
You've got to be--
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
California...
Would you?
Would I what?
What can I do for you, lad?
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
Shhh! Liar.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You Harlin?
Nope.  Darrell.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
How much!?
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Two-hundred.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Look, Harlin.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What you want?
I want my car.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
I call the sheriff.
I'm just going to my car?
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
You sure you can manage?
No, I've got it.
Thank you, Bobby.
I just drove in this morning.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Nice place.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
What?
Like you.
I have an idea.
How do you know he's still not here?
You love him?
No.
I'm guessing no.
You could leave him.
I don't know how.
You'd never understand.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
What about us?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Bobby? Are you all right?
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
Harlin's.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
I need a ticket.
Where to?
Out of here.
You got a beer?
What kind?
What's the matter?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
I want to stay.
Yes?
Four.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is Jeremy okay?
He's asleep.
I don't know. It's been a while.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
When was the last time I wore pink?
Yes.
...I think rust.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
What was that?
I'm not sure.
Think carefully?
What about the game?
What's he talking about?
Just give me a minute.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
I thought he was carrying something.
I have to go now.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's kind of a miracle.
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
I'll help you.
How much is it?
All of it.
I see.
I'm not scared.
That's great.
I know now.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
I'll just shoot him once.
Yeah, hello.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Well, go get it then.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Rain's coming.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He's coming ain't he?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Are you really going to kill them?
Your wife?
Yeah, I guess.
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Mmmm pistols.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Yup.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
What's your name?
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
N-no, sir?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Well... I don't recollect.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Better re-load it.
You missed him? You didn't...?
They takin' water?
When we gonna double back?
It's gonna get riper yet.
You still think he's in there?
Is it him?
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
Say, Bill...
That was... the first one.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Wha... what f-for?
Lemmee see it.
You... gonna take... the money?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I... I... think I'm... shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Two weeks, I guess.
He musta been movin' right along.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Yeah.
Beats the hell out of me.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
You're marking us, Bill.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
I seen him.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Did you... did you... ?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Well, suppose he does?
We'll bury him.
An' if I spot 'em?
Yeah?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
I know who he is.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
Why don't you just calm down'
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Did you hear what he just said?
You okay?
Three million?
Maybe more.
What is this?
What-are they speaking?
Let's say for example -
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
Someplace else, then.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
I know he was good.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
So this lawyer...
Kobayashi.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
You're joking.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... he wants to testify ...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
Yes.
Say it.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
We went to Code Blue...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
Neurology?
No.
I'm just an M.D.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
How is that?
Through, through his book.
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
I did.
Nothing further, your Honor.
No further questions.
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
That's not my handwriting.
I completely understand ...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She getting good care over there?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Dr. Gruber ...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
Thank you ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
You know what happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who are you protecting, then?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
Then why don't you testify?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
Why is that?
Thank you for seeing me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
Nothing further, your Honor...
Overruled...
Continental Casualty...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
D'you find an apartment?
The TV didn't work.
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
I've got to work...
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
And what makes you so tough?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
What are you going to do?
Dr. Gruber.
He's not in, Sir.
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Oh shit, what's today?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
You use their witness.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
The broad has disappeared...
What are you doing in New York...?
It's locked.
... I know.  I went ...
... You saw her?
She told me.
She did?
I just saw her.
In New York?
How old is he?
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
One hour.
I did.
A single hour.
Dr. Towler...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Almost a year.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
From whom?
I want you.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
What for? Who are you?
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
What about?
You.
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
It's a place to live, that's all.
I told you! Right here!
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Because I remind you of her?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
An hour?
Mmm.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Tomorrow night? Well --
No.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
I don't like it!
Wherever you'd like...
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
How does it work?
Can't you see?
Where are you going?
But why? Why here?
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
I don't know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
Where were you?
When?
This afternoon.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Wandering about.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
-- talking to you...
Would you like some coffee?
What?
Good-bye.
I don't know.
Shopping?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Do you hear anything?
Only silence. It's always like this.
And no birds sing.
Here with you.
Where?
The tall trees...
Yes...
Where were you born?
Long ago...
Would you know the room?
No... it's in shadow.
What else?
A grave...
How do you know?
There's a name on the gravestone.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
Why?
Let me go.
Her car is gone.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
It wasn't your fault.
From that music.
How's your love life, Midge?
Well?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
What.
Step number two.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Yeah.
Pop Leibel.
You haven't told me everything.
I've told you enough.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Midge!
Just wander.
Around.
Mm. Better.
Yeah.
Oh... this and that.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
What is it, a still life?
She died.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She'll be out in a moment.
Yes! That's it!
Can we have it by tonight?
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
How ya doing?
What's that?
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
Multiple reasons.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why?
This is pathetic.
You're pathetic.
What did you say?
You're not a team player.
I have plenty of friends.
The hell you do.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it!
There's more.
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Sun rises at 5:52.
We can't do this.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
I am not flexible on this.
What does that mean?
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
At the seven-eleven.
Who? What are you talking about?
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're driving me nuts!
We'll be ready Adam.
Are you solid with that?
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
I know and I'm honored...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
I got you.
My god.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
She's not here.
Who?
She's still working?
That's right.
Is everything okay?
No I don't.
But not tonight.
I got her arm.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He just had two.
You said that Boyd.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Call 911.
Nobody knows she's here.
I'm talking about prayer.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
He's cracked up.
He is not cracking up.
Boyd...What have we done?
What is the question you asked me?
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
What are you going to do?
Take care of business.
Okay fine.
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
The hell you didn't!
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
You hate women.
False.
True.
Israel doesn't have a King.
There's my point exactly.
What? What's your point?
Take Mexico.
We're goosed.
Stop it!
Stop.
What?
This is ridiculous.
The wedding cake check?
Sent it.
Photographer?
Sent it.
Florist?
Yup.
Caterer?
I think I forgot the tent.
You forgot the tent?
I think so.
Why?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
Well it's bad timing.
How do you figure?
He is.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
He's weird.
He's quiet.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Why? What's his problem?
Time out.
Do you love me?
Of course.
How much?
With all my heart.
Keith do not trivialize this.
Not padded ones.
So what do we do?
You go down there.
Honey I don't have the time...
I need your help.
We're leaving in three hours.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Hello.
That's sweet.
Well I do.
Well you should.
What are you doing?
Nesting?
Yeah. Nesting.
I'm mad at you.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Hello.
Hey. It's me.
Okay.
What okay?
What!
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Yeah. Sure.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
We're not canceling.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Yeah. You.
Don't even.
Who's dead?
The prostitute.
Micheal, by accident.
Call the police.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
He kept saying he was protected.
The only proof is those bodies.
So what do we do?
Move the bodies.
Just kills me...
Everything okay?
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
What does that mean?
It means she's insecure.
I'm not breathing right.
I don't care for him.
He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.
Go for it.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
I don't hear it.
The first day.
Did she believe you?
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
There.
What song?
The stone age.
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
Good times.
She's dead.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
I'll come to you tonight.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
Which couch?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Yes, it is.
And this innocent child.
You must think I am a monster.
You must listen to me before you go.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
How much is that?
Fifteen yards.
That's fifteen by seven?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
If you wake first, wake me up.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Are they going to work here too?
And ...your friend?
She's left.
No.
What's he called?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
You cannot leave ...
Why not?
Where?
Why are you crying?
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
A black bull came.
Very, very?
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
When you are, miss.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
How do you feel?
I have a headache.
Have I slept long?
Hello.
How did you see me?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Think you can do it?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I am beautiful, aren't I?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't need a baby—sitter.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
What the hell's going on?!
Enjoying yourself?
You know I am.
Which way?
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
We know you didn't kill those guards.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Nice work.
You don't know?
You okay?
...I think so...You?
More or less.
Sid?
How's your pulse?
I couldn't tell you.
What do we do now?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
...on the way in.
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
What about it?
It's <u>producing</u>.

Come on.

What rig?
What are you talking about?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
We are virtually certain it isn't...
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
<u>Do</u> it...

The American "people"?
Yes

It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...can we see the Kitten...?
Why is this putz on the air...
...take a long view.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Anything at the Airport?

Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.

What are we going to do?
War's over, Pal. 
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
"...where's my pill..."
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Where is he?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
What's on your mind?
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
What the hell...
Start unloading.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
About what?
Don't start, alright.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Your words, not mine...
Another cup of coffee?
I guess it's time to hit the road.
What if he asks where I got the money?
What if they call him?
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
...I can't make it tonight.
Hello Bud.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You really do believe in destiny?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Any better and I'd be guilty.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
It's over you, Gordon.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
With Mark?
Businessman?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Would you like a closer look?
Thank you
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Jenkins!
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
A party at a waxwork huh?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
They seemed, closing by much 
Tony and China?
What?  Tony and China, together?
That's not what you said last night.
Sarah listen to me.
Anyone else not coming?
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well divide 18 into three
Can this be stopped?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
What do you mean?
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Fireball?
These are good.
What does she look like?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
What's happening to me?
Yes, but...
Your friend saw them.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Do you?
Who's that?
Yes?
Well maybe your wife...
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
You're the flower lady.
Hello?
What?  What are you afraid of?
That's not...It's not like that.
I wanted to apologize.
And then you weren't there.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Mrs. Frank?
You know where she is?
No, I don't.
What's your name?
You look a little old for a student.
Why are you here?
They're calling me in to work.
Wow.
This is...
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
I came in from my room...
Good.  I'm good.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
What is it?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
What?
Seance.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
The planchette?
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Jody, she's alive.
But Claire--
Oh God...you knew.
I don't know.
Did he say that?
I think three...
It's today?
Claire?
If you have to work...
How are you?
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
It's just us now.
Tired?
Nope.
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
After that.
Of what?
Of him I think.
Mmnph.
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
I think so.  Maybe.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
That's...
"...for my father."
Did you tell her?
What?  No.  No.
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
It's a flare.
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
...Don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
How do you know this?
We had a seance.
Keep your voice down.
I'm sorry...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Yep.
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
The...
...I'm positive this time...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
Ow!
What's the matter?
It's too rough.
Who?
Your wife...
"You know..."
Who?
I tried to break it off!
She can't be here without me.
Adamant.
What's that for?
I'm cooking you dinner.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Mmmuh...
Shhhh.
What?
:Would you stop it!
I have seen him again.  Last night.
There are two.
Two what...?
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
Don't tell Rowan about this.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Nothing was ever more false.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Who is this...?
I beg your par---
When did she die...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I had you sent away.
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
What is it...?
She didn't feel them
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
uh - then he - be just -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
STOP!
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
There is no one here but the dead.
Go away!  I don't want you here.
If that were true, I would not be here.
I LOVE him!
Do not tell me that!
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
What is wrong...?
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
Rowan...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Harder...
Rowan...
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
You did that, didn't you...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
When aid you get home last night...?
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
On which planet...?
You can't just -
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
You really love this guy...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Which do you think is her best shot...
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
OH MY GAWD!
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
This must be one of the old keys -
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I lost the touch
My names isn't ANGELA...
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me how it happened...
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What's wrong?
What is it?
Where are you going?
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
It's been what, three years?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Dr STECKLER?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Sugar?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Check this out.  Hurry!
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Never say never.
What gives, Don Corleone?
You go first.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
You have changed since second grade.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
You guys are my parents.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
What do you want me to do?
You're on the next plane home.
My new bike.
You want it in writing?
He was my Grandfather, too.
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
Your article sucked.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
He phoned it in.
I see.
Your dad taught you everything.
It's all so complicated.
Eventually you'll let go.
You're amazing.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Well? Where the hell are you?
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
That's refreshingly deviant.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
Not a chance.
That's hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
You're quick. I like that.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Only the best for my mother.
You promise you'll finish school?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I never figured you for a pimp.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
Of course I like girls.
As much as possible.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I told you you could do it.
I was like a different person tonight.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
What are you doing?
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
People pay good money for that?
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
You look pretty.
And where might that be?
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
Maybe she used another name.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
If you want company...
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Will you do me one favor?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
About a year ago.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
I want a full-scale investigation.
A ride.  You want one?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mon.
Kelly.  What is it?
He... Sam Lombardo?
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Hello?
I love you.  Now give me the line.
I just want my life back...
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
No.
It doesn't look like it.
I had to go look for this coupon.
But she ran away.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Shit. Here we go again.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
J. S. Bach.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Aha!
That's a lot of butler.
Almost?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
At least I tried something.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
Know what this is?
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It's better than nothing.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
It's not a guy...
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
My God!  He's so excessive!
What is this?  A whole new train?
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Would that include me?
You've... done... this... before.
Your private train, sir.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
French?
Good work.  Really.
This is Colonel Richards.
No, sir... just a businessman.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Dr. Pemberton?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
Well?
They're coming.
You're not going to use it, are you?
You're chasing a dream.
Thank you, friend.
Willow Ufgood.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
I can't.
I can't.
Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Say what?
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
What's that?  I hear something!
You hear trouble.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I will.
Fresh goat's milk.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
I'll help you...!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Want me to carry Elora?
Watch it!
Kill him!
No!
You must learn magic.
That's all I ever wanted!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Ouch!!
His will.
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
Why?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Patience, Willow.
Get back here, Rool!
Maybe milking.
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
He was... like him.
How reliable is this kid?
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
Maybe.
You know who?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
They kid a lot.
But not a good tired.
No, no doctor...
Does anybody know I'm here?
Only the elders.
How long?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Something wrong with buttons?
Buttons are Hochmut.
But Stoltzfus said...
The... bullets?
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
But... You may not be well enough.
When will you be going?
I know.
You're so sure of that?
Where's my baggy pants?
Anybody know about this?
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Did you find him?
I don't know where he is.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
Good morning.
Who was that man?
No...
I am not a child.
You are acting like one!
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
She say where he is?
He's not in this building.
Get back in there.
My son is out there!
Momma... are they angry with us.
I don't want to stay here.
They are English. They don't understand.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --

Oil can.....Oil can....
Did you say something?
Oh --
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh - I'll get it!
We might.
What sort of an animal is that?
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!
...yes.
A home --
Yes -- let's run!
I'd sooner wait outside.
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, come on.

Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
They're coming back!

Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
They would?
Um-hmm.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
To Oz?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
What?
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
The other side....

Yeah.
Ah --

Somebody pulled my tail.

Fine.  He's got a plan

Whozat?

Oh --
No, you don't.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
What about us?
-- Ruined my exit!
You new?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
Who’s she?
Makes her look even more innocent.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
The King pipeline.
He’s sealed himself in.
What kind of bikes did you ride?
It’s just a scratch.
Construction’s not exactly my line.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Your last chance. Take the money.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
He was my father.
How long has he been with you?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
I can’t stay here.
No!  It will cave in!
I can’t stay.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
Then take me with you.
I don’t want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
You can drop the act, it’s over.
Where’s M?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
One... last... screw?
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
Now...where were we?
And the payoff on the tables?
Where’s the sub going?!
Where?
The Maiden’s Tower.
No! Bond!
Someone will come.
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
He was a...good lover?
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
The parcel’s in the post.
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What?!
Had a lot of blood in him.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
God isn't there to do it.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
I could stay and go.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
What -- am I --
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
I¹m not.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
His what?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
What are you up to?
They're following us.
They're practically on us . . .
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Coward.  Giving up.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
We should get back --  What?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Their real names, please.
I don't know their real names.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Maybe I'll do that.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Who the hell are you?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
What is this place?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Is that all?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
The scum of the Earth.
But programmable. And expendable.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Toadies right behind.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
This is your standard dart gun.
Nice hops.
Sorry, "dude".
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
I wish I could go.
I don't like him being here.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Into the Hudson?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
Anything else I can get you?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
By reading my thoughts?
If necessary.
Were you now?
Let go.
He takes his work seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
I've seen a lot of rings.
Dr. Grey.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
What is it you intend to do to me?
Where are we going?
To find Rogue.
I felt like she almost killed me.
If she held on any longer she could have.
Is that what you're looking for?
A piece.  Only a piece.
Is it enough?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Carlson!
Baack!
What?
Is it that music?
Darling!
Hello...?
Surprised?
Of course.
Yes.
And your passport?
Promise??
Will you miss me?
I hope you like large weddings.
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Goodbye, darling.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
That's a tough choice.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Good night.
You mean... the laboratory??
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
How long will this whole thing take?
Break that old man's violin.
One week at the most!?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Are these your bags?
I beg your pardon?
There wolf!  There castle!
Why are you talking like that?
The wockers with the knockers.
Home!
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Aye-gor!
Just putting up some tea.
What is this place?
What a filthy job!
Could be worse!
How?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
If you like -- just hurry!
Throw the second switch!
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
... I'm glad that's...
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
How's everything?
Get the sedative ready!
What's that tune that you're playing
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Well, this explains the music.
Oh, doctor!
A god?
Yes!
Right here?
Raise the platform, hurry!
I think you've done it, master.
What are you going to do?
Me?  Sing?
Are you serious??
Give him the sedative!
Did you do it?
Good night, Doctor.
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Just passing through the night.
Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
Why don't we talk inside?
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
His what??
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Another fifteen seconds to go.
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Stuart?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
